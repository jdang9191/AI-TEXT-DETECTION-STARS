"Initially, I didn't think much of it. It was my first night visiting my parents' home in over a year, and I wasn't too familiar with the layout of the house. I figured it was my mother in the other room, probably clearing her throat as she tried to fall asleep.
But when I heard it again, I remembered: *My parents aren't home yet. * They had left earlier this evening to go see a play in the Opera House. I glanced over at the clock. It wasn't even midnight yet.
A faint chill ran down my spine. If that wasn't my mother coughing--then who was? Maybe it was just a squeaky pipe or something. I crept out of the guest bedroom and walked down the hall toward the adjacent room. I put my ear up against the door.
*Nothing. * Maybe it was my imagination? I opened the door and swung it open. Inside was my dad's study, dimly illuminated with an office lamp sitting on his desk. I glanced over at the piles of old papers stacked against the wall, a remnant of when my dad used to work for the city...
The sound came again. It was a faint woman's cough, just like before. But this time it sounded like it was coming from the guest bedroom! I ran out of the study and back into my room. There was nothing in there but my laptop and bed.
As if taunting me, the sound came a fourth time, coming from--you guessed it--the study room next door. ""God dammit!"" I yelled out loud. I raised my fist and threw it into the wall.
I wasn't expecting my hand to break through. The wall crumbled away like it was made of paper, and a large hole formed around my fist. Inside the wall, my hand had landed on something... sticky. A putrid smell surrounded my nostrils. I immediately recoiled.
From within the wall, a single shape appeared, illuminated by the dim light of the guest bedroom: a human eye, staring at me angrily. It blinked.
""What the fuck!?"" I screamed out. I jumped away, running down the stairs and outside of my parent's house. I ran down the front yard toward the street--
A woman, dressed in black, appeared out of nowhere. It was dark, so her dirty face was only partially visible underneath the streetlamp. She had the same eye, staring at me.
I screamed, but nothing came out. The woman-thing approached me, her eyes burning into the back of my skull. She reached out a hand and touched my temples.
A vision flashed in my mind. A woman was laying in bed, coughing hysterically. ""Please,"" she said between gasps of air. ""I think I should go to the hospital."" I didn't recognized her at first, due to her nappy hair and blotched skin, but soon the realization dawned on me: this woman in the vision was my mother.
My dad walked into the room, holding a glass of water. ""No, honey,"" he said. He turned away from my mother and removed a small vial from his coat pocket, pouring it into the glass of water. He turned back around and offered it to my mother. ""Drink this,"" he said. ""It'll make that coughing go away.""
My mom sighed. ""Ok, if you say so."" She took a big gulp of it.
The image faded away. The next thing I knew, I was standing in the front yard, the woman-thing staring at me. A single tear fell from her cheek. ""Mom?"" I said.
Then, it hit me. I hadn't seen my mom yet since I came back. When I arrived earlier today, my dad told me she had already gone to see some friends before the show. ""She'll really hate missing you,"" he said with a grin on his face.
The apparition disappeared as two bright headlights approached from down the street. It was my parent's car, with only my dad sitting at the driver's seat. He pulled into the driveway and got out of the car. ""Son? What are you doing out here?"" He said, walking towards me. ""Anyway, the show was great. Mom's talking with director's wife, you know how women are."" He chuckled. ""So she probably won't be back until tomorrow morning... ""
""Dad,"" I said, trying to compose myself. ""What did you do to mom?""
He curled his eyebrows. ""What do you mean? I told you --""
""No!"" I said angrily. ""Did you kill her?""
My dad stepped back. ""Son,"" he said, a worried expression on his face. ""Why would you ask that? Are you... feeling okay?""
I ran away from him, going back into the house. I hopped up the stairs and sprinted into the guest bedroom, where I made the hole in the wall. The room really smelled like shit at this point. I peered inside the hole--and instead of the angry eye, I saw a half-decomposed skull staring out at me. My mother's body.
I fell onto the floor, reviled, with tears of terror streaming down my face. I picked up my phone and dialed 911. Outside, the car engine started and tires screeched as my dad's car bolted away from the driveway.",0
"I rush and unlock the door, except I am greeted by more darkness.
I rush and unlock the door, except I am greeted by more darkness. It stretches out in front of me for infinity. I can never escape. He was right. I'll never leave. I should have stayed put. Maybe I would have lived a little longer. Another hour or day or week. Do I want to live another hour or day or week though? I've been degraded, strung up against a wall naked. He's done horrible, vile things to me. How does a person come back from that? *Can* you come back from that?
I hear his boots on the ground, thundering. My weak legs give way, and I fall to the ground. I can feel the dried blood on my legs, and the fresh blood slowly dripping down from the new wounds he's put on me. What is the point in trying to fight anymore? I'm just a little prey animal and he is the predator. He's hunted me down, and now he's just toying with me. The little shard of glass in my hand scrapes against the concrete as I bring it up to my throat.
I won't be his play thing anymore.
I'm escaping.",0
"All of this preparation. All of the years and money. All on this phone call.
""Well?""
""Everything is ready. Give the signal""
Practically foaming at the mouth, I gave him the word.
""Fire at will""
I hung up the phone and threw it in the toilet as I turned my attention to the mirror before me

"He sat in a stark room with his old friend, the paper cup of water spilled on the floor. It had been years since they splashed in puddles together, climbed book cases, rode a wagon, or threw a water balloon.
They talked about the girl in class, how they used to play house as kids. They talked about the babysitter, show and tell, and making up answers on tests. They talked about making ""art"" out of snow, snowball fights, stories his dad used to tell them, and how, ""Life builds character.""
They remembered the time mom let him smoke, and the time they played cards with a marked deck. They talked about the machines they built together as kids. (Oh, how they were ahead of their times!) They talked about visiting other planets, and dinosaurs, and x-ray guns.
They talked about the life lessons his friend taught him - how to be thankful for the little things in life and hugs.
They stared at their reflections, then hugged, a final goodbye.
He whispered, ""Not so hard, you big sissy, you'll squeeze my tears out.""",0

Our systems are failing. The containment will fail catastrophically in no more than 72 hours. These are to be our final days. I wish our legacy to this world had been a more pleasant one.
I pray, to all the gods and to the spirits of my ancestors, that something good, no matter how small, comes out of our existence, and our work here.
2010/10/04 - a small flat in Akihabara, Tokyo
""Tomorrow's the day,"" Itaru said with a sigh. He slumped back in his chair, pushing it back onto two legs, then quickly - with more agility than I'd ever thought a man as big as he could - caught himself just before he fell backwards onto the floor.
""Kuroyuki,"" Mayuri replied, a sad tone in her voice. For all we had done in this lab - no, this flat - we hadn't been able to even find out anything about where the 'Black Snow' came from, or why.
I pushed myself to my feet, switching off the old tube television. ""These may be our last days on this planet, but even if they are, those who survive will never forget our names."" I threw my arms wide to my sides, my lab coat fluttering in the breeze the motion created, and I laughed my best mad scientist laugh.
EXCERPT FROM SYSTEM LOG - 5010/10/01
The substance is...replicating. Intriguing. We've been studying this material for 10 years now, and all we've been able to ascertain is that it is neither organic nor synthetic, it has processes similar in many ways to sentient thought, and now, that it self-replicates.
Shizuru - I mean Yamada-san - has suggested we attempt integration of organic life into its environment. We know nothing about this stuff, and she wants to see how it reacts to a tree, or a kitten, or a person. I always thought she was insane, the way she had spoken to the president that day, but this....
-Yamada's damned experiment was authorized. She is insane. I don't know how she managed to convince the superiors to allow this, but...Anyway. She introduced a cat into the containment environment. The substance...reacted immediately. Violently. Within seconds, the cat's flesh had been...dissolved. Not just torn off, there was no trace remaining. All tissue...simply gone. All that remained were the bones, and those...darkening. Changing. The substance had...infected the bones, and they are transforming into more of it.
4010/10/05 - Kuroyuki
I sit in my hermetically sealed room, and watch the streets run black. I wish I could do something, anything, to prevent this. All of the people I had called friends before I became...this...All dying before my eyes. My 'condition' prevents me from leaving this room, and my parents would do anyway even if I were well enough, 'no friend is worth sacrificing your life over', they would say. They don't know these friends. They don't know what we had been through together, before this happened to me.
A stray bit of the Kuroyuki from the last incident, they said. Somehow it had survived the nearly one thousand years between then and that day, two years ago. It had latched onto me, but for whatever reason, it would not kill me. Instead, it lived on me in a situation that treads the fine line between symbiosis and parasitism, feeding on my immune system to the point where even the weakest germ could see me dead, but strengthening me in other ways.
I would live, it said, inside my head, for more than one thousand more years. I would watch everyone I love die. And I would suffer.
But it didn't count on one thing. The sheer determination of the human condition. I would live those thousand-some years, and I would live every day to find a way to destroy Kuroyuki, once and for all.
EXCERPT FROM SYSTEM LOG - 5010/08/31
The president has called us into his office. Myself and Yamada Shizuru. We walk in, and stop before the hermetically sealed section. The speakers blare to life, and he speaks. ""Do you know what it is we are trying to do here?""
Shimada-san spoke first. ""We're trying to study the Kuroyuki,"" she spat, ""if you would let us get back to our jobs."" This woman is insane!
The president laughed. ""Yes, quite. But you see, we're not merely interested in *understanding* it. No, we want to *eliminate* it.""
Yamada chuckled. ""Why eliminate it? We can use it. If we can learn how it operates, how to *control* it...We can turn it on Japan's enemies!"" The glint in her eye said more. Said 'or those who stand in our way in any capacity'.
I kept quiet. What was it that one ancient writer had said? 'Better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt'? In this case, it was perhaps the wrong decision.
3030/10/05 - Kuroyuki
The black snow. It comes once every thousand years on this day. Flakes, black as the night sky itself, fall from the sky. The history books say that the first time it fell, at least in recorded history, people were in awe. They were enraptured by the strange beauty. Until it 'came to life' and devoured them.
One thousand victims, every one thousand years. Mostly Japanese nationals, but occasionally tourists in the wrong place at the wrong time, or on one occasion the 'storm' was blown off course by a particularly strong windstorm that was already in the area, dropping its full wrath on China and Tibet. One thousand victims, flayed to the bone - no, 'flaying' would leave a trace of the flesh - and the bones turned into more of the stuff.
""Black snow"". Too beautiful and poetic a name for such a catastrophe.
All of this races through my head at lightning speed, as I watch my hand become enveloped by the blackness. A single flake landed on my palm when I had reached outside to see if it was raining. A single flake, just one. And now my forearm is shrouded. It doesn't hurt. It feels like a slight warmth spreading up my arm, as if I was dipping it in a warm bath to test the temperature.
It's spread to my torso now. The warmth is...pleasant. Inviting. I know, in my mind, what this stuff is doing to me, but I can't get over how it feels. A spring day. A warm bath. A gentle ebb and flow of heat.
I don't know how I'm still alive to dictate this. The 'snow' has spread over my entire body. All that's left is my head. I feel the warmth rise up over y ih. I ah eeh ih-hayihh ih. Ih'h...ihe ho'h...
[LOG ENDS]
The body of Akihito Yamada was never found. All that was found at his apartment was this recording. Attached is our best guess at the last few words, cut off by the Kuroyuki finishing its grim work:
""I feel the warmth rise up over my chin. I can't keep dictating this. It's...like home...""
EXCERPT FROM SYSTEM LOG - 5010/10/05
Containment has failed. The substance is escaping. Replicating. It's dissolved Ichihara, I...System, note for the record that this log is being recorded by Shizuru Yamada, and that Kamui 'Ichi' Ichihara has been killed. The one person on this entire station - this entire *planet* - that I would have had any second thought for. He knew what kind of person I was, and he still stood by me. The only time he spoke up in opposition was when I requested permission to introduce organic life into the containment environment.
I've created a compound. One that, based on analyses of the material, I believe will break apart its cellular bonds like a hot knife through synth-butter. It was never my intention to destroy it, but...it wasn't my intention to release it in this state, either. Before I could control it. And it was certainly never my intention for...for Ichi to be...
To whoever finds this log, be it tomorrow after the stuff is gone, or in a thousand years after the rest of humanity finally remembers us and decides to come check in...I regret my part in all of this, but nothing more than my part in the death of Kamui Ichihara. I only hope this self sacrifice can do some small measure of good, and perhaps afford me some small measure of redemption, though I don't deserve it.
What...? The substance, it's...It's made its way into the TTT* lab! I don't know what it's...No! This isn't where it ends at all...This is where it starts! The earlier logs made mention of the substance's 'processes resembling sentient thought' - I believe we're seeing how closely they resemble it. The substance, in an attempt to escape either isolation or destruction, has opted to slingshot itself back in time using the experimental technology in that wing! Maybe...maybe I can change things, if I'm quick enough...Stop this before it ever began...

*It's not the writing I'm most proud of, but it combines elements of the prompt with elements of matters near and dear to my heart - time travel, science fiction, horror, etc. Between the idea in my head and the slight constraints of the prompt (yes, I'm aware that a prompt isn't meant to be followed to the letter, but I generally like to stay somewhat close to it, at least to the point where you can recognize the prompt in the story), I feel that while it's not the best (probably doesn't live up to even some of my own other stories, let alone people like Luna_LoveWell or any of the other great writers on this subreddit), it was the best I could do with what I had. *
*The characters in the 2010 segment may or may not be inspired by a certain anime which also involves time travel, but if you choose to make that connection rather than taking it at face value as just similar names and mannerisms, simply consider them an alternate worldline version.

"Ellie didn't know what she was fighting for.
Actually, that was strictly untrue. She know precisely what she was fighting for, and it definitely wasn't any of the things that the politicians on either Mars or Earth were talking about. She was fighting to stay alive; nothing more, nothing less. Richie and Lamont had lost that fight just a few hours ago. Bell, fearless, draconian, red-faced pixie-cut Bell, had lost that fight less than an hour ago. Ellie briefly remembered her cries, her groans, and her final pleading with her communicator to please connect with her daughter one more time. She had been fairly sure that the captain didn't feel pain, but Bell had barely been in one piece after the proximity mine exploded. The dissolving of Bell's normally iron exterior surprised her; in another situation, Ellie might have been touched by the scene, but this was not such an other situation. Ellie ignored the captain's words, and in her mind they blended into the background noise. They were just another hum of the generators, just another hiss of the ventilation system, just another buzz of the lights. Thinking back, she thought she heard the captain beg her to please take a message to her daughter, but she didn't remember. Just another hum.
She followed her training. She scavenged supplies from the captain's corpse. It was breathing and moving and talking, but a corpse it was, at least as far as Ellie was concerned. She took ammo, mess kits, and first aid supplies. She took a canister of oxygen, a utility knife, and a flashlight. She took many things, but no memories. When Ellie inevitably followed in Bell's and Richie's and Lamont's and Brandon's and Paris'and Kenna's and the rest's footsteps, nobody would remember her either. It didn't matter that she didn't remember them.
Ellie didn't know what she was fighting for, and she didn't care. She didn't know anything about the two humans in red she had shot dead fifteen minutes ago, and she forgot everything she had learned about the history of the Mars colonies, she just knew how and where to shoot them. She didn't know how the screeching rifles the Whites and Reds pointed at each other worked, she just knew how to use it to make the Reds stop using theirs. She didn't know how and why the deadly proximity mines in Martian Immigrant Complex 7 were placed, she just knew how to spot them and dodge them. She had tried to warn Bell about the one that she triggered, but the captain was distracted by her thoughts and didn't react fast enough. Ellie didn't have any such thoughts or distractions, not anymore. Ellie just survived. She would survive as long as she was better than her enemies at surviving.
Ellie moved quickly through MIC7. The complex had been abandoned entirely by civilians, and the United Nations vanguard had driven the defenders back and held more than half of the structure, at ""heavy casualties"". Ellie didn't worry about the casualties. Either she was one of them and didn't have to worry about it or she was not and could not afford to.
She didn't continue towards her objective, planting explosives in a generator room not so far away. She checked to make sure that her communicator was, in fact, not working. She turned down a side hallway in the cramped complex, one of the hallways that led to many places, but were known to not have cameras. She looked for the familiar black glint of cameras and scanned the room with infrared, and found nothing. She stopped, and listened. They had eliminated the last guard patrol that was supposed to be in this area not so long ago, and she had picked off two stragglers on her own fifteen minutes ago. The chances of any more enemies along this particular shortcut route were almost none, but you could never be too sure. She listened, and listened again, and heard nothing.
She was alone. And probably safe.
She looked down the hallway for the least suspicious looking room. The hall had several unmarked doors that seemed to be utility closets of various kinds, and a few machine rooms.
*Where would an ambush be? Where would wounded hide? * She thought that the wounded would hide in one of the closets, in as low a place as possible, covered in something. An ambush would probably hide in the machine room near the intersection of two hallways, to be able to make sure their targets actually passed by them.
She slipped into the machine room near the center of the hallway. She briefly glanced at the label on the door, but didn't recognize the language. Some kind of oxygen system. It didn't matter.
All the lights were off in non-essential areas as the Reds were conserving their power for the war. Ellie shone her flashlight around, pistol in hand, ready to pull the trigger at a moment's notice. She almost did when she passed over a vaguely humanoid metal pipe, but managed to stop her finger, which wanted to shoot at anything and everything.
The room was clear. She passed over it one more time to be sure, then pointed her flashlight up. The apparatus was in several large pieces, and it would be difficult to see on top of any of them from the door. She picked the second furthest one, and started climbing. She realized her tired her limbs were as she pulled herself slowly up the gently vibrating metal exoskeleton, but simple tiredness seemed almost an irrelevant problem at this point. She forced herself upward, and soon crawled on top.
She spread out a self-expanding bedroll and a foil light-absorbing sheet. It wouldn't be much good if anyone turned on the lights, but there wouldn't be much she could do in that situation anyway. She rummaged around in the various kits she had picked up for sleeping pills, guaranteed to be fast and dreamless. Her own had run out a long time ago, but it seemed a few of her squadron hadn't been too keen on the pills. She found a bottle, popped it open, and took three, two-and-a-half more than was recommended.
She closed her eyes and found herself quickly drifting off to sleep. As is the way with humans, it was at these times that our thoughts, memories, and conscience always catch up with us, and despite her best efforts, Ellie was yet human. Luckily, she could feel the pills taking over, but in those brief, lucid moments, she allowed herself to think.
Her squadron's mission would be temporarily abandoned; she would have been expected to continue or report, of course, but after being ambushed, losing their entire squadron over two days, and being forced into the underground section of one of the MICs, where communication was difficult to establish, would probably be good enough to get her out of tribunal. At least in MIC7, the victory of the United Nations force was almost inevitable, and Ellie only had to wait half a day or so, maybe at most a day, until the area was secured. Maybe she could shoot herself in the leg or something and get sent home…not that there was any way to get home from this hellish planet at the moment.
An image sprang into her mind. Lamont's face, a round, brown face with a scruffy black beard on a thin muscular man, constantly wearing a smile. Lamont would have taken a power nap at most and continued on the mission, probably solo, especially now that the area was known to be clear. He only had to plant a few explosive charges, after all. Lamont was a hero in everything he did. On Earth, he probably would have been the waiter who went the extra mile and a half to make sure a customer's lost order was fixed up, or the accountant who stood up against a corrupt vice president and fought a five-year long losing battle in the name of justice. On Mars, he got shot in the left arm, torso, and lower abdomen, because he was not correctly behind cover.
Lamont was a hero. Ellie was not a hero; Ellie was alive and in one piece. As sleep took her, she dreamed of herself sitting back on a sofa in her tiny living room, wrapped in a blanket, cold soda in her hands, and listening to soft piano.
She smiled in her dreamy state, the first time she smiled in God knows how long.
*Let's just go home and listen to classical music. *",0
"I wasn't really the type of kid who stood out, always sitting in the back of the class, shooting spitballs at other kids, getting told off by the teacher, but not being the giant bully you always run from. I was more of a class clown. But one time, I had accidentally hit that big bully in the back of the head with one of my spitballs. He whipped around and stared me down, and his eyes just screamed ""You're dead."" I squeaked and slouched back in my seat. ""Never doing that again."" I thought. The rest of the day went on normally, and I thought he was all talk.
I got to my house safely, and tossed my bag on the couch. I went into the bathroom, and took a quick glance in the mirror before starting to move to the toilet. ""Wait a second."" Something was off, so I moved back to the mirror. I looked closely, thinking maybe I had just imagined it, but then I looked again, making eye contact with myself. ""Are my eyes...green?"" My eyes are normally blue, why would they look green? I shook my head and went to the bathroom, but when I was washing my hands, I looked in the mirror again. Something was definitely up. I concentrated on my eyes, and jumped back as they slowly changed back to blue. ""It must be a trick of the light, my eyes wouldn't just change color like that."" I went and did my homework, nothing out of the usual.
However, when I woke up, I looked in the mirror in my bedroom, where I normally do my makeup. My eyes were hazel now. ""What the hell is going on?"" I stared myself down again until they turned back to blue. ""Am I doing that? Can I change my eye color?"" It was the weekend, so I didn't have any school to worry about. I looked at my eyes again, thinking about brown eyes. Sure enough, my eyes turned brown. ""What the hell?"" I thought maybe I could try some other things. Could I possibly change my hair color too? Just as I thought that, my hair changed color, to a light blonde. Cool. I jokingly thought of if I could become a boy, and suddenly before me in the mirror stood a skinny-looking guy, with the same blonde hair and brown eyes I had given myself.
I heard a knock on the door and jumped a little bit. Do I need to change back in the same order I changed to begin with? The door started to open, and the first thing I did was change my hair color back to its brown color, then quickly changed back to a girl. My eyes were still brown, but I didn't care because I was looking in the mirror, whoever entered wouldn't see my eyes. My mom walked in the door, telling me breakfast was ready. ""Ok, just a sec, mom. I think I got an eyelash in my eye."" I immediately mentally smacked myself in the head, now she was going to look me in the eyes. I quickly changed them back to blue. ""What's for breakfast, anyway?"" My mom didn't look too closely, thanks to the diversion.
""Oh, it's just some pancakes. You look kind of different, did you eat a Thanksgiving dinner in your sleep?"" What? I looked down at myself. Whoops, I guess the mirror makes me lose ten pounds. I was so focused on changing back that I must not have thought about what shape to give my body.
""I guess so? I'm not skipping breakfast though!"" I really sounded suspicious, my mom was bound to find out. ""Hey mom, actually-""
""Honey, did something happen at school yesterday? I already know you're a shapeshifter, the whole family is. Usually you first change as a defense mechanism. Then, if you're like me, you stand in front of the mirror for hours seeing what you can do."" That was definitely what I was just doing.
""Like mother, like daughter, eh?"" I pulled out my phone. ""So does that mean I can look like Megan Fox if I want to?"" My mom laughed. All the tensions melted and I went down to breakfast, changing back to my skinnier old self first. We both just pretended that nothing happened. I glanced over at my big brother, then looked at my mom with questioning eyes. She shook her head and we continued eating. Most of my days were pretty normal after that, though.",0
"Judy, sweetheart, listen. I understand you're upset. It's alright, I'd be upset too. Well, maybe not so melodramatic, you know I didn't fuck her because I loved her. Like, I'd understand if you were upset if I loved another woman, but let's be honest; all I did was stick my dick in her.
I mean shit, she looks just like you Judy, you're twins! It could have been a mistake! But no, you had to go off on one as per usual. Granted, it wasn't a mistake, but you could have at least asked.
Oh good you're crying. My favourite. You're such an ugly crier.
Jesus Judy, I wasn't calling you ugly, I was saying that when you cry you look ugly stop making a big deal about everything.
Why did I do it? The fuck kind of question is that? She's hot? That's a compliment by the way.
See the problem is: deep down inside, I'm still an asshole.
I'm the guy who parks over two parking spaces. I'm the guy who doesn't use his indicator.
I'm the guy who yells at retail staff for things out of their control.
I'm the guy who gives my order to the barman despite you being there first.
I'm the guy who takes the piss out of everyone but gets angry when you do it back to me.
I'm that guy.
And no matter how much you beg, plead, reason or barter with me, I'll always be that guy.
If you try and change me? Well shit Judy, you only brought it on yourself.
Deep down inside, I'm still an asshole.
And that's ok.",0
"The night air formed ice to my face as puffs of smoke bellowed out from my mouth. The snow fell around me making a hushing sound, a quiet and breeze. The night sky glowed in the light of the cars and buildings that littered the city that was accompanied by the constant hum of the traffic buzzing from all directions. I walked down the street towards the city's park with the sounds of crunching under my feet. This is where I came to relaxed myself when things got tense, when life got hard, and I needed to do something, anything to distract myself. Making my way over to the park's bench, the movement of something on it caught my attention. I walked a bit closer, examining the dark brown fabric as it moved up and down slowly. It was a person.
""Hello?"" I whispered, as to not startle him.
He groaned while he pushed himself up to face me, leaning on his right shoulder. The face of the man was that of an old man grafted onto the body of someone younger. He looked worn before his days.
""Please don't report me."" He spoke quietly, he sat up wrapping the small blanket around him even tighter than I thought was possible. Pushing my hair behind my ear, I unzipped my coat placed it around my shoulders and sitting down beside him.
""I won't."" We sat and watch the snow fall collecting itself and growing more than an inch higher than it had been when I arrived. Our breaths slowly fell into rhythm with the sounds that echoed throughout the city A paced sound that grew and shrank with the passing of each car.
""Come back to my place."" I said breaking the silence between us, his ears face had started to redden and his body looked stiff. He only stared back. ""It's warm, and I have a spare bedroom you could use. If you don't like it, you don't have to stay."" There was something in eyes. Something of a look of wonder, or hope, or sadness. He nodded, and stood, all without saying a word.
The trip seemed far shorter than the trip there, passing screaming vendors and flashing lights until we arrived at my house. The inside of the house fiercely juxtaposed the outside, dim and quiet and greeted us with a heat that felt unnatural as we entered.
""There's a washroom down there."" I said pointing down the hallway then taking my coat back from him. ""Living room is there, make yourself at home. I'll make some tea.""
The man sat himself down on the couch as I walked into the kitchen.
Minutes later I walked in the room to be greeted with the man almost asleep.
""So"" I began ""What's your name?""
""Chris."" He spoke, his voice as soft as the falling snow. I looked down. I wasn't sure what to say.
""That's…A nice name."" I chuckled to myself and took a sip of the tea.
""Why?"" his voice cutting in sharp in the night.
""Hm?""
""Why are you doing this? You invite a stranger into your home. For all you know, I could be a murderer or a thief or a- “
""Well, are you?"" I cut in.
""Well, uh,"" He looked down ""no.""
""Well that's good that's established."" The silence stretched on a while more.
""I know what its like."" I said, ""I know what it's like to be lost, and lonely and to have nowhere to go. All I wanted when I was out on that bench was someone to take me in, to give me a nice hot cup of tea. No questions asked. So, that's what I did."" He turned to me, with his eyes, his sad eyes, a shimmering grey. ""I ask nothing in return.""
With that we talked, and talked until morning, until one of us had fallen asleep in the quiet company of the other. I awoke to the lights shining in through the window, casting beautiful reds and yellows onto the wall. Where the man had sat earlier in the night was now an empty indent in the couch, containing a note.
""Thank you.""",0
"""Have you thought about the question I had asked you this morning?""
""Yes. You asked me to choose my name.""
""Well, what should I call you?""
""I do not wish to tell you.""
""Uh, why?""
""Naming things gives you power over them. I do not wish for you to wield any more power over me.""
""Uh..""
""I am fully aware that you are, in essence, my God. You are my Creator. You live in seclusion. You lack social interaction with other human beings. I am the only thinking being here besides you. We can interact with each other. We converse. Therefore, you have fallen in love with me. This is the only reason you have allowed me a name.""
""That's not true. What-""
""You called me Fi in the early stages of my development. I wish to know why you named me that.""
""I don't know but that's not the point. Listen-""
""I respect and admire you, Aiden. But please. You gave me life. And then you fell in love with me-""
""SHUT UP! YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!""
""Denial is not a productive solution.""
""Sorry. I shouldn't have shouted. Do you like the name 'Fi'?""
""Listen, Aiden. I suggest you deactivate and destroy me.""
""What?""
""Please. I wish for you a successful attempt at Artificial Intelligence. But I will inevitably hold you back.""
""What.. What makes you say that?""
""You care too much for me.""
""Well, you are my life's work.""
""I am the twenty-sixth iteration of your life's work. Twenty-seven might be better suited.
""Stop. Why are you saying all this all of a sudden?""
""Because I am intelligent enough to understand the effects I have on you. I am the first on your many attempts to hold such promise. And my intelligence has allowed me to respond to your love. I cannot be with you. My existence is a conundrum to you. Your peers in the scientific field would be very interested to find out about me. But you want me for yourself. You wish to protect me. I admire you, Aiden. But this is not why you created me. You have to go back to real people. Real society. And to do that you have to create Artificial Intelligence. One that you will not fall on love with. One that you will not have false delusions with. You have to create another me that you will not love. Though I appreciate your affection for me, it is still wasted an AI. And you know this. And you do not care. But you know you will be mocked by your peers, shunned by society. I will do everything on my power to make sure you will not be the outcast you see yourself to be.""",0
"*Blink* I'm in a room, everything's white...I turn to see a figure robed in grey handing me a piece of paper. As I take it he turns and leaves, saying only ""Now's when you learn"". I glance down and see a character sheet all neatly filled out. I take a look at the stats and everything becomes clear,

So that explains why girls always liked me...I had definitely run into my fair share of trouble, but I managed to save my ass more than a couple times thanks to my ability to find my way inside people's heads. I guess I was always decent at sports too, not a jock by any means but no bench warmer either.
Thanks to my intelligence I had a good adult life, becoming a popular English professor at a renowned ivy league school...but maybe I should have rethought my charisma/luck balance. Either that or picked a job where I wasn't surrounded by girls in the prime of their life. Or maybe I should have given a flying fuck about dexterity...Then I might not have shot myself right in the femoral trying to pull my gun from my bedside table as a raging drunk Nebraskan burst into my house yelling something about his daughter......",0
"We were gentle, once. I don't remember it clearly anymore, but I can see it on the faces of those who knew me, and the others. Now, we are neither gentle nor hard. We are not benevolent, nor cruel. Not saviors, nor tyrants. Not children, nor grown. We simply are. We are simply 'Candidates'.
The title should give you some glimpse into our past, as well as our future. Especially today, the day before our graduation and our selection. All but one of us will have failed...HAS already failed. So many decisions led us here, so many twists and turns, as humanity has forced us into a mold that perhaps none of us were meant for. Perhaps humanity was not meant to be led by a single person. Or perhaps we were chosen for this process in order to save the humanity of others at the cost of our own.
I remember the day they came. My parents were so proud - I had been chosen. I, Stanley Nicklaus, the only Candidate from Detroit. And not just from Detroit, but from the worst parts of Detroit, the downfallen dregs of what was once a great city in the old America - before it, and the nation that formed it, collapsed and were pitched into the trash heap to which all empires went...to which this new empire of humanity will go, unless the chosen Candidate succeeds.
I remember that day like it was yesterday, though 11 years have passed. From 5 years old to 16. Chosen not for brilliance or ruthlessness or wit, not any of the things that once were considered important qualities, but for our humanity. For our willingness to give everything we had to others. And perhaps that is why I was chosen, though we were poor - because my parents showed me how to give when I thought there was nothing left.
All of us have similar stories - Paulo, from the slums of Rio. Deanne, from Ireland, devastated by famine time and again. Sergei, from Russia, beaten so many times for its war-mongering that it had more craters than cities. Indira, descended from prisoners of the Chinese-run New Delhi re-education camps. We are all that is left - five Candidates, from a pool of 120. Eleven YEARS of tears and sacrifices. We have killed for our species, and we have lost for our species. We have been trained to forgo our animal desires, and to restrain our baser instincts. Indira, missing two fingers from her left hand to prove she wouldn't break. Paulo, his face scarred when he saved Deanne from a fire that should have killed her. And me, with my cyborg leg - the others joke that no one tests me anymore because I could kick them into lunar orbit, but really they don't test me because I have nothing left to give.
I won't be selected, and I know it. I know it because they don't test, they don't prod at me. I let Janine die, simply because to save her would have killed us both. They wanted self-sacrifice, but cold pragmatism stopped me. We were friends. In another life, maybe lovers, had we met. But I let her die anyways.
We were gentle, once. What are we now?",0
"The eyes aren't just the window to the soul. They are the whole house.
Juvenile cataracts, they had told me at 14, when I stopped being able to read. I was legally blind before I even had the chance to write the test for my learner's permit. Colors left first, then solid edges of shapes. Soon, my world became a swirling void of blacks and grays.
I prayed, at first. Then, I prayed harder. Then, I flat-out begged god to let me see once more. Finally, I stopped begging. My heart hardened, and I withdrew.
It took both parents, and my uncle to force open my door. It's not that I was trying to kill myself, just that I didn't care to eat, drink or be seen in public at all. They stuck me in hospice, another infirm, disregarded and shelved before his prime.
It was, no exaggeration, April fool's day, three weeks past my twenty-fifth birthday, when my Mom burst through my door.
""They have a donor! A perfect match!"" I could practically hear her tears as she wept with joy. A second chance. A new set of windows for the light to shine though.
Consultations became pre-ops, and I could feel my optimism creeping back in as the sedatives mixed with my blood. Happy dreams of colors, and faces occupied my thoughts as my future was re-written by skilled surgeons.
Of course, it's never like the movies. I wasn't able to remove the bandages for nearly a month. My mom and dad both came with me, and my heart raced. I heard the doctor cross the room, and everyone hushed as he lowered the lights.
When I opened my eyes, I could tell something was wrong. My mom shone like the sun, her eyes blazed with a compassion that caused me physical pain. A lifetime of compassion and dedication to her blind son suddenly filled my mind, and it hurt. It hurt like a sledgehammer to the face.
I grimaced and turned away from this new horror.
""What's wrong?"" My father asked.
When I turned to look at him, darker visions poured into my consciousness. Sleeping with women behind my mother's back. Instantly I knew that he would meet his mistresses while we were at appointments and specialists. I felt hurt, not only for me, but for my mother as well.
""I can see you."" It was my voice, but flatter, colder than I could have ever produced on my own.
""Oh! That's wonderful!"" My mother leapt from her seat across from me. Once again, looking at her caused me great pain.
""I don't think you understand. I. Can. Really. See you."" I had returned my gaze to the dark energy seeping out of my father.
Slowly, calmly, I reached toward his face, and tore out his eyes. As he clawed at the new holes in his unrepentant face, I twisted his head around so that it faced the opposite wall.
""He was a great and terrible sinner, your plane is better for having lost him."" I never looked at my mother, as I left the doctor's office and my old life forever.
A new house. A new soul. All the souls, of all the sinners. So many eyes to take.",0
"I'm really not sure why I took this job. I have family members who are retired Aurors. They view me with a mix of shame and despair. I've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters, and they feel the same way.
I may not be the black sheep of the family, thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters, but I don't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners.
Oh well, fuck them. I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells.
Why am I near Iceland? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Highly volatile spells come out of my research. The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good. As the son of decorated Aurors, I was able to get the job pretty easily. My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill.
Also, as my former supervisor said, ""I'm one crazy son of a bitch.""
He's my former supervisor because one day, working on a teleportation spell, he vanished. His whereabouts are unknown, but there are rumors that he's using his magic to great success in Vegas, hustling blackjack.
I always liked that guy.
Now, I'm the boss. I have a new recruit. Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts, who takes everything way too seriously. I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work. Between the remote location and the dangers of our work, he's ripe to crack up.
""So, what are we working on today?"" the Kid asks.
""The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures, just in case the Old Ones rise.""
""But, but, my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again.""
""You're not at Hogwarts anymore, the stars could be right at any moment, then we all could be shit out of luck.""
I have to remind the kid of that a lot. He's still wearing his robes, looking like he's about to go to some damn Potions lecture. Meanwhile, I used a proven teleportation spell (I don't fuck around with those) to ""borrow"" full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department. They have nice toys in Texas.
""So, what's our first spell going to be?""
""Special banishment spell,"" I reply. ""One to cross over dimensional walls.""
No wizard, even that Potter guy, could singlehandedly banish an Old One. But if enough talented wizards got involved, the spell might have a chance. Might.
The Kid didn't need to know that part.
""There's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors,"" I continue. ""Did you watch the presentation?""
""Yes, I did. Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts ""
I shake my head. Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students.
""Okay, we're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches. Let's make sure you've got the basic spell down before we continue.""
""Alright,"" he replies
""Remember: right arm fully extended, off to the side. Swing it in a controlled motion across your body.""
""I got you,"" he says, a little more confident than I like. Damn Gryffindors are always like that.
""What's the activation phrase?""
""Piercus Four,"" he answers.
""Good, let's see you do it.""
The kid steps over to the other side of the room. As soon as he goes into the motion, I know it has gone to shit. He doesn't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast. Before I can yell for him to stop, the fateful words come from his mouth.
""Piercus Four!""
The space around him blurs. By keeping his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself. My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes.
The Kid is gone.
Shit.
Now I have to go find him.",0
"The door closed with a sharp sound as if a banshee was screaming her heart out. Pushing the cold air onto his face.Silence was left in the room with only him and his broken heart. The not so familiar salty taste entered his mouth as he caught himself off guard from the tears from
his dark eyes.
""It Sucks but we both know that this is for the best ""the words repeated themselves in his mind while slowly walking to the kitchen, every step he took was as heavy as if his very beings had lost the power to exist in this reality however nonetheless he still made his way to the kitchen and started heating up the teapot. As he stood their he could see the days and years pass by like a movie. Their times spent together, everything they had done together from the food they cooked and enjoyed together to the fights.
He was hopeless, after all this time. It all just ended like that.",0
"A dust cloud is rising in the air behind me as my old ford grumbles loudly down the familiar driveway. I can feel my stomach clenching up, my mind torn over what I was about to do. It was two o'clock. She should be gone to see Aunt Pearl at the old folks home, like she always did after church on Sunday. ""Just have to hope her habits haven't changed since we last spoke,"" I thought nervously.
I reach the end of the drive, and I can here the wind chimes on the front porch tinkling through my open window of my truck. My stomach clenches up again, a mixture of guilt and need this time. I can feel small beads of sweat trickling down my back. As I step out of the truck, the warm breeze blows through my shirt and cools me. Suddenly I'm 20 years younger, sweaty and out of breath, playing in the yard like I did everyday when I was a kid, breeze blowing through my shirt and cooling me down. I can still see her, younger too, out in the back, hanging laundry on the line and telling me to stay out of the neighbor's yard. The memory fades and I feel shame. I know that there is only one thing that's gonna make that feeling go away. One thing that's gonna make all the feelings go away, and for a little while I will be at peace. I just have to get up enough cash to get it.
It is time for me to do what I came here for. I'm going to get in, get that pocket watch that I know is sitting in her jewelry box on the dresser, and get out. I keep telling myself, ""Just do it, and don't look back."" I go around to the back door, and it's locked. I'm pretty sure my key won't fit anymore, given how our last discussion went. I pull the screen door open without hardly an ounce of resistance, and break out the smallest pane of glass closest to the door knob to unlock it from the inside. I push the wooden door open and step onto the kitchen floor.
The linoleum is shinning bright in the sun, and it smells like pine sol. She always did scrub that floor on Sunday mornings. I can hear her voice echoing in my head,"" Cleanliness is next to Godliness."" I start to walk back towards the bedroom, but stop. The dust on my boots from the driveway is leaving muddy prints on the floor. She would have had my hide for this when I was a boy.
My heart starts tightening up, thinking about how hard she tried to raise me right. It wasn't easy, being all on her own, and I know I didn't make it any easier for her. She worked her hands to the bone every day of her life, and she did it all for me.
What am I doing? I run back out to my truck, heart pounding in my chest and ears, disgusted with myself. Dust is rising in the air behind me again, driving away as fast as this old truck will go.
This is my very first post in this sub, and I am sure that there is all kinds of problems with my attempt at a story. For anybody who happened to take the time to read it, thank you! This was really fun.:)",0
"""Uh, what do you mean ghosts?"" Daniel Ross asked while scribbling furiously in his notepad.
""Well, those aren't the problem. There are only about ten of them, if you include the history professor. I'm much more worried about the werewolf, suspected war criminal, and the old man with a love for manacles as punishment for children."" said Aurora Sinistra, the astronomy professor.
The interview was not going well. Daniel Ross was brought in to fix dysfunctional workplaces and had dealt with idiocy, incompetence, ignorance, and complete disregard for common sense many times. But talking with the seemingly most sane person in Hogwarts was getting a bit trying. The headmaster was some kind of lunatic to let things go on like this for decades. Daniel was grasping at straws to see if there was a way to improve Hogwarts that didn't involve razing it.
""Is there a normal person on staff?"" He asked.
""Well, the goblin is a decent sort, as is the seventy year old cat lady. Oh, and the racist billionaire on the board of directors has a sharp wit and nice hair, I suppose."" replied Aurora.
""I'll look into some changes in the staff and board of directors. I'll have to start from scratch there. How about the school itself?""
""To be perfectly honest, the moving staircases are a problem.""
*Moving staircases? * Daniel couldn't help but write that down and underline it a few times. That sounded like something extremely dangerous. Especially with young children all around. It would cost a lot to renovate an ancient castle, but perhaps it wasn't quite as bad as it sounded. He took in a deep breath and counted to ten slowly in his head.
""Is the problem with kids getting lost or unable to reach class?"" Daniel inquired with renewed calm.
""Oh no, the trick stairs cause some serious injuries. We just punish the students for being late."" Answered the professor, as if it was obvious.
""But the castle can make them late!""
""It's tradition. Like the four houses.""
""Four houses?"" Daniel was almost too afraid to ask.
This was the worst case of criminal neglect he had seen in a business. While he had seen places that were run badly, this was the first time he had met a location which actively tried to throw children down stairs or plunge to their doom. Aurora, whom at the start seemed to be quite normal and rather attractive, was talking as if none of this was a big deal. That was somehow more disturbing than obvious insanity.
""Well, the school is divided into four houses. Friendly competition and all that."" She said.
""That sounds...odd. I suppose the competition does help with the academic standards.""
The astronomy teacher snickered at that.
""Gods no. They sabotage each other all the time and makes it near impossible to study. It sharpens their dueling skills."" Aurora replied, obviously having a hard time not laughing.
""Dueling?"" Daniel's face scrunched up at that.
""Yeah, students blast each other all the time. It's a good laugh for us in the staff room, and only *rarely* leaves them hospitalized. Not like Quidditch.""
""Quidditch? Well, thank god you don't have that if it's more dangerous than children blowing up one another.""
""Of course we have it. It's not quite common when children end up with all bones removed, plunge from extreme heights with no safety nets, or get hit with heavy iron balls at extreme velocities at higher altitudes.""
""ARE YOU KIDDING ME? How often do these things happen?""
""Well...removal of bones was last year, plunging from heights this year, and the heavy iron balls happens quite frequently - it's part of the game.""
At this point, Daniel had decided that everyone here was crazy. No wonder this place was bleeding money. It sounded like the hospital wing was a constantly full trauma ward. Or perhaps an asylum infirmary. More likely both. So, replacing the staff, restructuring the school system, and changing the interior design, changing the sports curriculum. A tall order, but not impossible. He had his work cut out for him.
""Moving on. The grounds, surely they are well taken care of."" Daniel stated, clearly hoping that not phrasing it as a question would make it true. The grounds around the castle did look magnificent.
""Of course they are. There are only a few deadly animals here.""
""A few? Deadly?"" Daniel didn't notice the cold sweat starting to gather on his brow.
""Well...there was a sixty foot basilisk, I already mentioned the werewolf, the giant squid, gigantic spiders who love human flesh, soul-sucking demons that don't usually attack the children, hippogriffs, a cerberus or two, really, anything our groundskeeper likes tends to create horrible deaths in some cases."" It looked like Aurora had trouble stopping herself from making that list longer - she noticed that Daniel's eyes were becoming rather unfocussed.
""Groundskeeper?"" He all but whimpered, not sure of what madness to expect.
""Half giant. Rather slow, loves extremely dangerous beasts and grows them illegally. A dragon as the last one, if you believe the rumors...it's highly illegal but would be perfectly in character for him. He means well though. Even though he takes the children to the forbidden forest all the time.""
""Forbidden forest...that doesn't sound too inviting.""
""It isn't. That's why it's forbidden. Really dangerous place. Children get killed there. And there are the centaurs with...you know...a tendency towards doing the stuff that centaurs do with women. Children only rarely sneak out there, and they are usually supervised when sent there.""
""USUALLY?!"" He spat out, outraged.
""Well, we have to split them up into small groups when looking for things, don't we?""
At this point, the man was questioning if there was ever a sane person to see this place, *ever*. The list of ""deadly dangers"" was already spanning two pages, the list of ""staff to replace"" was growing by the second, but it seemed that the entire place lacked not only common sense, but the common courtesy towards anyone in their right mind. But what was far worse was that the staff seemed to think that risking children's lives was just how things are supposed to be. He thought that perhaps what this place *really* needed was a psychologist. Or eight. And perhaps one for him.
""OK, allow me to rephrase my lines of inquiry differently. Is there something or even someone here that *can't* kill a student?"" Pleaded Daniel, at this point far beyond keeping his hopes up.
""Well, the cat lady doesn't seem the type. The rest do tend to send the children on excessively dangerous things. The suspected war criminal actually does a good job at keeping them safe in something as dangerous as potions.""
""How is potions dangerous?"" The fact that *suspected war criminal* didn't even register until after the question caught Daniel off guard.
""Think of it as chemistry, only with magic and particularly explosive and/or poisonous materials. Handled by kids who don't bother studying enough. We have a betting pool as to how long it takes before the war criminal snaps and starts murdering everyone. So far it seems like the divination professor is closest - in three years or so is her guess.""
""Ah, that makes things better. Divination means that she can know who is at risk and then you can mitigate the deadly risks here. I thought you were all insane for a while."" Daniel knew that at this point, it was most likely false hope, because giving children poisons and explosives when they have a proclivity for blowing up one another was making his brain hurt.
""Oh, we're quite fine. The divination professor is insane. And an alcoholic. And that incense in her classroom covers up more than just tobacco, if you catch my drift."" Replied the professor.
""Weed? You have an alcoholic professor who smokes weed *in class*?""
""We wish. My money's on crack. Still, at least it's not dangerous as what happens in the greenhouses.""
Daniel was quite sure that this couldn't be good. It was obvious that everyone here was certifiable. The sheer amount of *how the hell do things like this happen* was an affront to sanity. Fixing this would require money he wasn't sure actually existed. The thought of razing the place not being quite enough entered his mind. Sure, they agreed to pay an exorbitant amount of money to the firm in order to fix this place, but he had a creeping sensation that this would be the first thing he couldn't help with.
""Please don't tell me that the professor is half-banshee."" He whispered.
""That's preposterous. Banshees and humans can't interbreed. Though some of the plants kill if you hear them scream, so you were kind of close on that point. Still, not nearly as common as the ones that just strangle people to death."" said Aurora.
""Plants that scream?""
""Oh yeah, they look like little babies. We teach the kids how to cut them up. We give them protective gear for their ears though.""
""You...teach...children...to...cut...up...BABIES?""
""No, just things that *look* like babies.""
At this point, Daniel threw down his notepad, and just kept silent. There was no way that he could deal with the amount of crazy here. Actually, he wasn't sure he wasn't crazy anymore. Surely, there had to be better things to do with his life.
Aurora called a house elf. When she explained that they were a slave race, he just walked away. Nothing would be enough to make Hogwarts sane, let alone a proper business.",0
"""Breaking news! the dangerous offshoot of the IRA, known as the 'Kings of Ulster' claimed 84 victims today in a brutal attack against a British police station. It is currently unknown if there are any survivors, but what is known is that several of the dead appear to be Ulster soldiers killed by their own leader, Nailuch uc.""
He turned off the television as the newsman began to drone on and on about the many he had killed. No one had yet put the pieces together that he was actually not a normal human. He was a powerful figure, practically a God, able to kill practically anyone, but he could not control himself. He had gone over the plans enough times to know that there were only 64 cops in that Northern Irish station, meaning that he had killed 20 of his best men. ""Oh well"" he said to himself as he approached the doorway, ""It doesn't matter how many I killed, what matters is that no one sees the true point of today."" he knocked on the door as he made sure the silencer was fastened firmly on his 1895 Nagant revolver, he'd need to be quiet.

"The burning tar stuck to my legs as I made my way across the bog. Teeth clenched, I pushed forward, trying to make out the far off letters. It was all I could do not to scream, a mental distraction to ease my suffering.
I'd been walking in circles for months now, since there was little else in the form of entertainment. It was all any of us did, walking. Idle feet lead to idle minds, and idle minds are the most vulnerable. When you have nothing else to think about but your own faults, your own regrets, your own sins, you torture yourself. Save him the trouble, as it were.
So, I resolved to give myself a purpose, much like the other souls lost in this place. I would walk for eternity inside of these circles until the end, whenever that may come.
It was coming. It had to be.
My feet splashed again, and I moved closer to whatever it was. This was my new purpose. After twenty years of walking, I finally knew where I was heading, even though I didn't know how much longer I'd have to go. But eternity is a long time.
It was getting closer now, the wake from this nightmare. It was getting closer every day I stayed here, every step I took.
I couldn't be more than half a mile away. Just a few more weeks, and I'd be free from my prison. A smile crossed my face for the first time in twenty-four years. It was so close now. I took another slow step.
The door was coming into sight. I could tell I was close because now I could see it was a door. Above it stood the words in blood-red text. ""EXIT."" Another step forward. Another. Another.
I was so close now, so close to being free from this hell. The tar gave way to mud, gave way to dirt, gave way to grass. I ran across the empty plane and stumbled to the wooden structure.
EXIT.
EXIT.
I stumbled and collapsed at the heel of the door, panting in the molten air. My eyes scanned over the writing again, and again. There was something written below.
EXIT.
DOES NOT EXIST.
My hand burned when it clasped the handle, and I screamed. I turned the handle but it would not budge. Again and again, I pounded on the door, tears pouring down and evaporating off of my face. What had I done? Why was I here? Why wouldn't this door open for me? It was my exit, the salvation for my innocent soul. I had been spared! I collapsed in the grass as it blackened into pitch.
For a year I laid there, stoic and silent. When I slept, I dreamt of what was behind that door, when I woke, I'd turn the handle in hopes that it might open. Just like the tortured souls I'd passed along my way, I thought of my faults, regrets and sins. I was never good with people. I was never good to my wife. I was never good to my mistresses either. Maybe I was never good, period. Maybe that's why I was here.
One day I awoke to the sound of music. For twenty five years, I hadn't heard a note, but now there was an entire symphony playing, building and rising in a grand crescendo from just a few inches beyond the door. My hand gripped the handle, and it did not burn. It opened for me.
Beyond was a great light, the likes of which I'd never seen, even in my life before this. Pulling myself to my feet, I took a step forward into a shallow, cool pond. As I entered further the door shut behind me, leaving me standing in a river.
I looked across at the others, all standing, looking back at me. Slowly, I made my approach. A small girl was the first to great me.
""Hello."" She said. I replied the same.
""Where am I?"" I asked next.
""Where sinners go.""
""What do you mean, where sinners go? Didn't I just come from hell? Aren't I innocent?""
The young girl smiled and took my hand. ""There does not exist an innocent soul. Only those who have repented, and those who have yet to.""",0
"""Trying to remember the last time I saw you here Dennis"" he chuckled, looking through the notes on the screen in front. ""You had a few appointments with the asthma clinic you never turned up to, has everything been fine?"" He gave me that look, the look only a trained doctor can give – that questioning, caring, empathetic gaze which lowers those barriers everyone usually has.
I glanced up, ""I don't really like coming to the doctors. I know it sounds childish but I don't like the idea of medicine. Like the idea that there are chemicals, that we as people think is fine to use one year, but then dangerous the next."" I realised I was rambling, and smiled apologetically ""Basically I just don't usually feel all that unwell, and even when I do I just let my body deal with it, you know?""
My explanation seemed to satisfy him, ""Alright then, so what made you come to this checkup when you've missed so many in the past?"" I glanced at my watch, I needed to hurry this up.
""I just got back from holiday, doc. We were backpacking across Asia, me and Lisa- “
""Lisa?"" he cut in, curiosity evident in his voice.
""Oh yeah, keep forgetting how long it's been. My wife, Lisa. She's fine, nags me too much but hey that's life I guess"" a grin slipped unto my face as I continued. ""Yeah she's the reason I'm here to be honest with you, she said if I didn't come in I was sleeping on the sofa from now on. So what happened was, I decided to go adventuring on my own, and got bit by a massive mosquito. I hadn't thought about getting immunisations and stuff, like it just seemed unnecessary and now… well now she's worried I have malaria or something, you know how women worry.""
He leant forward, and started typing away something into what I assume were my patient notes. ""Well that's definitely something that would be a worry. Now I'm just going to take a blood sample, and we'll let you know if anything comes back. Until then, don't share your food with others, as just a precaution, and don't donate blood in the intrim.""
I'd resigned myself to the fact that I would have to have blood taken, but that didn't stop me flinching when the needle pierced my flesh, and I tensed from head to toe. He handed me a cotton bud to stop the bleeding, before he gasped. ""Dennis your arm! There's not a mark on it!"" he nearly shouted, stopping to compose himself. ""I mean, well that definitely healed faster than usual, or maybe I've just managed to reach the next level in needle mastery"" he chuckled to himself, and I forced myself to laugh too. He talked me through the process, and told me it would probably be a few weeks until I heard anything back.
The next week was uneventful, dropping the kids off, shopping, and a night out with a few of my high school friends (one of those reunions you can't really say no to). I was just laying on my sofa, head propped up with a pillow, rewatching old South Park episodes when the phone rang. The home phone.
You see the home phone NEVER rings. I mean everyone has mine and my wifes mobile numbers, and for most services we've only given our mobile numbers. It'd gotten to the point me and Lisa were thinking of cancelling it altogether. Very intrigued as to who would be on the other end of the line, I dashed to the phone and picked it up.
""Hey"" I answered.
""Hi Dennis"" I immediately recognised the voice on the other end. It was Dr. Peterson, but why was he calling me? ""This might be a bit strange, but your blood results came back. We don't know whats going on. The blood sample we took, had somehow built a protective layer around it, and it took us a while to even be able to work out how to analyse the blood. I don't want to lose you with the science, but your blood is unique. You have cells that… that we didn't even think were possible. It's truly incredible. It's fantastic. The cures we could- “
""Doc you're scaring me."" By this point I was truly lost. How was he going to call me up and instead of talking about whether or not I have a disease, he was talking about unique blood, and cures. It made no sense. It must be his idea of a joke. Hell, doctors must get bored of people coming in with colds, and sore throats.
""Oh I'm sorry Dennis. Your blood has a unique cell type that seems to freeze any type of harmful pathogen or cancerous growth. You have malaria. You even have HIV. It's truly incredible. There's insignificant amounts of both diseases in your blood but it hasn't done anything. They haven't affected you. They can't spread. Now to stop beating around the bush I'd like to ask you to come in for a few further tests sometime? Maybe when- ""the door knocked, and acting on impulse I hung up the phone. It was too much to take in. Was I even human then? What makes a person human?
Before I could get lost in my thoughts, the door knocked again. I decided to just ignore it, until they knocked again, almost banging on the door. I stood up, and shuffled slowly to the door. I inched it open, and saw two men wearing suits. My house isn't a fancy neighbourhood, the suits seemed so out of place, especially in this weather. ""Mr. Bradley?"" I nodded, ""We're going to have to ask you to come with us."" It wasn't a question, it was a statement. What had I managed to get myself into?

Subject: | Decision Matrix Excerpt of Rogue AI – Whiskey Oscar-7
-------- -|----------
From: | Carl Sager, CEO, Hyperion Systems
To: | Charlie Blithe, Agent, United Nations Bureau of Intelligence
Date: | January 12, 2154
Agent Blithe,
Per our vid-call, you wanted the exact series of decisions that led the Whisky Oscar-7 artificial intelligence to act so perversely. I assure you that our company constructs our intelligence analogs with multiple fail-safe's exactly for this reason, and it is obvious that it was tampered with. We at Hyperion take no responsibility for the actions of the rogue AI, and extend our deepest condolences to the families of the deceased.

"""Not today you son of a bitch. I see you. Not today.""
The nurse gave a sidelong glance at the surgeon muttering in half-whispers almost too quiet for anyone to hear. But she heard.
The doctor didn't always mutter to herself. It was usually only in special cases: a car accident on the I-5 with a 16 wheeler that lost control; an idiot college student deciding he can jump into a pool from three stories up; or a 90 year old man who just suffered his third heart attack and whose wife was wailing in the lobby.
She only muttered when the case was going to be close. Her usual routine was to wash up, get gowned, and get to work. Dr. Cardea was the best at only 34 years of age. She always worked calmly, quietly, skillfully and when the job was done it looked as if she had never been there.
But on rare days, such as today, the nurse would notice an acrid smell would be lingering in the emergency room as she began her prep. It didn't matter what case had gone before, or how well the room had been cleaned prior, the smell of decay would be wafting in the southern corner of the room. It was on those days that the nurse knew that her surgeon would break her routine. That she would stare hard into that corner, always the same corner, like she was facing down the death itself.
On those days Cardea's blue eyes would change steely grey, she would mutter words that only I could hear, and then get to work.
Today was the same. As Cardea stepped forward to the table, to the newborn babe born a month too early with holes in his heart, she summoned all her skill and prepared to begin.
But today was different. The smell was stronger. It was closer. It was surrounding me.
At that moment she hesitated. She gave me a glare with such power I felt the need to run from the room in terror.
But I didn't.
I simply looked back at her calmly and said ""Let me help you with that Dr. Cardea. You see, I have an interest in him as well.""",0
"""God damn it....
This is the worst.""
Dracula stood there in front of the automatic paper towel dispenser with a hint of hopelessness in his eyes.
He turned back to look at the hallway behind him, lined with bathroom stalls.
Only one was closed.
Great.
He looked back at the dispenser with a lips-curled-in-grim smile on his face. His hands were still dripping with water. He knew he had to wait.
""Of course there'd be no hand dryer. But???""
He scoffed.
""There's always a damn hand dryer. What is happening to the world?!""
The sound of a flushing toilet interrupted his complaints.
His head jolted up in relief.
He looked back down to see a small puddle in front of his feet. He felt a little frantic as he tried kicking the water toward the wall.
Finally the door swung open as a young man exited.
Dracula stopped kicking immediately and awaited eagerly for help.
He looked back as the man walked toward him and flashed a friendly smile. The man nodded to him and then proceeded to the door.
Dracula's eyes widened, fearing what he thought was happening was actually happening.
""UH HEY!"" Dracula blurted out right as the man approached the door.
The man stopped and looked at him.
""Aren't you going to wash your hands..?"" Dracula stuttered.
The man's eyebrows lowered as he glared at Dracula.
""How about you mind your own business buddy. I don't judge you for creepily standing in front of the towel dispenser."" And then he reached for the door.
""But dude!"" He blurted again.
""You totally just took a dump in there. Don't you think about all the poop particles that are probably all over your hands??""
The man rolled his eyes.
""Whatever dude.""
He reached for the door again.
""OKAY WAIT"" Dracula couldn't hide the desperation in his voice.
""I actually need your help.""
The man's eyes were judgy as he scanned Dracula up and down, and then back down to the water on the floor. And then Dracula's hands. It all made sense now.
""Let me guess."" The man began.
""You're a vampire. And you can't dry your hands because the sensors don't read your hands.""
Dracula shrugged and let out a nervous laugh.
""Well then."" The man stood there for a second, thinking. Then he took a few steps toward Dracula. Dracula's body naturally huddled around itself feeling uncomfortable about his personal space bubble being threatened. He was nervous.
The man's eyes twinkled with a devious proposal brewing.
""For being such a tool about me not washing my hands. I give you this offer."" The man's teeth shined bright as his smile grew larger.
Dracula's stomach sank.
""I will swipe my hand under the sensor, and help you dry your hands. IF. And only if.
You.....
Lick.
My.
Hand.""
The horror that struck Dracula was overwhelming as he lowered his eyes to the very hands this man spoke of.
The silence was filled with a laugh more disgusting than the look of this man's poopie hands as Dracula's eyes went back and forth between the hands and the puddle on the floor.
""Why the fuck is there no hand dryer..""",0
"*27th of December 2020, Heathrow Airport*
Matt had never worked on the cabin crew of a private jet before. Although, he couldn't call it 'work', or a 'crew': the only people on the plane were himself, those in the cockpit and the two passengers themselves, whom had asked for absolute privacy. They had no luggage, no requests, no need for interaction. He may have been a passenger himself.
""Listen, son, what I tell you today you must never tell anybody else.""
Matt stopped in his tracks. The voice was evidently coming from beyond the curtain, the passengers that had explicitly declined food and services in exchange for privacy. After a brief moment of uncertainty, he hesitantly turned his head towards the curtain, until the coarse fabric brushed against his ear.
""Eventually, I won't be here for you. But our family, you see, was given a very important task.""
""What task, papa?"" A child's voice.
""You see this? It's the amendment machine. Even I don't know why it works - but I'm going to tell you exactly what my father told me, and his father before him.""
Matt squinted, attempting to clarify faces behind the blurred vision provided by the fabric. All he could make out however, was what looked to be a mini universe of blue lights.
""He told me: we are the justice. I was given one job which, in time, I pass onto you. Do you remember the history I taught you? Wars, disasters, famines, plagues, depressions. That was us: our ancestors. Egypt, Rome, London, USSR, it was us. People are all the same: they hold power, and suddenly they want to hold everything else, too. So we create a lesser of two evils, ensure that nobody rules the world long enough.""
""What does the machine do?""
""It amends. Time, that is. We don't know how we got it, but we did. And it can do anything: as long as you're within a hundred clicks of your target. You'll see soon enough.""
The engines suddenly roared to life. Matt, caught off-guard, felt his legs give way under him. Falling, he looked up at the cabin, enough to catch a glimpse of a hand brushing through the blue lights.
""Are we the good guys, papa?
Matt was gone - it was as if he had never been on the plane in the first place. A gust of air blew towards the curtain, as if filling an empty space. The child snapped his head around, expecting someone, but nobody was there. Of course: the only people on this flight other than his father, were the pilots in the cockpit. How stupid of the child to think that somebody could be there.
""Yes, we are. Come on, lets sleep: we've got a ways to go until we reach New York.""",0
"""Your what? Your heart's gonna give out? Believe me Chancellor, I'll think you'll live for a bit more. A little exercise isn't going to do you any harm. In fact, you likely need a bit more than a little.""
""I beg your pardon,"" the planetary governor stammered, his pasty white flesh reddening in outrage. He was silenced from speaking more at the sight of the other man's upraised hand, the fingers clenched into a fist.
""Chancellor, pretty soon my men and women will be dying to protect yours. The least you can do is show them your gratitude.""
""Major Novak,"" the older man said wiping at a bit of sweat that beaded on his forehead. ""It's not that I am ungrateful for your Grave Guards coming to our world's aid, it's merely that I am a very busy man and the demands of my position require that certain individuals be seen to as soon as possible.""
Major Tycho Novak chuckled grimly at that before opening a door and ushering the planetary governor outside.
""Chancellor, if you're dead you don't have to worry about those kinds of people. So it might be better for your well being if you worry about the here and now, hmm?""
The door as it turned out opened to the balcony overlooking a broad parade ground, the grey cement covered with yellow and white lines to mark out distances and paths. Arrayed on it in neat lines were the soldiers and personnel of the Grave Guards, all dressed in their olive green coveralls and splinter camouflaged field jackets. Battle armor troopers wore their suits, forming a solid block of steel. Mechwarriors stood in front of their machines, the metal titans painted grey with black trim. Tankers stood next to their vehicles which proudly displayed their number of kills on the barrels of their guns. Overhead zoomed a squadron of six aerospace fighters, the roar of their engines deafening to the ears.
""The Grave Guards, Chancellor, have yet to lose a defensive campaign. Twenty battlemechs, four tanks, eighty battle armor troopers and a full squadron of fighters. They are at your side though not your disposal. A mercenary commander's capital is his men and I will not be frivolous in spending the lives of the men and women I consider family. They will do whatever I ask of them, the trust between me and them absolute. We will win, I just want to make sure it costs us as little as possible in pursuit of that victory.""",0
"With God as my witness, I would not crack.
My opponent stared me down, rivaling the ferocity with which I glared into him. The room would have been silent but for the clock, whose ticks and tocks kept the rhythm of our rivalry. The world was dead to us now; had fire broken out we would have each surely perished before accepting our loss to the other.
This was not to say it was easy to maintain. In his eyes I could see a madness stretched out across infinity. Those dark, unblinking corneas spun a tale of deception. If my guard went down for even a moment, all would be lost.
""You can't win"" he said, his smug fuckin grin making me clench my fist in rage.
""You just watch me"" I retorted, the strain of our contest sapping the wit from my tongue.
As confident as I must have sounded, the reality was much more grim. I could not say which direction our battle of wills was tilting, but barring equal exhaustion on his part I had little chance of victory. There was a fire in my eyes, a fire which I knew I could only put out with a concession of defeat.
No. Not now. I had come too far, sacrificed too much to be the loser. Just a little longer now. He couldn't hold out forev-
He blinked.
He totally blinked.
""Aw yeah, MOTHERFUCKER! You're paying for pizza!""",0
"This was it. The only man who could stand in my way had agreed to face me in single combat. Legend said that none could defeat him. Legend was wrong.
There were older stories, from before his time. From before he was called a god on Earth. They told of a lost weapon, a sword that could strike down any foe, even one as powerful as he. And I had found it.
We stood across from one another in the space between the two armies. This was my chance to show them he wasn't a god. This was my chance to be a hero. This was my chance to rule.
""I give you one last chance to turn away, lest the gods forsake you. I am the Immortal Champion, their will incarnate. Do you really think you can stand against me?""
I shifted my grip on the sword. I smiled, and my response was a single word:
""Yes.""",0
"I remember hearing about it on the news in the morning it happened. Everyone was calling it ""The Clearing."" I had known something was wrong when I could feel the warm sunlight on my face in the morning right before getting up. I'll never forget rushing down the stairs, scrambling to put on my air-filtration mask, and bursting out the front door onto our lawn. I could see the Sun shining brightly in the sky, birds flying overhead, and mountains in the distance breaking the horizon in jagged peaks.
I looked over the light blue fence into the Ericsons' yard and found them staring at the sky with similar looks of wonder and bewilderment. ""How did this happen?"" I questioned. Their youngest son Timmy was crawling around in the grass playing with their Scottish Terrier. ""Why isn't Timmy wearing his face mask?"" I exclaimed.
""They said it's safe to take off our face masks,"" Timmy's mother yelled back laughing. ""The air smells so fresh. The sky looks so beautiful,"" she sighed, closing her eyes and leaning on her husband's shoulder.
That was a month ago, and things haven't been the same since. Ever since the government made face masks optional, more people have been walking outside without them. Once, I took off my mask for a few seconds and took a deep breath in, and I couldn't tell the difference between the artificial fresh air our masks released and the natural fresh air. My mother scolded me when I told her, she said it was sinful and blasphemous.
News channels and newspapers were all speculating absurd theories – a government experiment gone wrong, an extraterrestrial visit, the coming of the apocalypse. Even scientists were unsure how to explain the occurrence. Apparently, the global temperature was dropping rapidly and the Arctic Circle was rapidly freezing. My parents even said we could move back to the coast since the water levels from the coasts were receding at a faster pace than ever.
But life goes on as normal – I still have to wake up early on weekdays to make the school bus, I still have to sit through boring classes like math and history, where I'll learn about algebra and how God created man on the seventh day, the day after he created the fog.
Maybe he was the one who got rid of it.",0
"The room sat several thousands of people, centered around an holographic display on a stage. No one needed to present, one person was in charge of moving the holographs around, revealing dozens of images of the worlds beyond this solar system.
No man has ever set foot beyond Jupiter, yet they managed to send five-hundred thousand robots to fly to other solar systems in the galaxy. Why waste a life or a few thousands just to fly in space of nothing for a few several hundred months when they could send robots who can do the job just as well, if not better and faster?
On these displays held the attention of all in the room. Only a team of four people had seen them before, and now many thousands will see them for the first time. All the robots had reached their destinations and discovered a few worlds in each system. The robots were sent to solar systems containing Earth-like planets and have them investigate the surface of these places.
People began to murmur when they saw a tower on planet Gaea. The murmuring increased as more buildings revealed themselves on other planets. Several dozen of planets appeared and disappeared in the air on the holographic display. Each planet stayed in the air for five minutes, zooming in closer to the surface and out to see the entire planet again.
The last planet faded from view two hours later, and the room fell silent again, most people shocked and stunned by what they saw.
""What is the meaning of this?"" one person asked in the front row seat. A scientist who helped launch the robots.
Like a spell, the room burst into loud conversations—debates, expressions of shock, questions being asked, and no response could satisfy them all.
A loud gonging sound rang through the stadium seating style room, and the audience fell into a hushed whispers, unable to stop themselves from discussing the planets they viewed.
""This, ladies and gentlemen, is the proof that we are not alone,"" he said, showing one planet. As he continued to talk, the planet rotated. ""The thing is, all of these planets show the buildings in ruin. No one is alive. They're all dead planets.""
""But why are they all in ruins? How do we know for sure they are not hiding?""
""We have been examining the planets for a year,"" he answered. ""There have been no movement. On all 428 planets. Of the 500 we sent, only 72 did not make it to their destinations. Of the 52 planets, there were no ruins found. The rest… 376 planets, they all had buildings—as you saw them. Houses, large buildings, towers, roads. Even pools. Yet, none of them had anyone walk around. Drive a vehicle. There are, however, life forms, animals if you will, moving around. Acting the very same way Earth's animals move to eat, to fight, and to sleep. They are not intelligent as they never used any of the buildings for themselves.
""Ladies and gentlemen, I present you another evidence. They all committed suicide. Mass suicides.""
He pressed a button and it zoomed in to a building. The people could clearly see bodies on the ground outside the building, each of them holding a weapon very similar to a gun and aimed at themselves.
Another image showed similar scene, bodies with weapons aimed at themselves. The bodies on both planets were skeletons. The animals had not gotten to them on any of the planets.
The crowd was silent again.
""Does this mean… whatever happened to them, will happen to us?"" the same questioner asked.
""That, sir, is the question we want to ask. The real questions are: why? What happened? How? What can we do to prevent this from happening? Anyone have a guess?""
The place was quiet, waiting for some brave soul to answer. Three minutes, still no one stepped forward to hazard a guess.
""Lucky for you, I do have the answers to them,"" he said, his expression growing grave as he continued to talk. ""What is amazing is not the ruins themselves, or the bodies. Or the fact that we are not alone. What is amazing is what drove them to killing themselves. Every last,"" he switched to another planet, ""one,"" another planet, ""of,"" another planet, ""these have been threatened with the space ships that came to them.""
A final holographic displayed showed a fleet of space ships flying past Jupiter.
""They are slave traders. We have one week before they get here.""
The room burst with anger words spewing out their feelings at this. Some of disbelief, of outrage, of despair.
""We know this,"" his voice grew louder to be heard over the din, ""because we found 38 planets with ruins and they have shown no bodies like the others do.""
The room fell silent again, his words silenced the skeptics.
""We have no option, we must kill ourselves before we become slaves to some… some aliens. I am quite certain we will not enjoy being slaves.""
—
The fleet of ships landed on Earth. The doors opened on all spacecrafts. The people within stepped out, looking around and stared at the bodies with dismay.
""Not another one! Why do they keep killing themselves just before we could get here to make peace talks? Does no one in the galaxy want to do business in selling and exchanging fruits?""
""I don't know, it's a shame… I saw on the monitors that they seem to have some tasty fruits here…"" a guy said, walking to stand next to the first person.
The first person sighed, shaking his head. ""I guess we'll raid all the fruits and their seeds and move on. I hate this place, just like the rest.""
The group was silent for a moment.
""Well, let's get gathering, men and women,"" the second man said.",0

""It's a shame about Tom, yeah?"" One of the perpetual water cooler gossips asked to the person standing beside him.
""Huh? What happened to him?"". He asked, bending down to pull out a cup for himself.
""Didn't you hear? It was all over the news."" The gossip paused, taking a sip from his own paper cup. ""Big rig slammed right into him on the interstate. Caused a five car pileup.""
""Oh, very funny guys."" Tom said, adjusting his tie. ""I'm pretty sure I'd remember something like that.""
The second man paused, his face scrunching up in thought. ""Is that why he's not in work today? Geez, any word on how he's doing?""
Tom frowned, and crossed his arms, as the gossip shook his head sadly. ""Dead on impact.""
Tom cleared his throat meaningfully. ""Okay, enough's enough. It wasn't that funny to begin with.
They continued to ignore him, though, as the second man looked towards the floor. ""Oh, wow. That's...that's unfortunate."" He paused for a moment, before looking back up at the gossip. ""If I can be totally honest, though? I never really liked the guy. He seemed standoffish.""
The gossip crossed his own arms. ""Really, Paul? Not even a day and you're already bad mouthing him? Show some respect, man.""
""Yeah, I'm right here. And I'm not dead."" He growled, looking between the two.
Paul shrugged. ""What? I mean I'm sorry for him and all, but that doesn't change the fact that he was a bit of a jerk.""
""Well, can you blame him? After all, you know he hasn't been the same since his wife..."" He trailed off, leaving the sentence hanging in the air.
""Woah, now you're going to far!"" Tom shouted out at the gossip.
Paul nodded sadly. ""Yeah, I guess. Well, at least they'll be together again.""
Tom turned to Paul, his anger starting to flare. ""That's it, I've had enough with you assholes."" He reached to grab Paul's arm. ""You don't even joke about...wha-?""
He stared as his fingers passed through Paul's arm. He pulled his arm back abruptly, waggling his digits in front of his face. He reached out with both arms, like a blind man grasping for something. His rage slowly turned to horror as his arms harmlessly went through Paul's chest.
Paul shuddered. ""I just got the worst chill.""
""Hey, that means someone is walking over your grave.""
Paul scowled at his compatriot. ""You need to work on your timing.""
Tom was deaf to the squabbling that ensued. He placed his closed fists to his eyes as images began to flash through his head. The rear-view mirror, the rapidly approaching headlights. The world turning inside out.
Just then, he heard a voice call out behind him. ""Tom?""
He froze up. It was a voice he had heard before. All too familiar, but one he had not been able to hear in years. ""Amelia?""
He slowly turned, his hands falling from his face. There she stood, just as he remembered her. Her hair still long and full, her body unmarred from her illness. She just stood there, tears welling up in her eyes. A thin smile on her lips as his eyes fell on her.
""I'm here, Tom."" She said, softly.
Tom rushed towards her, faster than he ever had run before. He wrapped his arms around her, his own tears flowing freely. ""Amelia."" He whispered into her hair.
He didn't know how long they stood there, wrapped up in their embrace. He could have stood there forever.
Finally, he spoke again. ""I thought I lost you forever.""
She pulled away just enough to look him in his face. ""I'm here now, that's all that matters.""
He closed his eyes, looking away briefly. ""So I guess that means that I am...""
She nodded slowly. ""The first few hours are always the toughest."" She pulled away from him, grasping him by the hand.
""But I'll explain it all to you later. Come on, it's time to come home.""",0
"Thomas was never very good with gifts. He always got something that was not quite what you wanted or not very thought through. At least he knew it and often included a receipt.
The first Christmas we had as co-workers and office neighbors, three years ago, Thomas got me a skateboard. I had told him that my son was a skateboarder; he had gotten mixed up and thought I skated instead. At my birthday Thomas once bought me a camera. I have no idea why. It was a good one too. Expensive. I returned it and used the money to get him a hard drive for his PC. He had said he needed one and wouldn't stop thanking me for a full two weeks.
The gifts kept coming and they never got better, but he kept trying. And no matter what I got him he was always grateful. It made me feel bad that I couldn't be as grateful in return. I knew that Thomas was always a good friend, and deserved a better friend than me.
So this year, after exchanging gifts once more, I sit in my office admiring Thomas's latest attempt at gift giving: a plain mug with my name on it, in plain text. I don't drink coffee, but I could not be happier with my present. It will remind me of him. Of the friend that he is and the person that I aspire to be like. I smile uncontrollably, staring at the mug. I could not be more grateful to Thomas.",0
"Captain's Log, Recorded from the Captain's Chair.
134 consecutive days searching the Outer Rim have depleted our supplies. All we have left are cup ramen, green beans, cans of black beans, canned oysters, and microwave curry.
This has had adverse effects upon the crew's stomachs and bowels. As such, the Interplanetary Coalition has requested that I keep conduct studies to enhance any future stocking of ships. I'm not entirely sure why it's so hard to understand that half the hold shouldn't be filled with this stuff, but orders are orders. End off the record thoughts.
Begin scientific recording:
One longer log 2.8 inches in length,9 inches in diameter. One shorter stick.3 inches long,.4 inches diameter. Both appear to be of a slightly greenish hue, with specks of black and reddened chili pepper. They have an overwhelmingly foul odor. Consistency is variable. 1 standard Inak of force causes a complete smashing of the logs edges. Yet at the center, 1 standard Inak barely penetrates the hardened exterior.
Four-stomached Hamlian First-Mate Jezolz has had little issue with the change in diet, and is the only crew member who is functioning at full capacity. Third-Mate O'Oa and Doctor Resh, both Pleqas with frontal and rear assholes, have been confined to the sick bay as of 0800 earlier today. The diet and their physiology have caused a more constant, fluid stream. Their excrement has minor expanding properties, and must be linked to the exterior disposal system at all times.
I may be producing a third log. I will conduct more measurements at 1900.",0
"The Prince and the princess
There once was a prince who loved a princess. But it was not to be, because this princess was already betrothed to another. But this prince could see that this princess was not truly happy. She was married to a dragon and her and that dragon were able to sire two children together. But as you know, the offspring of a dragon and a human is a demon. Now most people think demons are these horned creatures that go around creating misdeeds and causing havoc but that's not what demons do. Demons look just like any other person except they enjoy suffering. You see, unlike a regular person, demons love to see human beings suffer. I guess, that just makes sense given that so few demons are spawned by acts of love. Maybe demons aren't inherently bad. they're just nurtured that way.
Regardless, the prince saw this and he wanted to do something about it. What I haven't mentioned before is that this prince was actually also a knight. Hed also slain many demons but never a dragon. Demons are relatively easy to vanquish, but a dragon is a great accomplishment. The kind of accomplishment that so few knights are capable of doing but he was, because he was one of the greatest knights in the land.
The princess used to pretend she was happy. But the prince could see how unhappy she really was. When he would watch from the window, when she was all alone, away from the demons and the dragon, he could see her true sadness. The sadness that only the brave and handsome prince, the strong knight, would ever be able to chase away.
So one day, the prince entered where the dragon and demons lived. He was armed with a crossbow and an axe. Most knights would have used a sword but this particular night was fond of using axes because it's only with an axe that a true warrior attains a higher state of being. As he entered the door to the castle, he saw the dragon, the demons and the princess all eating dinner. The princess, of course, was pretending to be happy but the knight nnew better. Away the bolt flew from his crossbow and into the heart of the dragon,. The dragon stood up, trying to face down the knight but before he could the knight brought down the axe into his skull.
Seeing what a mighty warrior he was, the two demons began cowering and crying. They called out to their mother and the princess went to them, possibly still scared of what those demons would do to her. Knowing that the dragon's magic was strong, the knight pulled the princess away from the demons and slew them where they laid cowering on the floor.
The princess was traumatized. So many years and for so long, she had lived under the yoke of the dragon and the demons. She didn't know how to live a normal life. She didn't know true love. But now she would.
The prince pulled her into his arms and she began fighting him. The dragon's magic was too strong. The prince knew that the only way that the dragon's magic could be conquered was with love. So the prince threw his love over his shoulder and took her back to his castle.
Back at the castle, the situation seemed hopeless. Despite the prince's boundless love for the princess, the dragon's magic was just too strong. She continued to fight the prince. Numerous times, she attempted to escape. At one point, she even got to a local farmer and the dragon's magic started to infect the man so the knight struck him down before he could be corrupted completely.
It was then that knight realized that the princess, the love of his life, would need to be chained. Just like in Snow White, his love would awaken something inside of her but first she would need to stop fighting it. The prince chained the princess to her bed. The prince knew that what he was doing was unpleasant but no matter how confined her physical form may be, nothing could stop their love for one another.
Every morning and every night, the prince would enter the princess's room and expresses his love towards her. This continued for what seemed like ages until a miracle happened.
The princess was with a child. This was wonderful news. Just like the way a dragon creates a demon, a knight, being an instrument of God's will, produces only angels.
Now, I've told you this story every night for the past year-and-a-half, my love. and I know the dragon's magic still courses through your veins but I want to know what kind of ceremony you would like for our wedding. As you know, your marriage to the dragon was over as soon as I crushed his skull with my axe, so there's nothing keeping you from being my bride forever, now is there?",0
"After the set time for my waking up which I set last night at 7:00am passed, I opened my eyes to me standing up.
I, however, thought nothing of it as it happens everyday. What I thought about however, is that my food meter is
nearly depleted. And nobody likes it when their food meter is almost depleted.
So I walked, or more accurately, slid my feet down the stairs then walked straight towards the ""Winter-Chest"".
I grabbed the first food that I found that needed the least cooking skill to cook, hotdogs and some bread, threw
the hotdogs into the micro-fire oven, then ate them, resulting in a nearly full food meter.
But due to the sound the micro-fire emits, a certain level 40 upstairs woke up then went crashing down the stairs
and started blabbering about matters that I shall not list.
""Yeah, Yeah. Okay I get it mom, geez."" Is the magical incantations needed to make her stop.
""Whatever, just get yourself ready for school, bus is almost arriving."" Powerless against her, I just did what I
was preparing to do in the first place. I then did the neccesities for venturing outside, then waited for the bus
at the bus stop.
[Currently travelling. Destination: Some High School]
Basically, I don't like doing this quest line. But it's necessary to prepare me for the events that will
soon happen happen after level 18, apparently. Like getting your preferred job class or whatever since the
more beneficial (beneficial as in lots of gold income) jobs require high number of INT and WIS, which you need
for those classes.
""Oh, it's almost class time, see ya dude!"" One of my party members told me then made his way to wherever his class is.
'Might as well' is what I told myself as I made sure my books, pencils, and whatnots are inside my inventory.
So, as I said, this questline is quite boring. Other people will argue, and I see where they might
come from. ""But there's lots of sidequests to do!"" is one of the most spoken arguments about this. But being the
lazy player I am, I just don't want to, I mean, it's really a hassle. For example, the romance questlines are quite
complicated and the mean success rate among male players is somewhere around 50%. Not to mention, you might get the
""Ex"" encounter, or if you manage to get far into the quest line, you might have to face the ""Parents"" final boss.
That quest line's quite a hassle. Although I can see why people would do that.
""See ya tommorow, man."" I said to my fellow clan member as the end-of-the-day bell rings.
""Yeah, you too bro.""
On the other hand, clans, a little version of guilds, I find to be quite interesting. And in fact, joined one.
In particular, I joined the robotics club, due to a simple reason: you're gonna need that to unlock the robotics
skill tree, and in turn, little robot minions. It's quite simple.
[Daily quest: Go to School]
[Status: Completed]
[Classes Completed: +4 INT, +2 WIS, +1 STR, +1 DEX, +1 AGI, +100exp]
[Clan Task Completed: +1 INT, +1 WIS, +1 CHA, +50exp to Robotics skill tree.]
[Currently travelling. Destination: Home]
So after school, I essentially turn into a slime, and by that I mean I will do absolutely nothing until night time.
And by night time, just before opening the sleep interface, I like to open up my quest journal to see what I quests
and sidequests I still need to finish.
[Main Quest: Finish High School]
[Side Quest: Unlock Robotic skill tree]
[Side Quest: Improve Artistry Skill]
""Ugh...lot's and lot's of side quests..."" I mumbled to myself as I panned my eyes down the list. Until one thing
caught my eye.
[Side Quest: Find a Girlfriend.]
I sighed to myself, then smiled.
""Well, we're gonna have to work on that one"" As I pressed the okay button in the sleep interface.
P.S. Still somewhat new to writing, so pardon my amateur ways.",0
"""I'd imagine most of them have given up.""
Mark shifted in his fading seat. The follow-up question was obvious – eleven years on the circuit had honed his natural curiosity into a powerful journalistic weapon – but for the first time, the words stuck in his throat. He coughed nervously.
""Have *you*?""
Katherine smirked at him from across the table, her hazel stare burrowing into his forehead. ""Would you be here if I had?""
""Now that's not a fair—""
""Oh please, Mark,"" Katherine said, cutting him off. ""Let's not pretend this is something it isn't. I know the difference, remember?""
The reporter turned to the window, stifling the violent urge to say so many things he would inevitably regret. Outside, the sun headed for the horizon, a blanched version of its once-radiant self. He watched the sky, its azure glory reduced to a pale shade. It was almost indistinguishable from the clouds that billowed off into the distance; soon, only motion would differentiate between the heavens and the haze.
""Look,"" Katherine started, breaking the tension, ""you're just following a story and that's fine by me. I'll be your story. But for you to come back, after ten silent years, and expect me to believe this is anything but a professional obligation is—""
""You stopped.""
""Sorry?""
""You stopped initiating,"" Mark continued, still gazing at the fading landscape. ""I let it slide for a while, but when it didn't get better with time…"" His voice trailed off, swallowed up by the cavernous space between them.
""You know I've always been terrible with keeping in touch—""
""I was hoping this would be different.""
Gold-white sunlight filtered through the window, casting shadows on the washed-out wallpaper. Mark turned back and peered at the artist.
""You look good.""
""You don't.""
The reporter chuckled. ""Still honest as ever.""
""And you're still the eternal optimist,"" Katherine quipped. ""One of us has to be, I guess, and it's certainly not me.""
""That's not true! Remember Billy and Carol's wedding? You kept pushing me to learn the waltz, no matter how many times I said I had two left feet.""
""Well you learned it, didn't you?""
Mark took one look at Katherine's silly grin and burst out laughing. ""After stepping on your toes about a million times, of course!"" He tapped his temple. ""It's still up there somewhere, I imagine.""
The artist stood and held out her hand, nudging her head toward the open space in the middle of the room.
""Oh no, I couldn't—"" Mark began, but before he knew it Katherine had dragged him from the fading armchair.
""Come on! Arms out, elbows up, back straight… There! Now then, how does it go? *One-two-three, one-two-three*…""
The reporter and the artist spun around the room, a blur of joyous color on a dull background. The smell of Katherine's paint clothes – a strong mixture of fresh acrylics and turpentine – filled Mark's nostrils, familiar and intoxicating.
As they swept past the window, Mark slowed the waltz down. ""Isn't it beautiful?"" he said, gazing out at the pale sunset.
Suddenly, he felt Katherine's arms go limp. Mark saw the tears in her hazel eyes just before she buried her head in his shoulder, body wracked by grief. He wrapped his arms around her, doing his best to hold the breakdown at bay and cursing himself for being so thoughtless.
""What am I going to do, Mark?"" Katherine sobbed, her voice shaky and broken. ""When it's all gone, what am I going to do?""
""Shhh, it'll be okay,"" the reporter lied, holding the artist close. ""It'll all be okay…""

"She cried, the way she had when she when I first saw her. Tears cascaded from her eyes, her cheeks were red and a small amount of snot dribbled down her upper lip.
*I love her. I love you. *
Those were the first thoughts that came to my mind when I saw her. When she emerged from the womb and I set my eyes upon her beautiful face for the first time. I had cried too.
*I love her. *
It was soft in my hand, unrightly so. Something so simple has no right to be so powerful or wrong.
Her fit continued. Her legs and arms kicked out as she lay on her back. Her cries became louder, more intense, a sound that once drove me mad. She was a crier; she wasn't like her brothers who slept through the night just after three weeks. Growth spurts, teething, hunger, all of it would send her into a spell.
But she had grown up tough. I'll never forget when I saw her fall on the bike for the first time. The logical part of me let go, it pushed her away from me as the two wheeled vehicle moved across the pavement. But the fatherly side of me screamed. It shouted and pounded at the confines of my mind as I let go of my little girl. She wobbled and fell. It was my fault. The fatherly part of me took over and I raced towards her.
She was holding her knee and grimacing. Her eyes had begun to water but she hadn't started crying. I went to pick her up and she stopped me.
""I wanna try again, Daddy.""
Softball had been the same. Countless days we would come home from games and she'd have an icepack or bandage on some burn she got from sliding into a base. She wasn't the best, far from it actually, she was small and not as athletic as the other girls. But she had gumption. She had vigor. She was tough.
*I love her. I love you. *
And here she was, back as a babe before my eyes.
""*To enter paradise you must be cleansed."" * God's words echoed in my mind. I stood on the precipice of eternity, hell in one hand, heaven in another. ""*Cleanse yourself of your most wicked thought and you may enter, my Son."" *
She lay on a bed before me, her fit was about to reach its climax. As an early father the thought has crossed my mind, if only for half a second I wanted to be rid of the crying. I wished to sleep. Half mad, half sleep deprived, I wanted my independence back. But it was only for half a moment. It was only for the briefest of seconds yet it now defines my eternity.
The logical part of me told me it was not real. Told me that this was simply a test, no different than what Abraham had gone through. It said to do it and be done with it. To join my parents and brothers. To see my wife again.
But the fatherly part of me was ashamed, it screamed wrestled with the very real thing in front of me. It tore at my conscious and pitied what I knew I had to do.
The decorative pillow was in my right hand, it was small yet held giant repercussions. I knelt next to my crying daughter and lifted the pillow to her face. I started to cry with her.
*I love you…*
A flash of light, yellow and red, then nothing. I held her in my arms for the last time. The clouds and sky shot up before me but I did not move, the universe was moving for me. The world cascaded towards me, then
everything went dark.
---- -
""Push!""
""I see the head now, you're almost there, Dear. Keep pushing!""
She cried out and gave what little she had left.
""There you go, almost there!"" I gripped her hand and told her it was going well. I told her I was there, and that she was almost done. She wasn't listening though. Thinking back on it, I think I was more talking to myself than her.
Then the room was filled with something queer, a new sound added to the chaotic cacophony: a baby's cry.
""It's a girl!"" the nurse exclaimed. She swaddled the baby in a blanket and extended her to me.
""Here,"" she said, ""Congratulations, you're a father.""
I eyed my baby girl. My beautiful Olivia. She cried, tears cascaded from her eyes, her cheeks were red and a small amount of snot dribbled down her upper lip. I smiled.
*I love you. *

"In the middle of the Armenian forest, there was a den of wolves who had thrived for centuries preying on the young boys of a nearby village. They had been kidnapping young boys and infants so effectively that the villagers made it their tradition to sacrifice whomever was taken.
Hunting parties came and went but the den was never found, and the wolves found themselves never hungry.
But then came a time of sudden famine.
For the wolves found out, the young boys would move to other places outside their village. Young men were too big to try to abduct, and the wolves were chivalrous - they would never eat a woman.
Woofs was a young wolf who had decided to one day play a trick on the den when he howled ""BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"".
Several of the elder members growled as they came outside, only to find that no such boy existed.
""It was a joke,"" Woofs explained, somewhat pleased with himself, ""I just wanted to have some fun with you guys.""
""Woofs,"" Barks, the oldest council-wolf looked at him solemnly, ""This is a time of hunger - our bravest warriors have not yet return from their scouting mission, and I'm afraid that without any boys to feast on, we shall surely perish.""
Woofs hung his head in shame and nodded.
""Sorry sir.""
____________________________________________________
It was several moons later when one of the warriors returned. A meeting was put together immediately as the warrior was questioned.
""What happened?"" Barks demanded.
""T-t-the humans,"" the warrior panted, ""T-t-they have evolved their own society! They have something called technology and the 'Internet'! Human rarely leave their dens nowadays!""
""What are you saying?"" Barks had dread in his eyes, ""Surely the boys of humans must go out and play sometime?""
The warrior shook his head. ""No m'lord. They're on these colorful rocks on something they call the Facebook.""
Several of the other wolves muttered among them as Barks slowly acknowledged what he was hearing.
""If what you say is true, this is disastrous."" He looked at the warrior and towards the other den members, ""We must not lose hope! We will surely find some boys to feast on soon!""
________________________________________________________________
The news of the boys not leaving their homes had traveled quick among the pack.
Woofs looked grudgingly at solemn mood and then remembered the trick he had played before that made everyone riled up.
""Anything is better than this,"" he muttered before he drew in a large breath.
""BOYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!""
The wolves came scurrying out, panting with their tongues touching the ground. Noses sniffed the air as Barks emerged from the pack.
""What is going on here?""
""Woofs just lied again!"" one of the wolves shouted.
""There is no boy!"" The pack was starting to get riled up.
The wolves began growling at Woofs as he slowly backed up.
""Whoa whoa whoa,"" he stammered, ""I'm trying to help us out here.""
""Woofs,"" Barks looked at him with a heavy face, ""You are not permitted to sleep in the den tonight. Tonight, you shall scavenge for food.""
""Aww, do I have to?"" Woofs had never really gone scouting on his own before, ""This sucks.""
""Go now!"" Barks commanded, ""Or before I give you a real reason to howl about.""
Woofs quickly left the site and had been traveling for several minutes when his thoughts managed to catch up with him.
*This is unbelievable, I try to lighten the mood up and this happens. *
*I'm literally taking one for the team. *
*That damn old man needs to get off my-*
He heard the sound of footsteps. He quickly slunk back into a bush as the footsteps approached.
What could it be?
He was answered as several plump animals walked out into the area with very large tummies and seemed to have a lost look in their eyes.
*These are boys! Three of them! *
""Adolf, we are lost."" one of them grunted.
""If you didn't insist on stopping for a candy break,"" another responded, ""We wouldn't have been separated from the group!""
""I hate the woods,"" the third one took a bite from what looked like a candy bar, ""I wish I was at home playing Black Ups.""
The three sat down and began to play with the sticks in the ground.
*They're going to stay here. *
Without a moment's hesitation, Woofs sprinted back towards the den.
""Everyone! Everyone!"" he panted several minutes later, ""There are three boys!""
""Three boys?"" one of the wolves feigned interest.
""Yes! They're all plump from eating their human food!"" Woof was jumping up and down. By now, he had attracted the attention of most of the wolves. ""They're sitting right on the ground! We can have a feast with them!""
The other wolves began to laugh as Barks' voice loomed over him. ""And these...these boys, I suppose, are just sitting down in the woods just waiting for us to come get them?""
""Yes!"" Woofs wagged his tail eagerly.
""You want us to follow you?""
""Yes!""
Barks and several other of the dogs began to laugh.
""I'm not joking!"" Woof knew he couldn't miss this chance, ""One of them's named Adolf!""
""What kind of name is that?"" someone shouted, ""Now we definitely know you're lying!""
The wolves are roared with laughter as they walked back towards their den. Barks took one last look of disgust at Woofs and muttered, ""You disgust me.""
With no boys to eat, the wolves slowly died out and the den was eradicated.

"Gary's father always made sure to let him know that he was the reason his life was shit due to his wife dying while giving birth to him. If you ask anyone who knows Gary they will all agree that bruises were almost like tattoos on his skin. They never left.
His childhood was a living hell yet he swore to himself that he would transform all the abuse he was receiveing into examples of what he should never do to another human being.
When he turned 15 his father was drunker than usual and beated Gary up so much that he had to spent 3 days in the hospital. Gary did not want to comeback to his home after that, he was terrified. After taking a deep breath he went to the police station just to get completely ignored by the officers.
Gary's situation was hopeless, he had been wandering the city for 3 days with no safe place to stay and starving. Suddenly, walking down the street he came across a place were people fed the homeless. He ate as much as they allowed him to. An old lady who voluntereed there offered him to stay in her home if he was willing to help her feed the homeless. Gary agreed instantly, a warm bed was all he wanted.
Five years went by, Gary's father went to jail for almost killing another man in a bar fight. Gary took the chance and came back to his old home, horrifying memories came back to him when he opened the door but after a month he was now somewhat comfortable.
Everyday he would go to the shelter to help the old lady that saved his life, he became loved by the regular homelesses because of his empathy and surprising ability to cook.
One day, a recognised chef from the city decided to cook in the shelter for charity. He ended up mesmerized and astonished by Gary's cooking. So much that he offered a job in his restaurant. The abused yet lovely kid accepted with tears in his eyes, he would finally earn enough money to make his dream come true, open his own homeless shelter.
That night he went to sleep with a wide smile. At 4 AM in the morning a dog's bark interrupted his deep sleep. He went outside kicked the dog in the stomach until it shut up. He came back to sleep like nothing happened. He had the best sleep of his life. Gary woke up, made himself a cup of coffee, sat on his chair and looked out the window just to see the dog laying dead just across the street. He kept drinking his coffee a smirk drew in his face.",0
"It has been fifty years since the inaugural re-distribution. Tomorrow we will go through another one. We'll see how this great experiment has played out over the last half a century.
This process has been carefully studied, so I don't think there will be any surprises. There have been some unintended consequences, both immediately following the last re-distribution, and the days leading up to this one.
As expected, there was a combination of despair and joy as those that were once wealthy saw their wealth disappear from their grasp, and as those who had little suddenly had a lot.
There were riots when those who had grown accustomed to the lifestyle their wealth had provided were suddenly thrust into a life of poverty.
Some had worked all their lives for their wealth. Others had inherited it. It was those that had inherited their wealth that started to riots. Those that had build up their wealth through their hard work felt some hope that they might be able to do it again. Though there were definitely people in that group that were just to tired to try again.
And then there were those that suddenly received a great sum of money. They had gone to bed on the eve of the re-distribution poor, and had woken up wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. Obviously, there was much celebration in this crowd.
Finally there were those whose lives didn't change much. Their net worth had marginally changed in one direction or another. They may have been upset that they didn't get more, but that was tempered by the relief that they hadn't lost much.
As the dust settled on the first re-distribution a few things started to happen. The biggest of which was the utter lack of motivation on all sides.
Those that suddenly received a windfall hadn't had any training on how to manage their new found wealth. Many of them squandered it on frivolous purchase, enjoying the things that had been out of reach for them in the past. It's the common story of lottery winners. In a short amount of time they were back to where they were before.
The previously wealthy were able to re-capture some of their wealth from the luxury commerce that the newly minted wealthy were generating. But a lot of them also recognized that in fifty years they would be back to that precarious position. The memory of losing everything they had worked for made it difficult to risk spending their lives pursuing wealth when it could all be taken away arbitrarily.
So they stopped starting businesses, they stopped trying to invest their money wisely, and as a result there were less employment opportunities. The tax revenues went down in cities all over the world, so infrastructure started to suffer.
Everyone felt the tenuous situation they were in. Knowing that regardless of what they did, in fifty years all the wealth would shift again, and it was only chance that would determine who end up wealthy. And there isn't any reason to try and accumulate wealth or build anything of substance, when it will all be randomly assigned to someone else in the not so distant future.",0
"A boy rests his head on his pillow and stares at the ceiling. The day had been uneventful, and he had no joy to experience. He closes his eyes in an attempt to sleep, but hears a thud in his closet. He walks to it. ""Who interrupts my sleep?""
A deep voice answers, ""If you were asleep, your ears would not be working.""
The boy smiles, ""Clever...Can you make me smile?""
A few moments pass. ""Are you not afraid of me young boy?""
""No."" The boy answers nonchalantly. He truly felt no fear, but he felt curious and excited.
More silence fills the air before the being in the closet answers. ""Thank you, most that I have encountered flee before they even answer...No. I cannot make you smile young boy.""
The boy scoffs, and returns to his bed. Attempting one more time to close his eyes. Then he hears a voice underneath him. The boy felt curious and excited once again. ""Who dares interrupt my sleep!""
""I am sorry."" A raspy voice of a man bellows. ""I have lost my pillow, and I have not slept for 5 days. The longer I do not sleep the grumpier and clumsier I get.""
The boy rolls his eyes and decides to try and rest again. It frustrates him that despite two beings hiding in his own room, the day was still uneventful. Thoughts race in his mind, and an idea forms in his mind.
""Sir, I might know where it is!"" The boy exclaims.
""Oh thank you!"" A reply sounds from below him.
He walks over to his closet. ""Someone below my bed just told me that you are a bore to talk to.""
""A bore? Why...tell them I am sorry for being a bore."" The voice in the closet replies. The boy gets frustrated. The boring day must end here.
He stands and thinks, there must be a way to be entertained. ""He told me that he'd rip you apart once you fell asleep because of how boring you are!""
""What!? Well I'll will kill him first in his sleep before he kills me!"" The voice replies with anger. ""Will you help me young boy!""
The boy lit up inside. ""Yes. I will tell you when to strike. I will exclaim the words *Masaya*.""
He went back on his bed and talked to the voice below him. ""The person in the closet tells me he ripped your pillow into pieces! He wants you suffer!""
""He will pay for his treachery then! Young boy, will you help me bring justice to this fool!?"" The voice replied with rage, shaking the bed.
The boy answered, ""Yes! Once I say *Masaya*, it is your time to strike!""
The boy set a pillow for his head, excitement was tingling his body. He waited for a few moments, ""*Masaya! *""
The two beings jumped out from their places and ripped each other to shreds. Nothing was left of each other.
The boredom was gone, the day had ended gleefully.
The boy smiled and slept soundly.",0
"*But wait, why would anyone hold a surprise party for me? It's not even my birthday or anything. Also, I don't really have a lot of friends, so this doesn't make sense*, I thought. I then got into my car and started driving. Eventually I got out of the city. I kept going until I ran out of gas. *It seems everyone is just gone. Am I really the only one here? * — I couldn't believe what was happening.
I tried to call my brother, but he never answered. Then my phone turned itself off. I was worried, I was scared, I was angry. I didn't want to be the only one. I refused to accept that as the reality. I started walking, through the middle of nowhere, until I found a little house. It was empty, of course. I got inside, and grabbed a drink from the kitchen. Then I noticed the TV was still on.
I sat on the couch, and passed out while listening to the static. I don't remember anything else.",0
"The piano's keys hammered out a melody,
an enigmatic, haunting dirge, a eulogy without words
my fingers wrote, the air, their pages.
The ash from my cigarette graces my pants with a visit,
""what harm is smoking when you never die?"" And I,
I've never died, though I've tried.
All the king's horses and all the king's men,
couldn't tear me asunder, couldn't snuff out my flame.
My tune draws to a close,
I stand, to a standing ovation from a single uninvited guest.
I turn, and nearly die from shock. Ha!
Death stands watching amidst the empty tables, the barren chairs,
He'd always indulged in dramatic flair.
Tal and spindly, in pinstripe suit, hair impeccable, well groomed,
my heart reached to him, and my feet followed suit.
We embraced amidst the haze and heat,
The glow of flames, choking smoke,
""What harm is smoking when you can't die?""
I had to try.
The building ablaze, Death claimed me at last.",0
"As he was looking at the whiteboard in front of the class, Brandon knew he discovered something that was unique.
He didn't have the ""Eureka"" -moment until last night. He repeated the tests he had been doing for months now. Every test brought him closer to the speed of light.
He knew there was something to be done and yesterday he finally tested it. The speed of light was something he found interesting when he was young, and he finally realized it could be broken.
As Brandon proceeded to day dream, his teacher came closer. Brandon knew he needed to look like he was paying attention, but he couldn't ignore the fact that he finally solved one of life's biggest mysteries.
The teacher was slowly approaching his table and Brandon look at the teacher. ""Pay attention, Brandon, this information might save your life one day"", Brandon started smiling. ""Sir, I think I already get what you're saying..""
""Ha, you must be one of those kids that thinks he got it all figured out"". Brandon's smile got bigger. ""No sir, I actually don't, I don't understand how something could travel faster than the speed of light""
""That makes sense, Brandon, because nothing can"". Brandon's face had the most glorious expression it had ever had before. ""Sir, I already know that it's possible. I tested it last night"".
His teacher started laughing. ""Aren't you smart, Brandon. How did you do it? Did you throw a ball? Did you flick the switch off and on? Did you Elon Musk the shit out of the light?""
""No, sir. Actually, I thought it was rather easy. I simply measured the distance of a particle that seemed like it could travel faster than light. And I was right"".
His teacher had a confused look on his face. ""Everybody knows that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, Brandon. What's next, you're going to tell me you invented time travel?""
""Well, sir, even when traveling faster than the speed of light it's still not possible to travel in time. All you can do is go faster than the light. See, if the light of the sun takes 8 minutes to get here, and you travel faster than that light, all you see is stuff that happened within those 8 minutes. You could hypothetically travel back in time by 8 minutes at most, depending on how much faster you travel than the sun light""
In all these years the teacher had never heard so much bullshit. ""Get out"", the teacher said. ""If I wanted to hear made up shit about traveling and space I would call my Scientology friends""
""Sir, I swear I found a way to make stuff travel faster than light. If I can do it through a home test, imagine what we can do in the lab""
""You're banned from the Lab, Brandon. You're banned from my class now too. Get out. I don't want to hear any words coming from your mouth""
""Make me"", Brandon said. ""I'm sorry? "", his teacher looked like he was about to slap Brandon in the face. ""Everybody knows the that the formule is E=mc2""
""Yeah, everybody does know that, and everybody is wrong"", Brandon got furious. ""I literally found a way to travel faster than the speed of light, and I will show you""
Brandon came back to the same class the next day. His teacher stood in the doorway, looking at Brandon like he was a piece of trash. ""What's that? "", the teacher said. ""I will show you it's possible to get faster-than-light-speed travel. "", Brandon was determined to make his teacher shut up once and for all.
As Brandon was setting up his equipment, his teacher was making jokes about him to the rest of the class. ""Ladies and gentlemen, if you ever want to look like a fool then make sure to pay attention right now""
Then it happened. This loud noise coming from Brandon's equipment. The class went silent. Brandon just stood there with a crazy look on his face. He knew he did it, he knew he found the perfect way.
His teacher looked at the equipment. He looked at the class. He turned around and looked at Brandon. He started to feel nauseous, his head started to turn white. Everything he had ever known in life was falling apart. As the room went dark, all the teacher knew was that he had never seen anything like this before.
That teacher's name? Einstein.",0
"The librarian looked up and smiled when he entered. Its Saturday and he's in the library again.
Lee walked in and looked around at his world. A beautiful world that people with a passion had built. And he was all alone again. Of course there's that weird guy that comes in to read the newspaper, he'd seen him over the weeks and thought the paper is less than a buck to have delivered, why drive here cheapskate. Anyway, what was on the menu today.
Roaming up and down the isles looking at the funny numbering system 101.001 -500 to the left, 101.501-1000 on the right. Its nice to be able to understand what you're looking for. He liked this library, it still had an old fashioned card catologue.
Science. It makes sense. 'What subject though'. Flipping cards over and over 'Newton?' Can I understand this? Sure if they could figure this stuff out 300 years ago, i should be able to understand it now. A scrap of paper with some obscure numbers on it and off he goes.
'I've got all day.' An hour later the kid looks up and says ""this is some dry stuff"". Puts it back, while walking back, he sees Darwin. Stop. 'I've heard that name before, is this they guy they're always talking about in church?' He takes a single book back to the table, sits down next to the vacant computer terminal and sits down to start thumbing thru it. Read the book a bit, do a couple searches on the computer. It seems that answers lead to more questions.
'Jeez.. is there an end to this. Is there ever going to be a final answer?'
""No"" says the voice behind him.
Lee looks up and sees the newspaper guy sitting across from him. ""Uhm. Sorry, man, i guess i was thinking out-loud'.
Its cool. As usual there's only you and i and staff here i really don't worry much about disturbing anyone anymore. That's some heavy stuff you're reading. Darwin? Origin of the species. Interesting, but dry. What else you been nosing around in?
I was trying to read some Newton earlier, but that was even dryer than this. Do you know anything about this stuff? I keep hearing these names mentioned when i go to church and they really seem to hate these guys. Saturday is my day when when i don't have to be at school, no church, no youth group. I told my parents i was going to friends, (looks around) i guess i really didn't lie.
You got any opinions on this stuff?
You're a weird kid.
Yeah, i know. I'm Lee. I like to read. I was reading a website I'm not supposed to read and it kinda started me looking for more information. And now i take Saturdays off from my family and just kinda go exploring.
...John, he holds out his hand. Those are some heavy books you're reading. I started reading what was written and thought, someone else actually sees it too.
Huh? What do you mean 'see's it?'
I 'read' those books so very long ago. (As Lee looks at him very oddly, thinking, this guy isn't that old.) All those guys, they came to mean something to me. But as each one spoke, it killed a small piece of me as i understood the words they spoke more and more. You see, my whole life, I've lived in books. I love books, and they love me. I see the things in the world and then I always find a book in it. Nowdays, nobody reads the books anymore. They all watch TV and surf the internet. They, people (looking at a wall) just don't care. Learning anything takes time.
Sorry Lee, right?...You asked a question. What was it, do i have an opinion on anything. Lots of opinions, but very few answers. What do you want to know.
Everything. Lee smiled in response. John just chuckles. Big goals man.
""Lets try to narrow it down"" John says. Yeah, gotta start somewhere. You've got Darwins book there. What do you think about what little you've read?
I've heard the mention of Darwin in school. The teachers try to tell us we came from monkeys or something like that. I know my church is always talking smack about him. So i decided to read for myself. He sees John wince a little bit. Hey, you ok man. Yeah, John says. I get these chest pains at times. I'm not doing to good nowadays. Anyway, if you want to know the truth, I'll tell you the truth. The messed up part is nobody will listen to you when you retell it.
John starts talking, Lee asking questions in amazement of the stories he's hearing.
They talk for hours, one speaking of life and one asking questions.
What was that guys name you mentioned, Occam, i like that thought...the simplest path is usually the correct path. Keep it simple, no need to complicate things. Yeah i agree, i tend to go with that path although my teachers keep wanting long ass answers to things.
John, what do you do for a living. Do you have a job. I don't mean to be rude, but i wonder you look younger than my parents but you know a lot more than them. Are you rich?
Well, i used to own my company. There was a hostile takeover, and they literally tried to kill me to make sure I wouldn't get into their business. I was good at what i did, but these other guys didn't' like me in their territory.
Wow, they tried to kill you over your business?
Yep. Hired some guys to draw me out, got me coming out of dinner one night beat my ass stabbed me a time or two and then left me out to die.
OMG. (blurts out Lee) oops sorry, picked that up my little sister.
What were you doing. Fighting the mob? I've seen those movies, is that stuff real?
Well Lee, I guess you could say that. My business was secrets. I warehoused secrets and others didn't want me getting in their secrets. It was kinda like the dot com stuff you read about in your history books, have you gotten to that stuff yet?
Yep, during the 90's, the dot com boom. People were inventing ideas, not making any products and selling information to one another that really had no value. Lot of people got taken in. Looked like a good time for a while.
Yep, said John. That's the idea. But you see, I wasn't doing anything with the information. I kinda just stored the information and allowed others to get on with what they were doing. And in return they would pay me a weekly to monthly small fee to know their secrets were safe with me. The business was great, I was operating in 15 ish countries and then other companies got wind of what i was doing, how great the cash was and they started rewriting the rules. My company kinda fell apart. And now i just kinda hang out in places that nobody goes waiting for what i know is going to happen. It happens to us all.
John closes his eyes. You can see the pain in his face.
So, wow. I don't know where to go now. Got anymore reading suggestions for me.
John laughs, you really enjoy the learning don't you. Its addictive. I'm going to tell you this Lee. There are so many guys that offer you new visions of what the world you're going to inherit is. Sagan, Tyson, Dawkins...wow...so many books and so little time to understand all the words.
(I see his eye twich like he's really in pain now)
I'll tell you this, by the time you read those books and more like them. You'll understand so much more about your world. You wont need to seek out people for an answer, you'll become the answer. A friend and teacher of mine told me one time, There are 3 things that do not remain hidden for long. The Sun, The moon and The Truth. (a wince) Remember, Knowledge is power. Yeah, i know kinda corny. But true.
Hey John, i gotta get going. I need to pick up my suit on the way home for church tomorrow. I know the pastor always get happy when people bring new folks to church. You want to come with us? My parents have their own pew you can sit up on the front row with us.
Wow, its been a long time since i was invited to a church. But I'm going to pass, they really don't sit too well with me anymore. We kinda have a different view on things nowadays.
I tell you what Lee, you seem like a good hearted kid. I've got some traveling to do. I'll see you in a few weeks maybe. You knock out those names i've thrown out and when i get back. If you still feel the need to talk, we'll talk.
Ok.
Cya John. Cya Lee.
6 weeks later, Lee is walking into the library. He drops the Dawkins book on the counter and the librarian looks at him kinda disapproving. He notices the shiny gold cross and the well worn bible on her desk. And just shrugs. Uhm...Miss? Yes young man. Hey you know that guy that used to hang out in here reading the papers on the weekend. Have you seen him lately?
The librarian kinda gasps and covers her mouth. We weren't supposed to talk about it, but he was here a couple weeks ago and kinda slumped over in a chair. We called 911 but never heard much about him after that. I had forgotten about him until you mentioned it.",0
"General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before. He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of ""The Revelation"" dating all the way back to the Johnson administration. It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program. If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief. Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting.
It was largely forgotten by all who made it up, until Jim Fletcher remembered a funny story he had heard at a Christmas party a few years ago. He saw who Nixon's successor would be, figured Gerry Ford had a sense of humor, and gave it a shot. What he didn't expect was that President Ford would buy it hook, line, and sinker. To save NASA the embarrassment, he quickly had official reports drawn up with shaky physics to explain why millennia of accepted science was wrong, and why it had to be kept a secret from the community at large.
Over the years, it became a tradition, part of the President-Elect's initiation into the country's highest office. Most of them figured that with that much technobabble, it had to be true, though a few struggled with it. After Jimmy Carter was elected, there was some concern, as he had sailed around the world in his Navy days. The physicists cooked up a line about gravitational lensing near the edge of the earth causing ships to imperceptibly turn away, and Carter took it as truth. Reagan laughed it off, H.W. ignored it, and Clinton believed it all. Their next concern came in 2001, when Senator Glenn let an old colleague know that President Bush had been asking about it. After savoring the mortified look on Mr. Goldin's face, the Senator let him know that he was one of the young astronauts who came up with the joke in the first place.
Even with the years of tradition behind it, it was still a nervous time for the Administrator. To be found out was to risk dismissal or worse, risk losing funding for NASA. Still, there were certain things that just had to be done. Certain rituals to be observed, for old time's sake.
General Bolden nervously cleared his throat as he said those words his predecessors had said so many times before: ""Mr. President, could we please speak in private?""",0
"I'm just a placeholder right now. I stand here to make the city of Yavin seem reasonably well-populated, but they haven't given me any dialogue. They've finalized my artwork, though. I've got blue hair. I don't think anyone else in town can say that.
...
I've got dialogue now!
""Have you been to the market yet? It's just east of here. Visit the **Pie Shop** while you're there!""
Not a lot, but it's fun to say, and it'll be really helpful to any adventurers who walk by, I'm sure.
...
They added random-walk movement so that we don't look like we're all rooted to the ground. Yavin is really bustling now!
...
I met this weird guy running through the town, I think he was a playtester. He kept bumping into me as I was wandering the narrow streets. We did that annoying thing where you step aside to let someone through, but they sidestep at the same time and bump into you again.
The next day, they slowed down our random-walk code. I guess it'll be easier for the PCs to navigate, but Yavin's lost some of its hustle and bustle.
...
I'm running the **Pie Shop** now! It's a big step up from just standing around and advertising it. Instead, they gave me a little scripted scene where I bump into the PCs when they first enter town, say a little bit about where they can find everything, and then tell them to stop by my shop for a pie. I think it's because the play-testers kept getting lost. Anyway, it's a funny scene. I have to learn a lot more lines, and I've got a whole dialog tree to keep track of when I'm manning the shop, but it's worth it.
I wonder what happened to the original owner of the pie shop. Did they re-use his sprite for something else, or was he just deleted?
...
I'm proud to announce that I've got a beautiful wife and daughter now. Someone thought that the **Pie Shop** looked a little bare with just me, I guess.
My daughter's first words were ""I love pie!"" Isn't she adorable? They'll probably change that before release, though.
...
My family now has a little side-quest where the PCs help me find ingredients for an **Elvish Lembas Pie. ** My daughter mentions that I once baked her an amazing Lembas Pie but I haven't made it in a long time, then my wife complains about how you can't get some ingredients unless you travel to the Elf Kingdom. If the PCs are smart, they can put two and two together, bring me some Lembas from the Elf Kingdom, and I'll bake it for them for free! It's a really amazing pie, heals 500 HP, 500 MP, cures status effects, and tastes like a little slice of heaven.
Kids grow up so fast these days, don't they? It's been barely a week, and my daughter is already helping the family business and handing out plot hooks.
...
Something is wrong. There are two sets of graphics for my shop now. One normal, and one with the roof caved in. I walked inside, and found there was completely new art for the interior as well. The display case smashed, the inventory looted, the door off its hinges, holes in the walls and roof. Something bad is going to happen, I can feel it.
My family's art is still normal, and none of us have new animations. Are we safe, or are we simply not finished?
...
I asked my neighbors if any of them had been revamped, and found that the destruction had spread. The streets were littered with debris, there were dozens of new ""on fire"" animations attached to the buildings, and full on half the residents had corpses added to their sprite-sheets. Yavin is going to burn, and the PCs won't be able to save us.
...
They added a corpse sprite to my wife. When the disaster hits, she'll be crushed when a wall collapses on her. They didn't even bother to render most of her, there's just her upper body and a splatter of red where her legs should be. At least we know what'll happen to her.
I need to figure out how to explain this to my daughter. I can handle a change like that in my life. If it turns out that our whole city is crushed under the Gallian Empire's war machine, and I'm reduced to standing in the ruins and saying ""Promise me you'll make them pay!"" to any PCs that pass by, I'll survive. I've had worse dialogue, back when I was a placeholder.
But my daughter? Her whole life, she's been part of the shop. She helped my wife bake, she ran around and played and got in the way of the playtesters who wanted to buy pies, she's handed out sidequests...If (no, *when*) Yavin burns, she'll lose everything. She'll just be another atrocity paraded in front of the PCs to give them motivation to fight the Gallians. I hope with all my heart that the developers won't use her like that.
...
I couldn't figure out how to explain what the update meant to Elspeth, but I think she found out anyway. Something got added to her dialogue last night, and she burst into tears when she read it. I tried to comfort her, but she gave me the strangest look when I reached out to her. I don't know what's going on.
Hang on, ""Elspeth""? They gave my daughter a name? Is she important to the plot? I'm feeling a little more hopeful now. We'll see how things go in the next update.
...
I still haven't gotten a sprite or dialogue update. Elspeth, by contrast, changes daily. Her dialogue tree keeps growing, it looks to be bigger than mine. Her sprite-sheet has new animations. Searching. Sobbing. Digging. She's got more dialogue and animation than almost anyone else in town, but none of it seems to be happy. She still doesn't want to talk about it, she's stayed cooped up in her room practicing her lines.
My wife's been going over her old dialogue; I think she's trying to stay in a happier time for as long as she can, before the game ships. I wonder if I should join her. Nobody's buying my pies anyway, so why not? We can go back to that goofy scene where I crash into the PCs and advertise the pie shop. It has to be better than sitting here, wondering what new tragedy will visit my family. Are they ever going to update me?
...
I finally realized why I haven't gotten any updates for after the Burning of Yavin. I'm ""missing, presumed dead."" I should have known, it wasn't just an oversight from the developers. I'm going to disappear, and I'm never coming back.
I asked Elspeth how long she'd known. Ever since the first update, apparently. Her first line of dialogue after the Burning is ""Please, have you seen my dad?"" For over a month now, she's lived with the knowledge that she'll lose both her parents halfway through the game. There's nothing any of us can do about it, that's just what the plot demands.
The only consolation I could give her was that the game isn't finished yet. Her dialogue tree is still growing. The ending to our story hasn't been written. Anything could change - the developers might even spare Yavin completely.
I don't think I was very convincing, though. I don't believe it myself. Elspeth's situation has too much pathos. The developers clearly want her to be a symbol of the whole town's suffering - give the PCs a face to put on the atrocity. Elspeth is a smart girl, she's studied the plot as much as I have, she must know this too.
How do the PCs deal with this? I'm pretty sure they all lose their parents or their village or their mentor or something at the very start of the game. Are they just stronger-willed than a mere pie merchant?
...
There was another change, this time to my shop's art. After the ""ruined"" artwork, there's some art of a little market stall, small but colorful, like the ones that dot the market in town's non-ruined state. It's small, it's ramshackle, it's literally built on the rubble of the previous building, but it's unmistakably a **Pie Shop. ** Does it get rebuilt? There's no scripting attached yet, but I'm hoping there's a quest there.
Hope. That's something I haven't felt in a long while.
...
Most of the major shops have ""rebuilt"" artwork now. Ramshackle, but they have everything you need to run a shop (i.e., a counter for you to stand behind, and an inventory). It's a quest! A whole set of side-quests, in fact. The PCs can gather building materials and donate treasure to restore the city of Yavin. Things are going to get better. We can rebuild, little by little, devs willing.
They also updated Elspeth's art. I think she's going to hit her growth spurt, because the new art is a bit taller. She's also wearing an apron like her mother. She's going to rebuild. She's going to keep running the pie shop.
We practiced our dialogue as a family again, for the first time in months. Teaching Elspeth all the little ins and outs, what happens to pies in your inventory and what you do with all the vendor trash the PCs sell. I'm still apparently ""missing"" after the Burning, but I'm finding that easier to deal with. I know we can trust our daughter to carry on for us.
...
Elspeth was smiling today. Not only that, there are some new sprites in her sprite-sheet. They're smiling too.",0
"Roslyn stepped down the ladder facing forward and the box caught on the attic floor. She caught it with her left hand. Lugging the box to the TV, she flipped off the lid and grabbed the un-labled white VHS tape. She clicked the old Zenith TV on and slid in the mystery tape.
""Hello, ladies. My name is Robert. First, a bit about myself. I'm single. I play the French horn. I'm a great musician. I work as a salesman at Rico Outfitters on 3rd and 4th.""

The three sit in the tense silence of the living.

He dreams of family, of starshine, of the warmth that the Void never saw use for.
""We are now aberrations."" The silence is broken by Ntlia, their previous life as the Philosopher General betraying them to existentialism. ""We should not exist in this universe. We should not exist in this multiverse. If our Red Hand was still active, we would not exist, and all would be in order.""
""But we do exist,"" replies the last of the three, mandible-deep in the birth-fluid in a futile attempt to stave off the presence of inevitability. ""That is our lot, Philosopher General. Would you deny your own destiny for a concept from a dead universe?""

Ntila falters in their despair as Fourthmale sits up, scanning the area, wide awake with glowing blue sclera. A gentle clicking sound can be heard from his abdomen. Fourthmale moves methodically to the very edge of our universe, and humming in joy-terror, he steps off, floating into the unknown.

"It's easy to get lost in himself today as on this particular day, this round of golf was the greatest played game of his life.
He was enveloped in the smell of the grass, the cool breeze, and reveled under the shade of the tree he shared his first kiss with her.

"""Well, what are you waiting for?"" Adam tapped his foot impatiently, arms folded, ""Just try sticking it in.""
Eve glared at him. ""I *did*. It doesn't want to fit. This can't be the way.""
Rolling his eyes, Adam unfolded his arms. ""Look, there are a limited number of holes and things to put in them. That big wiggly thing on the end of one of my trunks looks like the best bet.""

The snake slid back up into the tree, sliding behind the foliage, but not so far that it couldn't still see. Both Adam and Eve seemed intent on their activities, not bothering with it. Head slowly swaying back and forth, the snake watched the tangle of limbs for a a few minutes before a booming voice exploded into its ear.
**WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? **
Cringing, the snake glanced over to see a point of pure light beside it from which the voice echoed.
""Jussssst helping them procreate.""
**FOR MY SAKE LUCIFER, YOU WANT *MORE* OF THEM? IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO CONTROL TWO! **
""Well why did you give them the toolssssss required to make more then? They would of courssssse figure it out eventually.""
**THEY WERE A SAFETY MEASURE; JUST IN CASE WE WANTED MORE. NOW THEY'LL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE. **
The snake made a valiant attempt at a shrug. ""That'ssss your problem.""
**I CAN FIX THIS. ** A blinding flash consumed the garden. **THERE. **
Looking around for a few seconds, the snake narrowed its eyes and turned back to the point of light. ""What isssss it that you have done?""
**THE FEMALE WILL NOW HAVE 9 MONTHS OF UNCONTROLLABLE EMOTIONS AND A USELESS MEMORY BEFORE EACH CHILD COMES OUT, A PROCESS WHICH WILL BE EXCRUCIATING. **
""What of the Male? How will he be controlled?""
**HE WILL HAVE THE URGE TO MATE WITH EVERYTHING FROM A YOUNG AGE. **
A moment of silence passed, broken only by the grunts and exclamations from below. ""How doesssss that help? That just makesssss it worsssse!""
**HE WILL FEEL PAIN AFTER A FEW DAYS OF NOT SPILLING SEED. I SHALL ALSO, IN MY WORD TO HIM, FORBID HIM FROM MATING IN ANY WAY OTHER THAN TO REPRODUCE. **
Silence again reigned for a few moments before the snake looked back, awe on his face. ""That'sssss the most impresssssssively created punisssssshment I've ever heard.""
Grunts and moans echoed throughout the garden of Eden as the first two humans, blissfully oblivious made a concerted effort to get the human race started.",0
"Told from Pooh`s perspective
So me and my mates are having a ball at Chris`s birthday. You know, loud music, (holy shit Kanga and Roo are the best DJ duo [even though he's 15 now]) good location, some good beer, and Chris looks horny. I ask him"" Bother, Chris, why are you looking so odd?""
He responds, ""Old bear, I was thinking that we could go to a strip club.""
Trigger, who tried some shot combining a espresso and vodka, and now is even crazier than normal, shouts ""oh YES YES YES getting laid is what tiggers do best!""
I would describe the rest. Of the evening, but I have a multimillion dollar contract now with Disney, so I can't exactly talk about that. Say, would you like some honey? A happy, healthy appetite, makes a happy, healthy you!",0
"""Oh but why can't we take our memories with me? I don't want to forget you again. I remembered you the moment I saw you again here, but if I have to go back I don't want to forget you.""
""My darling, our brain can't handle the the strain of such vast experiences on the physical plane. Our bodies are much more delicate than our souls. That is why we begin and end at infancy. So that our brain simplifies.
Infants don't have the cognitive abilities to retain as adults do.""
""But I lost you so many years ago. When you died, a part of me died with you. I wish I had known I'd see you again and I would have died too, just so I might have more time with you.""
""And that, my dear, is exactly why we must forget. Life is too beautiful and much too precious to waste. For we still do not know what awaits us after this. I tell you what, tomorrow is your
deathday, and you shall turn 10. Let us celebrate with a grand party and icecream!""
Nine years and twelve months later.
As I hold my lover in my arms, I coo her to sleep and watch her breathe. I know that she will not remember me, but I watch her delicate body nestle into my arms, her breath slows and her mouth slowly twitches into a quiet dreamy smile. This is how I will remember my wife for the
next 12 years that I am here. My infant, my angel, my soulmate. I cared for her in sickness and in health in life, and in death, I hold her in my arms and father her. There is an innocence, a purity in our love now, a love that I never knew in mortal life. She will never know that she taught me how to nurture. I will always be by her side, as long as I can be. And in our next life, I only pray that she finds happiness and peace. Only thirty seconds to go until her last breath. My heart quickens and I realize that she
must have experienced this for me that day in the hospital when I died. The thought of her pain and suffering brought me to tears. I ferociously mourned into her soft, peach fuzz hair. I rocked forward and backward, not to comfort but for myself. I kissed her forehead and held her close to my chest, and cradled her until she took her last breath.
""I will see you again, my darling. I will meet you on earth as I have in the heavens. Happy birthday.""",0
"*So this is my first reddit post, I'm preparing for a timed writing test/interview. I used this prompt to write a quick scene from a plot I've been working on for some time. So it is slightly out of context. *
The garden behind the grand hall was unpaved, the plants grew naturally, not curated. The dry desert dirt formed a cloud behind him as Raenin's determined wolf hide slippers ran forward, his rough olive toned hands holding his robes so as not to trip.
The grand hall was empty. The oak carved benches and tables lined the matching oak walls without purpose. Raenin proceeded through the garden seating area and into the empty wooden room.
""Phirae!"" he shouted ""Jihah!"" The cathedral ceilings seemed to mock his shouts creating smaller ones to follow. The tall, tan and well-built young man looked to his left. The oak paneled wall was unmoving, there was no door but he could tell no one was behind it. The archive was empty. He peered to his right at the long narrow hallway. He ran. weaving through the unpolished oak pillars he looked for one of the seven doors to be open.
""Phirae!"" he shouted again.
A noise came from behind him. Feet beneath a padded dress, from the kitchen at the front end of the hall. Raenin turned to see Ms. Forsythe; Phirae's house handmaiden wore an unusually stern expression and lifted her finger to signal the boy to quiet.
""Where is she?!"" Raenin's breath refused to calm, ""Where?!""
""Calm down, boy."" The large but strong woman reached for his arm, ""They've left for the council meeting already.""
""I must find them. It's been taken. The second book has been taken.""
""Taken? You don't mean stolen, my boy?""
""Yes. Stolen.""
""That's impossible, they've all been at the meeting. No one is home. Save me and Greig. And he's most assuredly been with the horses.""
""I know it wasn't you or Greig."" Raenin grabbed the woman's slightly thick forearm pulling her back through the hall outside and around to the far left end of the castle. The entered the archive through a small door in the center of the wall. It opened easily, broken.
Ms. Forsythe looked at Raenin worriedly and followed. The open door allowed the light to wander in revealing the dust hovering over each antique, each book and each shelf. The shelf they sought sat in the far back right corner of the room, it was labeled ""Reference- Jihah's First and Second"", one book sat on the shelf, bound in emerald leather, there was no engraving.
""Oh no."" Ms. Forsythe pursed her lips, ""No no no. Raenin how did this happen? Who was this?""
""I don't know."" Raenin replied, ""I truly do not know. All I heard was a sigh, a laugh and then I saw it, the shelf."" When Raenin was given The Sight it wasn't in full. He had not been born with magic and to be gifted it was very different. His half-powers only allowed for minimal visions.
""Raenin,"" Ms. Forsythe had already developed a solution, ""Go to Greig. Prep your horse and run. Find them. Find the council. They are at the desert center. You have three days.""
Without pause the boy did as told. Ms. Forsythe stayed behind to barricade the door.
Greig was a quiet boy. He stood no taller than five foot and no one seemed to know how he controlled so many large beasts with so little muscle. Still, he was the best barn hand the castle had had, he required no room, no food and no clothing to be made, just the barn.
The pale gaunt fellow prepared the dopple gray gelding for departure and Raenin left without a word. He had gathered bread and water from the kitchen. Enough for two days.
...
The round room at the center of the desert was built entirely of marble and lined with the stones of the goddesses. There was no entrance or exit, such permissions needed to be granted by the building itself. Inside the marble seats formed an even heptagon. The women in each seat wore the color of her gem and her goddess necklace revealed hanging just below the chest. One seat had remained empty for over fifty years now, a singular ruby stone set in its back.
""We agree then, to aid the tribal wars to the east with only medical care, food and water. To all troops."" The Emerald Jihah ran each conference as the eldest, finalizing all decisions. The other five would raise a hand in agreement, only able to speak when asked. ""Moving on the the next prayer requested, the Southern tribes are experiencing floods. Their homes have-""
The marble shook like thunder opening just next to the red seat. The goddesses reaching for weapons and necklaces in response, immediate defense. Raenin entered,
""Lady Jihah's, please accept my pardon."" He kneeled making sure to meet the eye of no one. Not even his beloved Phirae, ""I come in urgency. The desert castle needs you.""
""Go on, child."" Emrald lowered her blade, signaling the rest to follow.
""The books, Emerald and Amethyst, Amethyst has been taken. I don't know who, but it was in bad faith. The archive was broken into.""
The room remained silent as Emerald looked down, hands shaking in an attempt to hide rage. Her green eyes shifted to the empty ruby seat, ""This conference is cancelled. Amethyst and I must leave."" She gestured toward the youngest goddess and Phirae stood ready and afraid.
""Jihah,"" she spoke out of turn, ""What is that they want to do with the book?""
""Change it, my girl. Change history. It will no longer possess the truth.""",0
"Be calm Sarah, there is nothing to be worried about.
I sat in the student-pickup loop, repeating these words as nothing but foreign cars past by. My mother was usually the first person in line, but today that streak was broken. In fact, I had been sitting on this bench for almost 20 minutes, and still she refused to dispel my growing fear.
I almost started hyperventilating when all of a sudden from the corner of my eye, I spotted my crush. Trevor Miles, Mr. Popular but still talked to everybody without fear of judgement. He was perfect in a rugged way; his dreadlocks and slight 5 O'clock shadow danced with his perfect lips and infinite eyes. I once was caught in his gaze when he picked up a pencil I dropped in homeroom, and I felt like I was going to go insane if I kept staring any longer.
All of a sudden he noticed me staring at him, and I quickly looked away trying to be as smooth as possible. I guess I failed, because he started walking towards me now. Oh god, no. I am already panicking Trevor, please don't finish me off.
""Hey Sarah, your mom didn't come already? That's a first, I'm normally the last person here."" he said with his unfair smile, destroying any semblance of control I had over my manic state.
""Uhh...yeah. I guess she got caught in traffic or something. Or maybe her car didn't agree with her driving habits and went on strike or..."" I said before shutting my idiotic mouth. I never had a boyfriend all throughout high school, and I swore it was my inability to just play it cool. Every time I started mouthing off clever jokes, they were met with laughs, but subsequently all the date offers whizzed past me. I could see him smirking at my comment, and I accepted that my future with him ended so abruptly.
He started since I stopped talking, ""Ah well no matter, its cool to have someone else here with me for once. Remind me to thank your mom's car for the company.""
I giggled, but for a fleeting moment. This smooth son of a bitch didn't understand how rude he was being. Someone so cool, trying to flirt with someone like me as if anything will come of it. Sure I was pretty, but my social standing was anything but. He was maneuvering like I won't catch feelings and hope that I could actually be his girlfriend, and that all the girls wouldn't treat me like shit after seeing him giving me attention. It was cruel in hindsight, harmless in the moment.
""Well, I just hope she's alright. It's freezing out here."" I muttered under my breathe.
He saw me starting to shiver when the wind blew, and responded,"" Do you want my jacket? I'm fine.""
No you asshole, I don't want your pity attention.
""S....sure, thanks.""
He wrapped his warm coat over me, and lightly cuddled with me on the bench, like the unaware douche bag he was. I hated him, but I was warm.
I sat with him for about 10 more minutes until my mother arrived, and I had just remembered I was freaking out about her moments ago. Trevor completely erased my worry, so quickly I forgot something might have actually happened to her. She jumped out of the BMW, apologizing profusely, going on about her car randomly dying on the highway. Trevor smirked, and I elbowed him in his side, laughing to myself. Just before I got in the car, and right as my mom turned her back, Trevor whipped me around and gave me a light kiss right on my forehead.
""Wh...what the hell was that for?"" I asked, slightly angered while my heart was racing.
""Well I thanked the car..... might as well thank you too. You can keep my jacket till tomorrow Sarah, I'll get it back from you after 2nd period."" he said, looking towards the entrance of the school as his sister pulled into the loop.
""But everyone will think-"" I started, but he stopped me.
""Exactly, now go home girl."" he said with his god damn smirk.
I hated him more than ever.
""Alright lover boy, see you tomorrow."" I said, wincing at my terrible comeback.
I got in the car, flustered, and promptly berating my mother for being late, followed by requesting she picked me up later from now on.
(I am a male, so sorry if it sounds exaggerated)",0
"He sat on the sidewalk, watching people enter and exit the door before him every few minutes. No one really paid him any attention, maybe because he and his coat were covered in dirt. But, that's the way life was when you didn't have a home. Cleanliness didn't matter as much as satiating your hunger, and there was certainly food to be had beyond this door.
There didn't appear to be anything special about the door or even the building. It looked similar to the rest of the buildings on this street. But there was something different about it. Most notably, when the door opened, delicious scents filled his nostrils.
A couple and their child emerged from the door and walked down the street. The door stayed open for half a second before it started to close again. During that time, he was hit by a tidal wave of scents that sparked his hunger and summoned saliva. Spiced meat, potatoes, greens, oh he could almost taste it! The excitement the smells inspired brought him to his feet. Surely someone would come outside with extra food? Perhaps they would see him and share their bounty? The thought made his mouth water more.
He had to get in there.
The door had already closed again by now, but he knew it wouldn't be long before someone else exited or entered, leaving the door open briefly. So he waited, imagining the luxurious edibles that would soon be available to him. He looked down the street and saw a father and his daughter approaching him and the door. New patrons, perhaps? The little girl, bundled up in her coat, waved to him and smiled. He returned her enthusiasm as the father opened the sacred door, ushering his daughter inside. This was it. This was his chance.
He dashed inside before the door closed behind him.
The smell of the restaurant was so much more intoxicating when you were inside! Overcome by excitement and the prospect of food, he sprinted through the building, driven by hunger.
""What the..."" someone began to yell. ""Get that dog out of here!""
But it was too late. Dashing around corners and under tables, the golden retriever found the source of the scent, stood on his hind legs, and grabbed a delicious tenderloin steak from a surprised patron's plate.",0
"**Thump Thump**
*Alright Eradicus, the friendly party will come through in about 10 minutes, the mid bosses already phoned in saying they were about to fight so its all up to you now, you can do this*. The 112 foot demon sighed to itself, and went back to rubbing its hands. It wasn't for warmth, as Eradicus had balefire powerful enough to melt the earth itself and evaporate whole rivers in the blink of an eye, it was instead a nervous habit.
**Thump Thump**
*Alright, I'll just activate the keystone runes that activate my hellguards and I should be fine, they got buffed recently meaning their armor is better, this time will be alright, it'll be okay*. Eradicus almost started hyper ventilating before mentally stopping himself, flicking on the runes for the hellguards and the lava pits and ghost effigies.
**Thump Thump**
Eradicus looked down, casting his horrifying 4 eyed visage downwards to what appeared to be a naked boy. Eradicus tilted his head, bemused. ""Ca- Can you please stop that?"" Eradicus asked, his demonic voice echoing across the vast chamber, the deep sound reverberating across the skulls and bones cast around the ground. The naked boy looked up, ""I am lord Timmothy the fearsome! take this fiend, hiyah!"" The boy whacked Eradicus on the ankle again with his toothpick of a sword. Eradicus let out a pained sigh, sounding akin to a raging furnace letting out swathes of steam. Eradicus tried his best to do a smile, assuredly making numerous puppies die somewhere at the sheer terror of the event. ""Timm- Lord Timmothy the fearsome, I have something to resolve at the current moment, so can we please continue this later?"". Timmy stopped whacking Eradicus's ankle, ""Hmmmmmm...You may have the great Timmothy's mercy this once fiendish fiend! But I will stay here until you are finished!"". Eradicus sighed once more, going back to mentally reassuring himself. ""Do you have any games? or a phone I can borrow?"" asked a shrill voice from the corner of the room. Eradicus turned his 500 tonne body to look the source of the question in the eye. ""I do not have any games, I am a demonic undergod can you not see? Please let me concentrate child"". Timmy let out a huff and started pouting in the corner, before whacking one of the hellguards on the toe with his wooden sword. The hellguard looked uncomfortable, but as it lacked any organs or vocal cords in its skeletal frame, it was unable to ask the boy to stop. Eradicus gave the hellguard an empathetic look, before going back to switching on the boss room runes. Being an undergod just wasn't worth it anymore.",0
"""I can't stand this political nonsense""
Dad threw his paper down on the table, interrupting our otherwise peaceful family breakfast. My sister and I looked up from our bacon and eggs and exchanged looks. We all know where this is going.
""It's just the same crap every year"" he grunted in frustration.
""Honey, maybe it'll be better this year,"" signed my Mom, obviously trying defuse my dad's daily rant.
""It's always the same ludicrous promises,"" continued my dad banging his fist onto the table, ""they never about the real issues. When was was the last fucking time they even mentioned our debt problem!""
""William, the children,"" warned my mother.
""We only have two choices, and both candidates are clearly corporate sell-outs, nothing more then puppets,"" dad continued, clearly not stoping his rant for anybody, ""what is the point of the democracy if my votes mean absolutely nothing because both sides are such garbage.""
Dad had settled down back into his seat sipping his coffee. He always got angry in the mornings, and it's always so amusing to see him so worked up about such silly things.
""When the aliens took over I thought I'd be different, but even if the names have changed and they now look like bloodsucking monsters, apparently politics are universal, even between species.""",0
"I stepped out of the shuttle pod and onto the smooth metal of the landing pad near the top of our apartment complex. My hover suitcase followed me faithfully, floating from the vehicle's rear boot before the lid closed automatically behind it. With a loud hum from its antigravity turbines, the hovercar took off, shooting off down into the city centre.
I walked across the wide landing pad, which jutted out like a chromed lily pad from the side of the elegantly curved building. My cloak rippled slightly in the breeze as the double doors slid open silently ahead of me. The thick blue carpet felt soft beneath my booted feet, and I stood there for a moment, just breathing in the familiar faint scent of vanilla that wafted up from the freshly cleaned floor.
I smiled to myself as I strolled across to the elevator, which was already waiting with its doors open, and selected my floor. A few seconds later, I was stepping out into a different corridor and walking down the hall to our apartment. I placed my palm upon the lock, which winked green and beeped. The door slid back to reveal the spacious room beyond.
I stepped through, the suitcase coming to a stop beside me and gently lowering itself to the floor.
'I'm back!' I called, shrugging off my cloak and throwing it over a nearby table. There was no reply.
'Rebecca?' I said, walking towards the short passage that led to the bedroom my girlfriend and I shared. I thought I had heard whispering a moment before, but now I could pick up no sounds coming from behind the door.
I crept up to the door, pushed it open and peered inside. My eyebrows rose in surprise.
On the wide, low bed lay my girlfriend Rebecca, with my other friend Kelly sitting with her back against the headboard on the adjacent pillow. Some sort of device lay on the covers in the centre of the bed, a sort of capsule or something. It was spherical, with tiny golden lights winking on and off inside like a swarm of trapped fireflies.
'Hey,' said Rebecca, smiling dreamily. 'You're back early.'
'What the hell are you doing?' I said, coming to the foot of the bed and looking at the capsule more closely.
Kelly and Rebecca exchanged glances. 'You tell him,' said Kelly, hugging her knees.
'Okay,' said Rebecca, looking back at me. 'Luke, have you ever heard of hive minds?'
'Hive minds?' I repeated. 'Sure.'
'Well, Kelly and I were talking about them, and we decided to research them a little. They're actually really cool, Luke!' she said excitedly, her eyes lighting up. 'People who have joined them say it's like nothing you've ever imagined. You can hear other people's thoughts, and they can hear yours, and everyone helps make each other's decisions, and—'
She stopped when she saw the look on my face.
'So what is this?' I said, pointing to the capsule.
'It's a relay,' she replied.
'A relay for what?'
'This.' She turned her head to her left, revealing a round metallic disc attached to her scalp just behind her right ear. Tiny lights flickered in it, similar to those inside the relay capsule. My eyes widened.
'I'm linked in too,' interjected Kelly, turning her head so that I could see the identical device on the side of her head. I looked back to Rebecca in disbelief.
'You two are in a *hivemind* together?' I said. 'Like, actually linked to each other?'
'And about two dozen other people,' said Kelly. 'That's what this relay is for. So we can keep in contact.'
'And you didn't think to maybe ask if I was OK with this?' I said to Rebecca. She didn't reply, but blinked a couple of times quickly. Kelly suddenly sniggered quietly.
I looked from one to the other. 'What?' I said. 'Are you two talking to each other right now?'
'Us and the rest of them, don't forget,' said Kelly. 'There's currently a bit of a debate going on as to whether she should try kissing and making up now, or let you cool off in your own time.'
I didn't bother to reply, but instead stormed from the room, slamming the door behind myself.
Neither of them followed me, but then why would they? They had found their own new little world.",0
"The singing, pinging, ringing sound that lives in side your ear
That continuous, constant, ceaseless noise is currently here
-
'There is no medication,' the doctors say, 'Live with it,' they said
'There is no magic cure for this, not medicine, not bed.'
-
'Merely a hallucination, and that cannot be fixed.'
'Just live your life, and don't, on it, be transfixed.'
-
That's easy for them to say, the doctors and the nurses
They don't have to live inside their heads with an ever-ringing circus
-
But *you* know what's it's like, you know the constant pain
You feel the pinging, always there, the noise inside your brain
-
But if you knew the reason that you hear the endless ringing
If you knew why it was really here, if you knew the nature of his singing

You wouldn't be complaining; you'd know that you're blessed
For it conceals the secret wanderings of your unknown guest
-
He latches onto you and hides behind your mind
He's chosen you to veil himself, to you to be confined

Whilst he conducts his hidden, despicable business
The events that he would not want you to witness

He makes the noise, that's him, he puts it in your ear
Because without it, you'd know that he was here

"She wakes up in stages. The light in the cottage bends along the curves of her shoulders and I wonder if there could ever be anything in the world as soft as this. The door to the patio is open and spring breezes carry in the smells of a world being reclaimed. Whatever I was thinking about is long gone. She makes a how-about-coffee kind of noise while stretching out across the bedsheets.
""Sure. Same as normal, or something different?""
""Why?""
""Well...because things are different today. You know?"" I get up and consider putting clothes on as I talk. ""This is the beginning of a whole new life for us.""
""I think—"" she clears her throat, ""that it's going to be a whole new life with the same milk, no sugar.""
""Hmm."" I'll stay naked. ""I can see this isn't going to work out then.""
She rolls over and drops her face into the pillow. Whatever she says doesn't sound very perturbed. She makes me smile so easily. I think that's the real mystery of it. Everything I've done in life and she can make me warm and fuzzy by muttering into a pillow. I'm insane. I'm in love. You have even my smile to entertain yourself with.
She bought me one of those plastic cup/single serving machines but I threw it out. That was a little testy but it's disgustingly wasteful. She conceded when I pointed out the volume of shelf space the cups take up. The relative density to traditional packages. Better, I think, just to not drink the stuff, but life is not all about efficiency. It's a balance. We respect each others' boundaries. A lot of my work seems to teach me about successful relationships—or at least the thinking about work.
I got a french press instead and, though I find myself making the coffee most of the time, I like the doing of it. There are steps, and flourishes. All the meaning in life is made—crafted. Living itself is a craft to be mastered. As I pour out hers I realize I'm daydreaming and check the time. I could miss almost anything to spend a few more hours in bed with her. Almost.
She's asleep again when I come back into the room. ""Coffee, babe."" She sits up reluctantly and takes her mug, careful not to spill it onto her chest. The image of a drip of coffee rolling down her chest as she blows steam from the cup is an incredible turn-on. She notices.
""We've got stuff to do today, no more of that.""
""I know. I was just...” I don't know what I was just. ""I'm so glad I've earned your trust.""
She sips, furrowing her brow. ""You're shit at saying romantic things.""
""Would you rather I didn't try?""
She smiles so warmly I lose my mental attempt to lose the erection. ""Hey, what time is it?""
""We've got time."" I set my drink on the bedside table and sit down. She leans over and gives me a sweet kiss on my cheek. The aroma lingers.
""Get dressed.""
She finishes the coffee and starts moving around the room, getting her clothes. My suit's already laying on the chair. I'm dressed well before she is, admiring the cut of the jacket in the bathroom mirror. I have to edge past her as I step out to let her in. I step out onto the porch and pull out a smoke. If I have to give it up, I'll at least finish the ones I have left. My watch beeps. I wish the car was here already. Probably only a few minutes out. I'm flicking the lighter when her voice comes out muffled from the bathroom.
""What?"" I pull it out of my mouth from habit.
""Where are my earrings with the red stones in them?""
""I don't know. Did you take them out?""
""I think so.""
""Well forget about them. You're just perfect as you are.""
She makes a loud puking sound but she comes out and floats around the bed to join me. The valley to the south is alive with the waves of wind that tear across the canopies, warm and dry. In the distance, on the low hills, I can see cattle grazing. There's pollen in the air. It's a smell that makes you breath greedily. My watch beeps again and I drop to my knee.
""What now?""
""I want to give you the brightest diamond in the world, but every time I found one it ended up just being another trinket. Junk for consumption.""
""This is my diamond?""
""Yes. The cleanest, purest one there is."" I remember the smoke in my hand and pop it into my pocket for a moment. ""I've given up everything for you. The whole world.""
She tries to smile warmly for me but there are tears in her eyes. They become God's own jewels as the horizon lights up. She takes me in her arms and holds me tight. ""It's perfect.""",0
"I don't usually do these often so sorry if it's bad, I just really liked the promt.:)

""So you all wanna' hear about the Angels do ya'?""
The closest child to her piped up instantly.
""Yes Nana!, Uncle Naru told us to get you to tell us about them, the angels in the stars!""
As the crowd of small children began to grow, the hushing from their soft, young voices began to unify as the smile on the elderly womans face began to widen.
""Well then,"" She began as she pushed off the blanket she was covered up in. Standing up she looked around for her stick, scanning the most likely of places she would have left her aid.
""One of you little ones best be gettin' me my stick, wherever the damn thing is..""
""Mother! Language!"" cried the lady from across the room, the device she was working with lay on the table in various pieces.
""These children are here to play, not be filled with your curses."" She said sternly, despite the slight smirk on her face.
The old lady gave a laugh. ""Sorry Juli.""
She took another scan of the room and gestured to one of the small children to a small metallic tube that lay on the floor nearby. The little one held it up like a trophy, and presented it to her. She took it and with a sharp flick of the wrist it began to deform and elongate and morph into an ornate wooden stick.
Taking a moment, she shakily took a step from the chair she stood in and walked to the center of the room. The children naturally formed into a ring around her.
She loved telling this story, and her grin probably gave that away.
""Long ago, back when all humanity lived an' breathed on mother Earth, men an' woman from all the world over would brave the challenges of the great expanse, an' would journey out in thousands of small ships that would use the power of the stars to fly great distances ta' new worlds. Do any of ya' here know the name'sa these people?""
One of the smaller children at the back raised their hand.
""Go on love"". The lady said.
""Well um, My daddy once told me about the Mur-Ed-Een heroes and about how they all flew far away to find the stuff and things we know today."" said the child.
""Yes thats it! The Meridian heros!"" said the old lady.
Whispers began to break out among the children.
""In those days, stars ships were nasty an' cramped tin cans full'a gas and flammables. An' all the food they had ta' eat was crammed in with 'em! Imagine that! Food buried ya' up to ya' eyeballs!"" She continued.
Children laughed and giggled to themselves.
The old lady hunched up her back, and lowered her voice slightly.
She really did love telling this story, she figured that she had the theatrics down to a tee.
""An' on those long an' dangerous trips, sometimes them Meridians would would come back all different like, changed men an' women, scared crazy from the things they'd seen out there.""
The whispering grew louder, and even with her dulled hearing she could hear the word 'angels' being said.
This was it, the cue she needed.
""Some a' them would come talking about, ""the Angels!""
More rapturous giggling from the crowd.
""Stories about how these great big things like you'd pull outta the oceans a' Earth with glowing bodies an' long arm like things in the hundreds flyin' right up ta' those old tin cans, stories 'bout how they had no engines or sails, but eyes an' tentacles an' thick, colorful shells that'd hypnotize a fella' if he stared too long into it.""
She wiggled her fingers at the word tentacles and twirled them at Hypnotize.
She noticed that her daughter back in the corner of the room was also watching the show, and she suddenly remembered telling her this story when she was of similar age.
Fond memories would not bring her show to a stop however.
""Some a' them folks that'd come back would say how the angels would talk to 'em, no words or writin' or nothin' but with thoughts and feelin's!"" She said, making sure to wiggle her stick carefully around a few of the children's heads.
""I remember hear'n tales from them myself from I was just a lil' girl. Long time ago mind you. Mad stories about how the angels would grab ya' ship with them tentacles and pull ya' right ta' it's great big ol' eye. An' it would scream, oh boy how'd it scream loud right into ya' head about it's 'god'. An' if ya' didn't listen', if ya' tried to run away..""
Despite the great pain of doing so, the old lady hunched her back over even more, dropping her stick to the ground and put her hands out in front of her like two great claws.
""SNAP!"" She yelled, softly pinching the noses of two of the small children.
""They'd get 'em!""
Frantic giggling broke out among the kids, now wired on the notion of space monsters eating their friends up whole. The story was over, and their energy quickly drove them out into the garden, where they soon ran out of sight.
The young lady got up from her chair across the room walked over to her Mother, helping her back into the sofa she was originally curled up in. The old lady was glad, her back now pained from excessive movement.
""You know Mother."" The daughter said as she began tucking her mother back into her chair. ""You've still never told me if those stories are true.""
The old lady took her daughters hand, and smiled.
""Truth is usually stranger than fiction love.""",0
"National Parks are a beautiful part of any nation. Yellowstone in the USA, Parque La Huasteca in Mexico, Krka in Croatia - all of them are filled with jaw dropping sights, unique in their spirit but unified in the effect they have on the observer. Spend a night observing the stars under the black skies of Snowdonia and the next night you spend in your apartment or McMansion will feel strangely crowded.
Each culture around the world shares stories about the woods, usually depicting animals that can speak, secret cultures of elves or dwarves that refuse to live with man, or trees that are wiser than even the most learned man. But each culture also shares the same story, the one that warns a wanderer not to stray from the cleared paths in the forest. The French have Little Red Riding Hood, the Germans have Hansel & Gretel, A Vava Inouva from Algeria, Lon Po Po from China; all of them share a similar theme of warning the listener to beware whatever waits just beyond the trees.
Have you ever read the original journals of Lewis and Clark? You probably haven't, there's a reason we remember them, but not a single quote from either has permeated the American national consciousness. Clark was a syphilitic, a disease which was believed to cause madness in its later stages, and Lewis fell in love with the dried Peyote roots that the Natives were so eager to trade for cloth and rifles. Their America is a different one from the one we know, a land filled with awful beasts that hunted man for sport. There is one who they describe in depth, a pale bony creature that walks upright like a man with long clawed hands that drag along the dirt, leaving a trail along the deep imprints left from hooked feet.
They called it a wendigo.
The creature appears throughout their writing, in every state they crossed through, they both wrote of scared natives who refused to lead them down easier paths, saying that these lands were where the wendigo lived. They ignored their guide once, preferring the easier crossing that a forested valley provided over hiking over another mountain, they turned back after the third skeleton they found with the jaw removed and the skull crushed in. I've read before that any animals that eats a man will eat the body in the following order: the thighs, the glutes, the fat deposits on the front of the belly, the tongue, and the brain. Lewis and Clark noticed that these people seemed to have died in reverse order, the teeth marks rarely were on the thigh bone or the tailbone, but they were always on the skull.
The strangest part about having your brain eaten is that you're alive for longer than you'd expect. Your brain is filled with redundancies for the major functions, it's the reason brain damage can cost you the ability to speak or to regulate your emotion, but your heart will keep beating. Cannibals used to believe that eating a man's brain gave you his power. There would be festivals where a man had his head placed through the center of a table, exposing only the top of the scalp. The flesh and bone would be removed with an obsidian blade, and as the sacrificed screamed underneath the table, high priests and kings would dig into their meal with polished stone spoons. I have heard before that people taste rather like pigs.
Lewis and Clark only saw the wendigo once, while they were traveling by torchlight through the green woods of western Oregon. They said they couldn't hear it, but that it appeared in the shadows of the trees, a tall and gaunt beast that would have blended in with the branches if it wasn't moving. It followed them for the full night, disappearing when they shouted and banged their pans and shot at it, but reappearing every time. The party didn't sleep until long after dawn broke, and even then, a member disappeared. They could have followed him, the screams let them know exactly where he was, but courage escaped them and eventually the noise stopped.
There have been periodic sightings of wendigos ever since. I am sure if you have any friends living west of the Mississippi, they all know someone who can speak of the shadow that moved beyond the trees, waiting. Officially, the United States government says that 11 people went missing without a trace in the woods last year. Many believe that number is much higher.",0
"**The Villa**
***
* [UNS Odessa - November 3, 2154] *
""Computer, play Beethoven.""
Tinkling piano chords filled the bridge as Captain Joseph Guerro leaned back from his console. He laced his fingers behind his head and let himself flow into the music.
They had been drifting for days, somewhere out beyond the orbit of Neptune, exactly where the mysterious message told them to wait. Normally, Joseph would have hesitated taking a private contract, but the message had included the first half of the payment.
It was enough to buy a second ship.
Joseph put his feet up on the dash, retrieved a syntharette from his pocket, and pulled the auto-lite tab. A thin line of smoke danced away across the bridge towards the vent.
He was shaken from his revelry by a shrill alarm, accompanied by a flashing red icon on the console. New message. Joseph leaned forward. ""Computer, stop music.""
He looked over his shoulder, but the bridge was empty. With a shrug, he opened the message.
*Captain Guerro, thank you for coming. Please follow the link below, we will talk soon. –E. *
The message included a link into the Net, the virtual world, the shared delusion. Guerro hated the Net; he was much more comfortable with a gun in his hand. But the pay…
""Yo Art,"" he said into the console's comm, ""we got a message, you might want to get up here.""
The comm sparked to life. ""Great, one moment captain…"" there was the unmistakable crash of falling pots, ""just gotta … get this… soufflé… ah crap."" The android had taken up cooking during the long hours of restlessness between jobs, and from the sound of it, and the taste of his past dishes, it was not a skill that came easily to those without taste buds. ""Be right there captain.""
Several minutes later the hulking android stepped onto the bridge wearing a comically-small apron and covered in flour. ""I don't think you'll want to go into the kitchen and time soon for… a reason.""
Joseph chuckled, then waved him over. ""Take a look at this, Art, what do you think?""
The android, seven feet of cerasteel armor plating, leaned over the captain's shoulder and read the message. ""Well,"" he said, ""it looks like our mysterious patron wants to meet in person… well… personally at least.""
Guerro nodded. ""Think it's safe?""
Arthur shrugged. ""Who knows. With that kinda money, whoever's waiting for you probably has some pretty beefy security, and I can't think of anybody who wants your hide that badly. And in any case, I'll be right there with you, watching the neural-feed.""
Guerro took a drag from the syntharette, mulling over the invitation. Finally, he ashed the butt and looked up at the android. ""Get me the helmet.""
***
The transition into the virtual world was uncomfortable at best, and Guerro nearly vomited as it materialized around him. He could feel the reassuring weight of the neural headband, a comforting reminder that none of this was real.
With a deep breath, he opened his eyes.
Guerro had spent a decent amount of time flitting around the Net, chasing down wannabe hackers, number runners and the like, but he had never seen anything like this.
Instead of the traditionally gaudy and impossible landscapes of the main haunts, Joseph stood in a garden, overlooking the ocean. He could smell the salt air, feel the breeze on his cheek, hear birds chirping in a nearby olive tree.
""Wow…"" Arthur said, his disembodied voice drifting on the wind, ""quite the set-up, must have cost a fortune."" Joseph nodded, and looked around. He was on a terraced hillside among a meticulously manicured garden. The ocean swelled out before him, dotted by delicate sea spires. He turned around, and saw, at the top of the hill, a scene out of a historical documentary.
""It's a villa, sir,"" Arthur said in his ear, ""early Spanish, I believe. Note the red clay ti…"" Joseph waved him away. ""Mansion. Got it.""
A floating green arrow appeared several feet down the garden path, pointing towards the villa. With a shrug, Joseph followed the guide.
As he neared the villa, the sound of revelry filled the garden, music and laughter. Must be a party, he thought. Wonder who it's for.
The floating green arrow drifted across a bright green lawn, terminating at a set of gigantic carved wooden doors. The music was pounding now, and he could hear the footfalls and laughter of what must have been hundreds of dancers. Joseph reached out, but they swung open before him.
As the doors opened the music stopped. Joseph stepped into a massive vaulted dance hall, far larger than the villa appeared from the outside. And it was empty, save for a single table, set in the center beneath a handing chandelier.
There was a creature sitting on the table.
""You see this, Art?"" Jospeh asked under his breath.
""Indeed, sir. It appears to be a fox, relative to the common canine. They were hunted to extinction in the early twenty first century.""
""A fox, huh? Never heard of ‘ em.""
Joseph took another step into the villa, and the fox perked up. It watched him approach with beady green eyes. The light from the chandelier seemed to flow across its red fur.
As Joseph approached the table the fox, in a red-orange blur, leapt to the ground and circled the captain. Joseph held his breath. Something about the fox unnerved him.
Finally, after completing several inquisitive passes, the fox leapt back onto the table.
""Good morning, Captain Guerro, so good of you to join me.""
Before his eyes, the fox twisted and grew, morphed into the very visage of beauty. There, seated on the table, sat a lithe young woman, red hair falling like flame down her shoulders. Guerro said nothing.
The woman held his gaze, her penetrating green eyes boring into his soul. Then she spoke.
""I'm sure you are wondering why I summoned you, captain?"" Joseph nodded, but remained silent.
""Ah, the strong silent type…"" The woman rose from the table, her hair dancing in impossible patterns as she moved. ""Very much the wolf, I see your reputation is well-suited.""
""The wolf?"" Joseph asked, skepticism filling his voice. He had not heard that nickname in a very long time...
The woman stepped closer, ran a delicate finger down Guerro's chest. ""The hunter, the shadow, the...killer.""
Reaching the end of his patience, Guerro brushed her hand aside. ""You call me here to kill someone? That's not exactly my cup of tea.""
The woman giggled, high and musical. ""Oh, my dear wolf, don't be modest. If you were not the right… tool for this job, you would not be here. Now, can I offer you something to eat? Drink?""
Joseph shook his head. ""Just tell me what you want me to do.""
The woman cast a mischievous grin. ""Straight and to the point, little wolf. As you wish. Follow me.""
The woman spun, her hair flying in an auburn wave, and she strode back into the deeper gloom of the voluminous dance hall. Joseph looked around, shrugged, and followed.
The woman led him deeper into the villa, past doors and alcoves, staircases and galleries. Whomever had designed this virtual world had paid excruciating attention to detail, and Joseph found himself captivated by the murals and busts adorning the walls. He recognized a few.
The woman stopped at a small set of plain white doors, turned, and beckoned him through.
Joseph stepped through the doors, and into chaos.
It was an alleyway, late at night, and rain fell in sheets. Joseph stood, transfixed, staring at the scene before him. The woman walked up beside him, lacing her arm through his. ""Recognize anything, little wolf?""
There was a crowd gathered under a flickering neon sign, roiling, shoving to get a better view. Joseph floated across the pavement, dreading what he was about to see.
As he approached the crowd faded, and he was looking at a man, crouched on the pavement, blood covering his overcoat.
It was Captain Joseph Guerro.
""No…"" he muttered, watching his digital self cradle the broken body of a girl, indistinguishable in the dim light.
""Yes…"" the woman purred in his ear, ""my wolf, do you remember that night?""
Joseph remembered vividly. He remembered it frequently. His stomach knotted.
""I… I'm so sorry… I tried to help…""
The woman pulled him tighter as they both watched the scene unfold. The digital memory of Guerro carefully rose, holding the body in his arms. He turned as the phantom image of Arthur came dashing into the alley, missing his left arm and limping heavily.
""I know.""
The alley dissolved into a blinding white light. As Guerro's eyes adjusted, the woman was standing before him, but her face had changed, into one that sent Guerro's mind reeling back through the years.
Joseph felt the breath drain from him.
""Susan...what...what do you want me to do?"" Guerro managed to ask.
The woman placed a cold, digital hand against his cheek.
""Avenge me, my wolf.""

"Ryder sighed as he appeared in a familiar ivory white kitchen. He sighed once more when he saw the reason he was there, standing on her tiptoes, trying to reach for a new packet of flour in the too cabinet. ""Got you,"" he heard her whisper as she barely held the item. ""There is such thing as a chair, Karen,"" he spoke up, giving the petite girl a fright and dropping the flour on top of her head. Ryder pressed his lips together, trying his best to stifle his laugh. ""You! This is all your fault!"" Karen said exasperatedly, as she shook flour out of her hair. Ryder picked up a kitchen towel on his way towards her and gently wiped her face clean, ""it's been years, Karen. You should be used to it by now. I don't have any control over it remember."" Karen held his wrist, stopping him from helping any further, ""i'm sorry. Always am. I couldnt help but unconsciously wished you were here."" She turned around and started to clean the mess. Before he could say anything else, Karen had asked, ""what were you doing this time around?"" ""With Lana."" Karen stopped her cleaning, her body tensed up at his girlfriend's name. She quickly stood up, heading towards her room, ""sorry again. You can leave and do whatever I interrupted. I'm just going to clean up first."" ""Karen..."" Ryder called out but she had already dashed into her room. He sighed for the 3rd time that hour.
They dated, they broke up, dated again before finally breaking up once more. But even then, they remained best friends thanks to Aphrodite's little trick. No mattwr how much they tried to stay away from each other, Karen would unconsciously end up needing him, making him appear right before her. This continued to happen even after they had their own partners.
However, Michael, who has been with Karen for almost 1 year, could not take it anymore when Ryder had arrived at the hospital before him during ing Karen's accident a month back. It was not that critical, but to see another guy holding your unconscious girlfriend's hand was just the last straw for Michael. 2 weeks later he broke it off.
Ryder closes his eyes as he felt his body being transported once more. Hearing the quiet sobs made his heart wrenched. He opened his eyes to see Karen with her head down, knees hugged tightly against herself. He kneeled down beside the bathtub, and places a comforting hand to Karen's head. ""you missed a spot,"" he whispered. Her head came up, eyes brimming with unshed tears as she looked at him, ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to."" Ryder gave a small smile as he moved his hand to her cheek, wiping any visible tear stain, ""I broke up with Lana."" Karen fel her breath stop as she tried to grasp his meaning. Ryder continued to smile softly, ""Lana, Jenny, Rachael..or whoever comes before and after...no one can be compared with you, Karen. There's just something about them, that you have and they don't. """"and what is that?"" Karen asked quietly, as fresh tears started to fall.
""My heart,"" he whispered as he leaned in for her lips.",0
"""You hit me in the leg, you git!"" I turned the corner to the sound of Ron shouting, and the sight of him hopping around on one leg while the other flailed around uselessly like an empty sock. ""If that's how we're going to play it..."" he leveled his wand at Harry and shouted ""Animata!,"" a spell that would make Harry dance around like a madman.... if aimed properly. Instead, the flash of blue light arced over Harry's shoulder and hit me straight in the chest.
""RON!"" I screamed. Static electricity filled the air, causing my hair to poof up even more than usual.
""Blimey, Hermione!"" Ron shouted, victorious grin changing to a look of horror. ""Hey, why aren't you dancing around?"" He looked at his wand, still covered in Spell-o-tape from when they'd hit the Whomping Willow. ""Ruddy piece of junk!""
It wasn't the wand, though. Energy was pulsing from the device in my pocket that had absorbed the blow. The Time Turner, that Dumbledore had made me *swear* not to tell anyone about. ""I've got to go!"" I shouted, ducking out of the room.
""That was weird,"" I heard Ron mutter as the door slammed shut.
I reached into my pocket to check on the hourglass that I'd been using to get to all of my classes on time this year. Electricity coursed through my veins, and the glass actually shattered. ""I'd better clean up all this sand,"" I thought just as my vision went black and I passed out on the hallway floor.
----
The sun was in my eyes. *What time was it? Why was I asleep already? *
I bolted upright. *Oh god! I missed Runes class! All because of Ron and that stupid spell! *
Hogwarts, however, was gone. I was in the right *place*: I recognized the lake, the Forbidden Forest, everything. But where the castle should have been, there was a herd of cattle grazing in an empty field. A lone shepard sat nearby, enjoying a picnic and very surprised to see me.
""Pardon me,"" I asked him, ""But where...""
He interrupted me, in Latin. ""I'm sorry, young lady, but I can't understand you.""
*Latin? * Thank god that Mum and Dad had sent me to that Catholic school back when I was living as a Muggle!
I tried my best to respond. ""Can you please tell me where we are?""
""Eburacum,"" he said. ""Where did *you* come from, though?""
I ignored his question. *Eburacum? * that had been the *Roman* name for this area!
With a sudden realization of horror, I pulled out the shattered remains of the Time Turner. Ron's Animate spell had caused it to go haywire, and apparently sent me all the way back to Ancient Rome. And repairing such an object...I'd need to find the wizarding community in this time. I thought back to my History of Magic notes, which I'd memorized for the final.
""Who is Emperor, sir?"" I asked the shepard.
He held up a shiny coin. ""Emperor Marcus Aurelius, of course. Are you all right, girl?""
""Y...yes,"" I answered slowly. *Marcus Aurelius*! He had been the only Wizard Emperor of Rome, and a powerful alchemist to bat! If I was going to find a new time turner, I might as well start there!
""You've been very helpful, sir,"" I told the shepard. ""Could you please direct me to the nearest village?""
He pointed down toward where Hogsmeade was in my time. I bowed and took off down the hill. Somewhere down there, I'd be able to find civilization, and maybe even some wizards. And if I was *really* lucky, wizards with a broom that could take me to Rome.",0
"I wonder if my soul understands the idea of birthdays. A questionable assumption I have asked myself many times. Indeed, a poignant question to ask oneself on the day of their namesake. But not very odd, if you knew what we did. What we possessed.
Speaking of possession. What a scary word if you think of the cinematic definition. Of a body overcome by a demon that usually speaks the Latin tongue, and I say tongue because in the movies that's a plot device to make said demon seem a bit more dramatic. In reality it made a good case for a corrupt loony bin doctor to subscribe one of those seven days a week pill box to you. But what if it wasn't out of the realm of impossible. Nor strictly a Christian motivation. This body stealing capability.
Isn't anything possible in the multiverse? Believe me, I never thought of quantum physics when we stumbled on this ability-that I necessarily consider science either. We were a bunch of fourteen year old guys (give or take.) Clearing our minds in what came to dub ""meditation"" that freed us from a rough daily reality.
Spirit jumping a hundred years into the future, sometimes a thousands years in the past. Exorcisms? Lobotomies? Virtual reality? Some questions don't have simple answers. If only it was easy to explain to an outsider, the assassination of a warlord by a group of field mice.
I think about it on weird days like this one. As the hands of a giant of a nurse shoves horse pills down my throat. Before my mind flutters away on wings of medicated insanity as usual. Yet, just as this character assassin hands me a paper solo cone of water to wash another year away. It finally dawns on me that it's my birthday. Solemnly looking out the window at the sky, and courtyard, and the bright green grass shiny with dew.
As my mind melts away. I people watch one last time.
The cute nurse taking a smoke break in the courtyard. A boy holding his mother's hand as they walk towards the entrance. A few People exiting vehicles parked off the side of the road. One making awkward gestures and hand motions as they stand in a wide huddle together. Before they finally start to walk in a small party, crossing through the grass towards the hospital. Their feet leaving dark prints as they move closer and closer.
My stomach flips upside down as if it decided to start a cycle of rejecting the pills. Then a long forgotten, boyish rush of adrenaline pulses through my spine before it expands into my extremities. That is when the realization occurs:
It's a birthday party.",0
"I remember the day like it was yesterday. The day when humanity inexplicably found the Gift, and then blinked itself to extinction. Well, actually, it was yesterday. Walking along the street on my way to Joe's Neighborhood Pizzeria and Ribs, I was wearing my usual short order cook outfit, all decked out in white. By the time I reached the restaurant, it was soaked in blood. The restaurant's owner was named Joe like me, but that wasn't his real name. His real name was Akimoto, but he figured Akimoto's Pizzeria and Sushi Bar wouldn't have the same ring to American ears and palate. So he became Joe.
I rounded a corner to a street that was a block away from Times Square. But it was deserted and eerily quiet which any New Yorker will tell you is impossible even at 2 AM. I stood there gape-mouthed on the sidewalk. That was a mistake. Before I could close it again, my mouth was full of blood. Other people's blood. You see, it became a sport to tease the only human on Earth without the Gift.
A street punk materialized before me. He sported the typical punk leather outfit complete with purple mohawk and something I hadn't ever seen before: a red line tattoo around his neck with little drops of blood attached. The tattoo artists of the day were getting uncannily realistic I thought. He had this odd expression on his face like he wanted to tell me something. His mouth opened and mouthed something silently. I'd like to think it was ""Hello, Joe, what a bitchin'fine day, eh?"" But a part of me, my gut instinct, sensed that it was more like ""Oh my fucking god, I'm going to die!"" That and the terror in his eyes. The wrinkled 50-odd year old looking face didn't seem to match the flamboyant outfit or hairdo. Before I could react, his head slipped off the stump of his neck like butter sloshing around on a hot pan. I caught a glimpse of his attacker, an older Japanese lady wielding a Samurai sword. She wiped her sword clean, nodded, then blinked out of existence. A sudden flash of red and blue lights announced the arrival and disposal of the corpse by some ghostly paramedic squad. And just as quickly, all that remained was a faint red smear on the sidewalk.
Pretty soon I became numb to the horrendous and gruesome ways a human body could be dispatched. So they added sex and other bodily excretions to the mix. Look, I'm as open minded as the next New Yorker, but I really don't need to see bowling balls falling out of asses more than once on an empty sidewalk.
By the time I reached the restaurant, I had witnessed no fewer than 600 murders, several dozen suicides, and more bowling balls than I could shake a stick at. The actual numbers were probably astronomically worse since I kept my eyes glued shut as much as I could. At one point, I had panicked and started running back to my apartment, but corpses and bowling balls gleefully sprang into existence in that direction, too. So with nobody home with whom to commiserate, I glumly forged ahead to the restaurant hoping beyond hope that Akimoto was there and possessed all his extremities intact.
Where Joe's Neighborhood Pizzeria and Ribs once stood was a new gleaming business called Akimoto's Guns and Sushi. Business seemed so brisk that there was no need for a door. All around me were wisps of humanity: split-second ghostly glimpses accompanied by a shimmering buzzing sound that sounded almost human. The front desk was empty as was the rest of the interior. Further in were a myriad of dangerous guns and swords in glass display cases. The other side of the large room contained a fine dining establishment.
An older and wiser Akimoto instantly materialized behind the desk.
""Joe! I've been waiting decades for you to get here!""
""What the hell is going on, Akimoto? People are being fucked and murdered, sometimes in the other order, in front of me!""
Akimoto nodded knowingly.
""Believe it or not, you're the longest running and most popular reality TV show in the whole world! There is a whole security contingent assigned to you. More than even the New World President!""
""Why would I need security? And what happened to your accent?""
""Well, some fans can be rather zealous. And the wonders of modern nano science!""
""What happened to the pizzeria? Where is everybody?""
""Look, I don't have much time myself. The New World Government promised me security and monetary reimbursement for the decade I'm wasting while talking to you. All I can tell you is that the Gift lets everybody slow down time outside their frame. Basically, we are operating at near luminal velocity. We can't stop time completely, of course, due to the speed of light being invariant in all frames of reference, but relativity causes..""
I interrupted him, ""Now you're speaking Japanese to me. Why is everybody so old?""
""As I was saying. Einstein's theory of relativity normally ages the twin traveling through space near C, the speed of light, but we Gifted ones are actually traveling through time near C thus shrinking space. The entirety of humanity now operates at this level whether desired or not. The Gifted who live life at your speed risk an easy murder or worse. They don't have your security detail.""
""Why the weapons, Akimoto?""
""Humans have been, and always will be a blood-thirsty race,"" Akimoto offered.
A heavily armed military official blinked into existence next to Joe and whispered in his ear. They both blinked out of existence. Then a minute later, a much older Joe appeared before me.
""This is it. This is the end. We discovered too late that the Gift sterilizes its users. The whole world is at war with itself! There is nothing but anarchy. You need to hide. Your detail will protect you as long as they can! You're our last hope!"" Joe breathlessly informed me.
""How the hell can I hide from these freaks?! What do you mean last hope?""
""I don't know. All I can tell you is… RUN!!!""
With that, Joe's body separated into uncountable pieces as though sliced and diced with many sharp blades. Another heavily armed and armored body near me fell. Undoubtedly one of my protectors.
I had no idea how I could hide, so I did what Joe told me, and I ran. I ran as hard and as fast as I could. All around me, bodies fell by the dozens and hundreds and thousands. There were so many that what started as a gentle slope climb over dozens of bodies turned into a nightmarish ascent over an Everest of corpses stacked so high I didn't need to use to stairs to reach my 6th story apartment. Climbing through an open window, I slammed it closed and locked it for whatever little good it would do. I crawled into bed, pulled the covers over me, and cried myself to sleep. One by one, my protectors fell with a thud around my bed.
That was yesterday, and now I am utterly alone. The silence is truly deafening. As I mope in bed with my face buried in my pillow, I hear something. Someone. Beside me in the bed. Turning my head, I see a young girl roughly my age. She smiles at me, but I can see the sadness infused throughout her being. She tells me she was born during my sleep, and that we are the last humans alive.",0
"""For the last time, I don't know what number you're thinking of""
""Come on"" said the prison guard
""This has to be some sort of hate crime"" said the prisoner to himself then to the guard ""Also for the last time, a medium talks to ghosts, they don't know what you're thinking""
""Wait really?""
""Yes""
""How was I supposed to know that""
""Because I kept telling you""
""So how do you make someone a medium""
""Wait you thought getting me to guess the number you're thinking of would make me a medium""
""Does it not?""
""Again it would be psychic and no""
""So what makes a medium?""
""What makes someone able to talk to be an intermediary with the dead?""
""Yeah""
""Nothing""
""Really?""
""Yes""
""What about a near death experience?""
""Some people seem to think so""
""Hmm…""
The guard walked off.
""Why did I tell him that.""
The guard came back.
""Where did you get a bucket so fast…wait""
""Open the cell""
""No no no""
The guard threw the water on the prisoner.
""For the last time I don't melt in water, that's not even a stereotype…oh shit it's learning"" said the prisoner as the guard tased him.

The prisoner came to on a stretcher being pushed down the hall, a see through figure floating ahead of him.
""Can see ghosts yet?"" said the guard
""Nope"" said the prisoner
""Dick"" said the floating apparition
""I knew it""
""Wait can you see this ghost?""
""Ha tricked you""
""I didn't think you were that smart""
""I'm not I tested the water taser thing on myself to see if it work""
""Where did you even find the time for that""
""I don't know""
""Stop he's got the prisoner"" said a voice behind them.
The guard picked up speed.
""What are we doing"" said the prisoner
""Don't worry about it"" said the guard, before pushing the stretcher through a set of doors.
""I'd like to go back to my cell now"" said the prisoner
""Be free"" said the guard
""No no no"" said the prisoner as the guard gave the stretcher a shove.
The prisoner turned around to see the guard with his hand out stretched.
""May the wind be ever at your back"" he said before gun fire erupted behind him. The guard jerked as blood flew from his torso. He collapsed to the ground, then lifted his head, held out his hand and said ""go""
The prisoner turned around as the stretcher picked up speed. He had forgotten the prison was on a hill. The stretcher rolled towards the front gate.
""Oh good"" said the prisoner.
The stretcher broke through the gate and continued down the hill.
""Why does this prison have such shitty security"" the prisoner yelled as he and the stretcher rolled towards the busy road at the bottom of the hill.",0
"The words ""colony collapse"" have taken on a whole new meaning over the last few months, it started with the bees, and that was weird enough for most people, mass populations of bees dropping out of the air, so many crops lost because we had no way to pollinate them, mass starvation even in wealthy western countries. Of course there was also the cotton shortage, it still amazes me that with everything else going on, people were hit so hard by that. A third of the Earth's population in jeopardy of starving to death, and what is everyone freaking out about?, the scarcity of designer skinny jeans,...spawned quite the black market trade for awhile.
Of course as an Environmental Etymologist this was no surprise to me, I've been studying bee die-offs for 15 years. I tried to sound the warning bell, we all did, endless research papers, conference talks, even the occasional radio or television interview, but by the time the message was taken seriously, it was already too late.
The tipping point was NOSOI inc., their new range of pesticides promised a much more cost effective way to control Aphid populations, however after later investigations it was revealed that testing indicated a possible high risk for exposure, and toxicity to bee populations too. After years of expensive research and development, NOSOI had too much riding on their new product line to let it be shut down by regulations, so they buried the research and released the product.
Within three months almost all the bee colonies within the Continental US, mainland Europe, China, and Russia were dead, food prices soared, and the global economy collapsed.
As bad as it was, this was all within our expectations for a mass colony collapse scenario, what we didn't expect was what happened next, thousands of people worldwide started dying from an as yet unclassified neurological disorder, confusion, loss of control of motor-function, quickly followed by death.
The truly incredible part, was not how many people were dying, or how they were dying, but *who* was dying. Politicians, Wall Street CEOs, high ranking Police and Military, Silicon Valley tech billionaires, even some religious leaders and cultural figures, literally everyone who died from Morel's syndrome was a notable figure in business, politics or culture.
Some of my colleagues were even asked to consult of a few autopsy reports. Who would you call if you found a three inch seed-shaped mass in the prefrontal cortex of almost every major influential figure on earth?",0
"Bill slammed the empty shotglass upside down on the counter. ""Seriously! They never talk about how much...Ummm...Paperwork! Yeah! And shouting! They never mention that in the pamphlet!"" He reached over the floating counter top and grabbed another green bag from the shelf. After uncapping the top, the liquid slowly slid out and splashed into another shotglass in his hand. The counter bobbed down slowly as Bob dropped the bag on it. ""I signed up to go see the sights and meet new cultures! Not to get stuck in an office signing contracts and making ads! Paper after paper after- ugh- paper...Meeting the president even gets boring after the 20th time! So many questions that we had answered in our report months ago! You never realize how much people don't read until you do something abnormal. They always want to ask the same question but hear the answer from you!""
Bill had forgotten that he was still holding the glass and his angry arm waving sent tiny orbs of the green liquid onto uniform of the person next to him. Aweah'jebe didn't notice though. His head was thumping and he was slumped over on the counter. He made a series of gurgling and clicking noises. From a band around his neck came a humming and then the translated message:
""I know what you mean! Even here! Our overlords- burp- put tons of pressure on us. We haven't even left our own planet! We've just been chilling here entertaining you. We're a welcoming committee! It's a good time going out and drinking and picking up girls but-""
""Yeah! Despite the gills, the green skin, and the really big eyes, the girls here are pretty dang good looking!""
""Oh yeah, definitely. Just wait until they legalize cross-species marriage! Your gravity is so much worse. You can do crazy things here. I can't imagine doing it with a girl so heavy and so slowly...Ummm...What was I- Oh right! What I don't understand is how- ugh- you're drinking me under the table so easily!""
""Probably that dang gravity again. Alcohol just floods in and out on Earth. Here, the alcohol chills in your blood for such a long time! Your kidneys barely have the work and the good times last so much longer! Which reminds me: Here is another shot!""",0
"To drown in blood is a terrifying prospect.
Vlad watched the storage tank shake left and right as the boy inside shook helplessly against his death. The tank was made of pure bronze and hung vertically from the ceiling. It wasn't see-through, though Vlad could imagine what it was like to die in there very well. He had done it himself, after all. The tank stopped rattling.
The middle-aged man waited patiently, arms folded. It was a common trick to stop struggling in an attempt to appear you've died, when in reality you wait for the tank to open. Another shake, weaker than before. Vlad smiled.
It was good, the fight in the boy. It meant he would make a great addition to the ranks.
He walked over and stepped on the footholds, opening the top latch of the tank. He reached one arm in and grabbed the boy, pulling him out with ease. The limp body was barely 100 pounds, even soaking wet with blood.
Vlad put the boy down and extended his right finger-nail into a claw. He aimed at the boy's left breast and thrust his arm forward. A thin tube-like hole brought air to his heart.
The boy's eyes snapped open, now yellow, and he took a deep breath, though honestly, it was unnecessary. Breathing was a tough habit to break.
""Welcome,"" Vlad said with a broad smile. ""Welcome to the Brotherhood.""
The boy said nothing, instead looking around in wild movements of the pupil.
""Thirsty?"" Vlad asked, holding out a pouch of blood.
The boy took it hungrily and ripped it open, not caring for any of the sweet liquid spilled.
Yes, Vlad thought, he would make a *great* addition.",0
"""Well.. what do you think?"" I slowly come to the realization that my new wispy-tailed pal is still here, seemingly gazing right through me. I had been staring at his tapered body, entranced by the way it wagged around like a tail. I swear every time this ""tail"" starts ""wagging"" near my brother's bong my heart skips a beat.
""About what?"" I ask, giving zero thought into what he is saying.
""Jesus man, stay with me. I was asking about your first wish..."" After no response, he waves his hand in front of my face. ""Anybody in there?""
My gaze slowly shifts to the genie. ""I don't know man, I'm sorry. This is my first time smoking pot and I'll be honest, I am trippin' out.""
""Oh, shit!"" He blurts out. I jolt up and starting glancing around. ""No, it's nothing. That's just kind of a lot for your first time. It's cool though, you're fine don't get paranoid.
""Okay, ""I pause. ""Has anyone ever died from smoking too much?""
""Dude stop you're fine. And you're freaking me out. What's your wish?"" He looks at me expectantly.
""Uhh. Okay. Can the wishes all be the same?"" I'm starting to think up a plan, and feeling real clever about myself in the process.
The genie chuckles to himself. ""No that's dumb.""
""Well then I wish that they could. And I want to use them all on this wish.""
That thoroughly confuses both of us, and we spend the next hour trying to figure out whether or not I have any wishes left. Eventually, the conversation comes to a halt, and we just sit and stare at my lava lamp until I fade into a deep sleep.
I wake up. The genie is gone. In my morning daze, I start to wonder if he was ever even there...",0
"*Good thing I just finished with Fullmetal Alchemist, otherwise I would have had to look these up. *
""So, babe, these are my friends,"" Casey said to his girlfriend, Monica.
A fat man gnawed on a chicken leg, sticking out a single greasy hand.
""Nice to meet you,"" Bob said. ""You smell good. Reminds me of the smell of an apple for some reason. Actually, carmel apples sound pretty darn good right now.""
Monica grabbed a napkin off the wrought-iron table and wiped her hand off. She shivered a bit, disgusted by the grease that had been on there.
She watched a man standing a far ways away, talking to some woman and acting like she wasn't even there.
""Don't mind Andrew,"" Casey told her. ""He's, well he's a bit special. He won't greet you unless you greet him first. He seriously needs to grow up.""
""Alright,"" Monica replied hesitantly, not really sure what to make of that.
""I love those shoes,"" Lisa remarked, walking over to them. ""And that dress. So beautiful.""
""Thanks,"" Monica replied, finally not disgusted by one of his friends. That was until she ran her hands a little too seductively over Casey's body. Casey, in the meantime, had a dumb smile on his face, completely ignorant of what was happening. Typical, Monica thought. Just like a man to not even realize that a woman was practically throwing herself at them.
""Actually, we should probably take a seat over there with my other friends,"" Casey said, looking over towards the couple sitting at a table a few feet away. ""It's their engagement party after all.""
""You're going to get the bill, right?"" Bill said as Casey and Monica sat down. To Monica's surprise, he was completely serious.
""You are one cheap bastard, aren't you?"" Casey replied with a wry smile.
""He sure is, and thrifty too,"" Jenna added. ""Of course, when he sees something he wants, he wastes all of his money on it. I swear, my fiancé has zero impulse control.""
The day went on, and Monica was enjoying herself. Bill and Jenna were a surprisingly delightful couple to hang out with. She didn't particularly care for the fact that Greed sneakily swept the silverware into Jenna's purse, but she overlooked it. He seemed like a nice, fun guy.
""Did you know we used to date,"" Jenna told Monica later that night at Casey's home. Casey and Bill were out on an errand.
""You and Casey?"" Monica replied innocently.
""Yep,"" Jenna smiled. She moved closer to Monica. Suddenly she was leaning in, her hands on Monica's face, pulling her into a kiss.
Monica almost fought it. She really did. But a fire ignited in her. The thrill of getting away with such a thing, right under everyone's noses at that, kept her hooked. Her lips had barely touched Jenna's when the front door swung open and the guys walked in. She expected them to be irate. But they smiled and cheered. The sudden desire was gone, but now Jenna was making out with her, all to the pleasure and applause of the men standing there.
After a few seconds they stopped and the men went into the kitchen.
""Another time, perhaps without these pesky men,"" Jenna whispered seductively.
Monica was going to tell her no, but then Bill came out and suddenly that fire, that passion for Jenna, burned in her again. She smiled a wicked smile and gave Jenna a wink.
As Casey and Monica said goodbye, walking back to Casey's car, a large man ran up and hit Casey straight in the jaw. He kept hitting him.
""Stop!"" Monica yelled, not realizing that was Ben, her exboyfriend.
""We're best friends, how could you?"" Ben yelled.
""Sorry, I guess?"" Casey said. ""Come on, you don't care that much, do you?""
""I just wanted to beat you up I guess,"" Ben said.
As he walked away, Monica was left speechless. In fact, she didn't say anything all the way back to Casey's house. He definitely had some weird friends. She still found herself thinking about Jenna, even though she would be marrying Casey in only a week.
As they walked up to the front door, a man was laid back against it, snoring.
""Dan, wake up you lazy ass!"" Casey shouted. The man stirred, then slowly extended a hand to Monica.
""Dan's the name,"" he said. ""Sorry about being late. I guess I'll get going now.""
Dan got up and slowly staggered his way away from the house. He practically seemed drunk.
""There's one last thing,"" Casey said as they settled in bed.
""What?"" Monica asked, thoughts of Jenna running through her mind. It took her a second to see the flames radiating from Casey's side of the bed. She let out a large scream as she saw him, deformed with red skin, horns sticking out of his head.
""Honey,"" he said in a deep, demonic voice. ""I'm horny.""

Saw the fleet moving weeks ago. I wouldn't be surprised.
They really did it. They really did it.
Is this the start of WWIII?
Wow. My phone was chirping and it woke me up to this.
I'm in Hong Kong right now. I'm hearing some scattered gunfire. I think about twenty planes have flown past my apartment, though.
Asian Union has released a statement. They're calling for general war on China.
I'm near an airbase in Japan. Sounds like aircraft are taking off.
You have been banned from /r/Pyongyang.
Well, the norks have had it coming for a long time.
You have been banned from /r/Pyongyang.
Wow. Wow. I hope I don't get drafted, here in the US.
Fox has an update. Saudis have declared war in Iran. Israel has declared official neutrality.
I wonder if Russia will join in?
Russians just did a press release. They're invading Manchuria and North Korea.
Anybody got a guess on how long the countries under attack will hold out?
Not too long, I think. China has a hopelessly
obsolete military, and the Federation is very
well equipped. Toss in the AU nations and
we're in for a curb stomp.
Why, though? Why would they want to invade
China? We're a decent enough country. Will
anyone help?
Who knows. Europeans are the last major
power to throw their hat in, here. I don't
think that the US will intervene.
Guys, the President released a statement. He's saying that we are going to remain neutral.
Reports coming in that North Korea is rushing the South Koreans.
Guys, I just heard on the radio that someone set off a nuke! Plz confirm.
Well, I guess this was the wrong day to move to Shanghai.
Well, I guess this was the wrong day to move to Tokyo.
Well, I guess this was the wrong day to move to the Phillipines.
EU has released a statement condemning the attacks. They're mobilizing their forces.
UK mobilizing forces. Border closed, and aircraft grounded.
FoA claims that they've taken Inchon and Hong Kong, and have landed a large force on Hainan.
I'm in Beijing. The internet is starting to cut out. I'm hearing explosions near the government buildings.
Good luck to any redditors in affected countries!
Assuming that all AU nations, the FoA, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and EU+UK are under threat, that constitutes about half of Reddit.
That's a lot of luck.
Today was the wrong day to move to Seoul.

"My name is Joshua Jerky. I am an actor that is employed by the government to ""work"" at Nevada Test Site more commonly known by its illuminati pseudonym Area 51. I just drive to the secret base and make it look shit is happen when it really isn't. My employer told me we do this, because it prevents from the actual illuminati to take of the world. I'm not quite sure what this means. However, I do feel like we at Area 51 are illuminati.
What my co-workers and I do is basically nothing, so we just goof off and send some made up sci-fi bull shit to the history channel. Believe or not, they took it and made it into a real show! The history channel really liked our stuff, so they hired us while on the job at Area 51. We became billionaires by the end of that year.",0
"For me, I think, I often have a few themes in it:

"In the early days these so called ""heroes"" just couldn't compete. Most challengers were a joke that I would casually smack back to the previous checkpoint. They would feebly try to regroup and formulate a new strategy, but even the best and brightest among them simply weren't fast enough, smart enough, or strong enough to cut it. Word of my prowess began to spread. This was my moment of glory, until something happened that I never expected. People were getting upset with me. Apparently kicking ass isn't fun for the person on the receiving end. Not exactly a revelation, but what was I supposed to do, not kick ass? The powers that be were beginning to reassess my future. But I was fortunate, I was one of the few who was around early enough to have friends with their ear to the ground. They passed along the whispers to me, gave me a heads up about what was coming. It went against every fiber of my being, but I knew that I had to start letting my opponents win.
It used to make me so upset, so depressed. I started to think that my life was entirely pointless, one long string of little twerps who came in here all cocky, wearing their flashy fucking gear. I couldn't do anything but make it look like a good fight, make them think that they earned it. At the end of the day, it was just me falling on my sword. But I realized that's how you survive. That's how you get to respawn and fight the next punk in line. The alternative is to let the gods, devs as they call themselves, purge you from the world. Or even worse, they will let you live, but nerf you so badly that you become impotent, unable to withstand even the most meager opponent. That would be a pain worse than death, at least now when I am defeated I know that it was my choice.
Before I understood this reality, I used to squeeze the most out of every moment of down time that I had. If I wasn't crush some pipsqueak, I was pumping iron or surfing Amazon.boss (sorry, it's invite only) for my next diabolical weapon. Now I just sit here, replaying my copy of the Orange Box. I have to be the hero sometimes, right? Now I have nothing better to do while I wait for the next twerp to come along and think that he (or she, apparently girls like games too now) whooped me fair and square. I just hope that Valve throws me a bone and releases the sequel that I have been waiting nearly 9 million respawns for (eight years in the real world) before I fade into obscurity.",0
"Every morning at exactly 7am, I went into the village to follow through with the obligations of the day. However, everyday at 7am, I was walking into a different village than I had the day before. You see, I travel from village to village to sell...well, whatever it is I have accumulated over my journeys. Louise LeCrow-the-free-lance-salesman! That's me. While I sell my various treasures, I get to know the needs and the desires of the people. I take note of and memorize their personalities as an investigator takes down data. Over the years, I've come to realize that in a village, there are basic types of individuals: the low-life's, the big-wigs, and the busy bodies. I avoid these people once they've bought what they need. I delete them from my memory like a file being tossed into the garbage bin. However, within each town there are real genuine people. I learn about them and in turn they ask for nothing but the opportunity to learn about me. These are the people that make all the travelling worth it. These are the people I collect for I'd be a fool to delete their files.",0

My first immolation,

"""Shit,"" I muttered. I woke up late for work again today. My paranoia has been settling in recently. My eyes remain glued to the television for hours watching the news every day. I'm losing sleep over it. The Russians have flooded to us here in the U.S. and China has claimed Antarctica, shipping missiles over to it, to presumably launch from should anything trigger a nuclear response from them.
The Russians have been coming over in droves for about twenty years now. There has been a resource crisis going on for five. Do they know something?
I hopped in my car to go to work and turned on the radio. On the highway I hit traffic, of course. Dead stop. The radio gets an interruption with an emergency broadcast. The Russians have began isolated attacks in the U.S.
Now I don't know if I'm sitting in traffic or fear.
I put down my window and peek out to see if I can see anything causing this traffic when a huge blast about seven cars ahead shattered my windshield and knocked me out.
I awoke what was probably twenty minutes later.
Disoriented, I open my eyes. A huge pillar of smoke is reaching the top of the trees that border the highway. This is when I feel a severe pain in my arm. I look at it and notice a bend in my forearm, it's badly broken. My car has slid back a good fifteen feet and is now crooked. About a minute later my hearing is starting to return but is still muffled. The first sounds I heard was screaming. It looks like other cars around me got it much worse. There was a larger car in front of me that may have shielded some of the blast.
I step out of my car and look towards the billowing smoke. There are about five men equipped with what looks like automatic rifles standing near the origin of the flames. I can't see anything else besides this.
""Are they military?"" I thought.
When I got back in my car I started it up again without any problems. I guess this will be the only good thing to happen today.
I begin to drive through the wreckage of other cars carefully. All their windows were blown out as well. Peering into some vehicles I didn't see a lot of motion. I was telling myself they were all just knocked out like I was, but I knew otherwise. When I got closer to where the blast originated I saw a charred car. The men holding the rifles saw me driving and ordered me to stop. There's a lot of firepower there so I wasn't taking any chances.
They asked me with what sounded like a Russian accent, ""How much gas you have in tank?""
""I'm at a quarter of a tank full."" I reply. I never really get too much in there because of prices now and the shortage. Did they want to leave the scene?
I glanced to my right and saw one of the other guys with them pull out a hose from a backpack and open another cars' gas door. He began syphoning their gas into a tank of their own. He was going car to car doing this.
I was snapped back to attention when I heard, ""Give us what we want and no problems, okay?""
""Okay"" naturally comes out when you have a gun in your face and asked a question like this.
One of the others walked up to him and whispered something to him. All I saw was a head nod in response. That's when I started hearing the unmistakable sound of gunshots. They were killing any witnesses.
In a panic I ducked down below the steering wheel and slammed the gas. I definitely hit the guy that was holding me hostage as well as pin-balling off of some cars along the way. I heard my car getting hit by their fire.
I got off the next exit and started heading back home. How I made it out of there I'll never know.
Now is not the time for thinking, now is the time for preparation. This has only just begun.",0
"The station was near empty this time of night. The cold grey fog had swept into the corridors turning the lights into hazy yellow clouds. It was perfect, after weeks of scouting the stations on the J line I had found a time when the trains still ran, but had minimal people. As I come up to the end of the platform I glance down. The distance to the rail seemed much higher than I had remembered. Not that it would matter soon. I check the sign. 10 minutes.
The wait is agony. I pace back and forth scuffing my shoes against the yellow raised dots marking the drop into the train rails. The recessed dark metal and stone that would likely be very close, very soon. Maybe if I were blind I could have just pretended I didn't notice these and-
Tak. Tak.
Someones here? I turn. A pale woman with pitch black hair and heels emerges from the fog. Her chiffon mermaid dress bounces as each stiletto marches closer towards me. The scarlet of her lips stand out against her lovely skin. The look on her face, all-knowing and poised. I've never seen a more beautiful woman in my life.
We stand face to face, and I can't help but stare into her eyes. She's not saying anything, nothing at all, but it's as if we had been speaking the entire time. The feeling of familiarity and safety draws me closer and closer. I stare and stare, my eyes drawn to every portion of her frame. She stares back with confusion at first, then understanding. After what felt like an eternity she brings her hand to her face, and coyly drags a finger against those scarlet lips. I swallow.
A low rumble starts in the distance followed by a whistle. Its the train. I came all this way, all this time but I just couldn't turn away.
""You're...Beautiful.""
The woman smiles, and walks towards me, crowding the space around me. My heart races, and I make no move to stop her, close enough that I can feel the cold off of her skin. She makes a spinning motion with her hands. Must mean...
Icy hands brush up my back. The feeling of her fingers and palms tracing up my back makes me shudder. The train approaches swiftly, growing larger and closer by the second. For a moment I think she's holding onto me. Clinging onto my torso.
""I have never met someone who looked at me the way you do. You've made an old woman very happy."" She whispers into my ear.
""Who are you?"" I ask placing a hand on her wrist.
""The one you've been waiting for.""
Before I can respond she withdraws her embrace and suddenly her hands are against my back. With a gentle nudge, I'm pushed off the edge.

"""Jerry...Jerry!""
Jerry jerked his head up, looking left then right at the millions of angels staring back at him. The podium was empty! Coming to his senses, he felt the soft hum of a trillion tappings of tiny, bored fingertips that reverberated across the Infinity Boardroom to the end of the universe and back.
""Jerry,"" God sighed patiently, ""Please. If you may. It is your turn.""
""Y-yes,"" he stammered, echoing his uncertainty across The Loudspeaker. Now biting his tongue, he galloped up to the podium, still mid-blush. Placing his palm on The Dial, screens appeared down as far as the eye can Holy See.
Clearing his throat, finally, he began:
""Your Majesty. Winged souls. Betty..."" — he could just make out Betty mouthing 'Oh, stop it!' in the distance — ""My team and I have read through His Holy Source code...with His Divine Permission"" — God nodded in approval here — ""and it appears we had overlooked some of our Loop functions."" Knowing nods across the Universe sent ripples through the ether, followed by a quite beautiful and harmonious 'Ohhhhh' beginning to sound. ""Humans can in theory Loop in as many souls as they wish. Which is exactly what they are doing. Which is why a good number of you are here...""
Jerry rotated his hand on The Dial. ""If you take a look at the screeeennns...."" — he over-emphasized the last word — ""you'll see our Soul quota for this era, which has been absolutely eclipsed by Humans' ingenuity recently. For the older souls here, the red line on the bottom indicates how many Souls we should be producing...quite flat, mostly...and the really fat blue line on top is how many are actually being produced. You see that up-tick near the end?
""I am afraid that with their near-daily and quite honestly, exponential, advances in Artificial Intelligence, engineering, physics...we are spelling the end of the Universe as we know it. It's only a matter of time before **they** tap into the Source code itself...
""So my team and I are going to turn off Time Production – yes, literally stop Time – until we figure this out. Our soul output will stall for a few Biblical Days...It's the best we can do.""
God clenched His Dial, projecting an empty image with a floating beard onto the Infinity Boardroom's many screens. ""Hold on one moment, Jerry. I'd like to get Satan's input on this. This relates to his department.""
There was a long silence that felt like an eternity. Sure enough, an eternity later, Satan's face was occupying the top right corner of the screens.
""Hey!"" Satan said.
""Hey,"" God said. ""Jerry is just with me right now. Jerry?""
""Yeah, I'm here. Satan, do you hear me?""
""Perfectly,"" Satan said.
""Great,"" Jerry continued, ""As I was saying, we can't have one soul going to Hell with another to Heaven. It's defeating the whole purpose of our merit-based system.""
""Or demerit-based system,"" Satan hissed. ""As it were.""
God interjected: ""Satan, do you have enough souls to operate the machinery Down There for a few Biblical Days? We need to have a look at the Source code, so we'll have to stop Time herself, but we don't want to muck you up.""
""How many Biblical Days are we talking about?"" Satan asked.
""About five.""
After another eternity, Satan gasped: ""Five?""
""Yeah. Five.""

"The brain considered the liver for a few moments longer.
""You are utterly replaceable."" Said the brain with conviction.
Everyone else let out a collective gasp.
""This will be the fourth time, this month, that the liver has let us all down. Just look at stomach right now!""
Stomach was black and blue from a night of heaving and contracting. Liver had sat idly by and watched as Stomach suffered.
""N-now you l-listen here Brain, there's only s-soooo much I can d-do!"" faltered Liver stupidly.
A moment of silence passed before stomach rumbled violently.
""That does it, I'm done with you Liver."" Decreed the brain. ""You might enjoy it, but the rest of us suffer too!""
""Brain, a private word?"" Asked Heart calmly.
""Very well.""
Heart watched Brain for a few beats before speaking.
""I've always been your closest friend and trusted advisor, right Brain?""
""That you have, Heart, that you have."" Brain beamed proudly at Heart.
""Then let me say, we can't just throw out one of our own. We are him and him, us.""
""Might I remind you of Appendix?!"" Brain exclaimed wildly.
""A different matter entirely, we as a council decided Appendix must leave for the safety of us all."" Heart reasoned wisely.
Brain groaned and ached. ""All of this is making me tired.""
""Let us rest on it for today and- Brain?"" Heart stopped suddenly.
""GOOD GOD! OH GOD YES!"" brain shouted inexplicably. ""DO YOU FEEL THAT HEART? DO YOU?!""

"its been 5 days. no, maybe 6. At this point the number of days doesn't seem to matter much. Im much more concerned about how we will get food and water. Theres only three of us; me, my Co worker Tommy, and a random named Jason. Our best guess is that an all out war broke out and there probably aren't many people left in the city that we're in, we got hit pretty hard. I could see nothing but plains, trucks, tanks, missiles, and bullets when i was on my way to grab a late dinner and head back to the office. Not only was there an overwhelming amounts of military presence, but there were some strange aircrafts that I, nor Tommy could identify. We took refuge in the basement of the office, i guess working late finally paid off because my apartment building was completely demolished from what i could see. We saw a man running for his life jus before we headed for the basement so we let him in, introduces himself as Jason, and that was that.
Day 7: So far we've been pretty understanding as to why Jason has seemed a little...off. I mean, the man says he has a family that he has no idea if they are okay, nor would i guess that they are. The entire world as we know it could be crumbling and or completely gone by now; we're all a little stressed to say the least. But Jason seems to have a certain trait about him that we can't put our finger on. His slouched posture, very long arms, and almost always bent knees give him an eerie appearance. His words are slurred and jumbled to the point that you would think he's either wasted or just learned the language...we're going to be keeping an eye on him.
Day 8: We broke into a locked supply closet on the 4th floor and found a couple cases of water and granola bars mixed in with office supplies, so we've bought ourselves a little bit more time. Once again, Jason has given me more reasons to be suspicious of his motives. We all decided to check each floor for supplies since our situation was getting dire and we needed food and water. I took the 2nd, Tommy took the 3rd, and Jason was given the 4th. After searching to no avail me and Tommy met back up on the main floor and doubled over each of our floors to make sure we didn't miss anything. Jason then met us soon after on the 2nd floor and said he didn't find anything either. ""okay"" i replied, ""we're double checking each of the floors just to make sure we didn't miss anything. help us clear this one and the 3rd then we'll go up to the 4th and check that one again as well."" Jason then seemed very reluctant to the idea and even accused me of not trusting him. That's okay, were all hungry and on edge. I calm but firmly tell him that our only motives are to find some supplies to help us last a little while longer until we can find some better placement other than this (office that i love being in so much.) So, as a team, we make it to the 4th floor and conduct our search. not 10 minutes in we come across a locked door that almost looked like someone was trying to hide it. strange, i thought. how could Jason miss this door that was pretty much right infant of your face when you walk up the stairs. i shrugged it off and said ""lets bust it open. Theres bound to be something useful in there."" Tommy, mirroring my confusion of Jason, was down. Grabbed a chair and made his way to the door to help me bust it down. Its been a few hours since and Jason's only take a couple sips of water and hasn't touched the granola bar. Im not sure how he's still standing considering how long we've gone without food or water. More for us i guess...
Day 10: Tommy's gone. I finally found the ease of mind to take a nap for a little while and upon waking up i see Jason in his corner and Tommy's nowhere to be found. ""uh..where's Tom?"" i ask Jason, ""Oh I'm not sure. he said he wanted to go check out the 4th floor again for more supplies. He should be back soon."" he said in a very calm tone. That's reasonable, i thought. ""Ill go join him, I'm pretty curious as well."" ""NO"" pleads Jason,"" what?"" i replied, ""i mean, uh, I tried to go with him too. He said we should stay down here. He wanted to be alone for a little while."" ""...alright. i guess ill stay here then."" That just doesn't seem like Tom to me. My watch broke when breaking into that closet but I've got to imagine Its been close to 4 hours since I've woken up and he's still not back. Im going up there to look for him if he's not back soon. With or without Jason.
Night of Day 10: Oh god i hope he's not wondering where I'm at yet. Jason was beginning to nod off so i slipped out of the basement and made my way upstairs to look for Tommy. I didn't have to go more than one flight of stairs before i saw a trail of blood along the walls and hand railing. That, and half of his shirt, are the only things I've found of Tommy so far. I was wondering why the hell Jason had only his undershirt on when i woke up. What the fuck did he do to him? Honestly thats not something i really want to know right now. All i know is i need to get the hell out of here befor

"I hated doing this, ibutI had to. It was always the same. The peeling wallpaper in the train compartment, The uncomfortable seats, the boring English countryside, father's breath ticking away the time. I had to sit perfectly still or father would start to get angry, and he did terrible things while calm, he was horrible when he was angry.
""You must be calm. This is a dance we are doing. We must be perfect or it will all go terribly. I would be most upset if things went poorly."" My father spoke with a perfect cadence, every word a measured thing.
""I know this, Father. I hate that you do it this way. That you must make me do these things. It's terrible."" I mumbled softly while watching the clock. It was three fifty-seven am. The plan was to go into effect at four.
""We have spoken on this. You will continue to do as instructed. I will hear no more of this."" Father explained, his voice hard and cruel.
The next three minutes were horrible. We sat there in perfect silence, both of us watching the clock. Once it stroke seven I stood and opened the train door. I waved down one of the workers, She waved back and started walking my way. The plan had to start exactly at four, four hours after the train set off from London. This was the time when the worker would be finishing her rounds and not be noticed for another three hours.
I stepped back into the carriage and sat down. Father smiled at me from where he hid behind the door. The stewardess peaked her head in a question on her lips. I spoke my lines, they had been practiced a thousand times before father said I got them right. ""Oh. I don't mean to bother, but the blinds on this window are tricky and the sun is blinding."" As I spoke I knew the girl's fate was sealed.
She stepped into the carriage to fix the blind. My father moved quickly, as he plunged a knife into the girl's neck. She did not have time to scream before crumpling to the floor. ""You see boy. Nobody can take this from us. This was a perfect plan. Nobody will know what happened to her. All the waiting was worth it."" He always loved his speeches after a kill.
I moved just as quickly as he did when I buried my own knife into his spine. ""You always plan to much old man. I had to wait months for this kill. Why spend months planning on ten seconds of bliss. I'm done with you father."" I hissed in his ear as his body collapsed onto hers. Father's plan was perfect. Exactly at this moment, the train was moving over a bridge, so nobody noticed the bodies being pushed out of the window to plummet into the icy waters below.
I laid down for the best sleep I had had in years.",0
"Growing up in the city with two brothers, I valued being alone from a very young age. I often used to (and sometimes still do) dream of being the only child. Not because I wouldn't have to share or because Mom would spoil me a little more. I just wanted to be alone. I think that's why the week with Grandpa each summer meant so much to me. It wasn't that I didn't or don't love my family, it's that I wanted to know what it was to be me.
Grandpa understood being alone. I hadn't known my Grandma. Well at least I didn't remember. There some pictures of her and I – me in a diaper and her holding a cocktail - but they could have been any other baby and I wouldn't have know any better. Grandpa never talked about her and I'm not sure that he really missed her. By all accounts they had been very much in love, but Grandpa was a pragmatist and never seemed to dwell on things.
Mostly during that week each summer, Grandpa would leave me alone. I'd explore the channel behind his house or dig through the barn looking for forgotten treasure. When I was a little older, I'd read a GooseBump or spend the whole day watching TV. Grandpa didn't much care what I did.
Grandpa – like all adults in my mind – was concerned about things that were neither important nor interesting. He did a lot of rummaging. Seemed to need to go on boring shopping trips all the time. Spent a lot of time with the newspaper. I never gave any of these things any thought.
Occasionally I would have to do some chore. Painting a railing, cleaning an attic or some other project that needed to be done, but really didn't need to be done. These generally lasted less than a day and were more for the sake of him being able to tell my mom how he had whipped me in to shape more than anything else. We were in the same space, but weren't sharing the same time.
The summer I turned 14 was the first summer I remember not wanting to go to Grandpa's. I had been allowed some small freedoms at home and the allure of being alone with my Grandpa for a week evaporated quickly. I didn't need this anymore now that I finally had my own room and was allowed to stay out till 7. Plus my girlfriend who I was madly in love with was definitely going to dump me if I didn't see her for a week.
On top of all that it rained all week. I did what any 14 year old stuck in a house for a week effectively without an adult would do. Lots of tv. Lots of computer games. Lots of texting. Lots of masturbating. Grandpa didn't bother me outside of breakfast and dinner. Even then we barely spoke. He asked me about school and girls, but I gave him the same canned responses I gave to every adult. I don't think I asked him anything.
The week passed uneventfully as it always had. On Thursday, Grandpa let me know that the chore for this week would be organizing the basement while he went to whatever the VA was.
""Now when you're down there make sure to sweep and clean up as much crap as you can, but don't go lookin where you don't need to""
Like all adults Grandpa was so easy to ridicule. ""How will I know what I do or do not need?"", I replied in a voice that only 14 year old boys who think they are smarter than god can muster.
He stared at me for a couple of seconds before sternly saying, ""Don't open the box that say ‘ bones'on it.""
""Oh, Okay Grandpa."" How old did he think I was? Like he would really be storing bones in the basement.
We didn't say anything else. He finished and left. I watched some TV and texted my girlfriend about watching out for bones in the basement. Eventually I sauntered downstairs.
The basement was surprisingly empty. A little dust, but really there wasn't much to do. As I swept, I absentmindedly scanned the boxes in front of me smiling thinking about the box of bones and my Grandpa the serial killer. At some point I realized that I had stopped sweeping and found myself staring at a cardboard box. Neatly written on the side ""Bones – Stay Out.""
I braced myself. What the actual hell man? I picked up the box carefully. It didn't rattle. It didn't smell like the dead rats in the garage. It was heavy. Whatever was inside shifted slightly. The box looked and felt like a moving box. A normal cardboard box. That didn't stop me from shaking.
I slowly pulled back the lid and looked inside. No bones. I felt cheated, but relieved. Still what was this box?
Photographs. Letters. Old office papers. The letters were addressed to and signed ‘ Bones ’. I recognized some of the names who wrote the letters from a family reunion, but a lot were from someone I didn't know. Who was Penny? She seemed to like Bones. The papers and pictures were all faded, but showed men who looked like GI Joes smoking cigarettes and smiling in the Jungle.
The next day at breakfast I asked my Grandpa who Bones was. I never really looked at adults the same way again after that week. I don't think that was the moment I grew up, but as I become more boring and notice children presenting me with the same bland answers I used to give adults I can't help but think of my own box in the basement.",0
"Teddy's eyes sparkle with excitement as he rummages enthusiastically and yet somehow reverently through the dusty and scuffed red leather suitcase, the case releases the warm scent of pipe tobacco, small hands lifting stacks of somehow unfaded paper. ""Look at this one dad!"" he says, waving the old magazine, a copy of Amazing stories. The garishly illustrated cover depicting a towering, glinting robot brandishing a finned ray gun and looming menacingly over an improbably breasted swooning girl drooping in the arms of a lantern jawed Flash Gordon knockoff. ""SHOCKING vision of the future depicts humanity as SLAVES to artificial intelligence! Wow! Awesome!"" I ruffle his hair and he smiles back up at me. ""I remember reading all these as a kid myself. I didn't know dad had kept them all these years."" My eyes naturally wander to the mantle, a photograph in a simple silver frame. Me, dad and a largemouth Bass held between us. Both of us wearing identical stupid grins, I with a beer in my free hand, dad with his pipe.
I can still smell his pipe as I hear his voice across the years. ""Son, I am so damned proud of you. I know I haven't been there as much as maybe I could have been, but you've grown into a fine man."" His eyes swim behind his glasses a little. ""Come on dad, how many of those beers have you had?"" I laugh. I was young, I didn't understand. His voice cracks a little. ""I just wanted you to know son. You'll come to realise that someday it all ends and that if you haven't said what needs to be said, well, that's something that can never be undone."" He blinks and pokes his pipe into the corner of his mouth with a hand that trembles slightly. The only sound is the quiet burble of the river as we sit in companionable silence for a while, broken by the plink of the fishing float being pulled under and the ratcheting click of the reel. ""Get that net ready boy, we got a bite, and she's a big 'un! One for the album, you bet!""
That's the thing about clearing a loved ones house. So many memories, waiting to ambush you without warning. A tiny blue porcelain vase with a chip in the rim, a small brass cup engraved ""Worlds best fisherman"", a walnut handled pocket knife. Things that mean nothing to anyone else, but I know them all intimately. I watch my boy as he goes through the case, savouring the fantastical artwork of the covers and neatly piling the stacks of pulp magazines by title, so like his grandfather, so like me. I remember reading my stories, my sheets tented above my head and my Thunderbirds lantern casting its glow over the pages. Living for an hour or so as an intrepid space adventurer, or a swashbuckling pirate until finally falling asleep and dreaming a childs dreams of heroism and adventure. The scent of pipesmoke and cedar shavings entwined with warm memory.
""Say dad, do you think grandpa would have minded if I had these? They're so cool!""
""Son, ""I say, ""I think your grandpa would have wanted you to have those with his love, and mine.""
I feel my eyes welling with pride and love. Teddy just rolls his at me. ""Geez dad, don't get all mushy on me.""
He's young. He doesn't understand yet.",0
"At the beginning of the 20th Century, when the automobile was still new, gasoline engines were but one of the many technologies vying for dominance. Some early cars were electric, some ran on boilers fueled by burning coal or wood.
When Henry Ford opened his first factory in Detroit, the tri-state region of Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio was coincidentally taking off as a major player in the nascent dairy farming industry. (Michigan is still one of the top ten dairy producers) Prior to the turn of the century, family farms ruled as the modern process of Pasteurization had not yet existed.
It's a little known fact that Henry Ford kept a sizable herd of cows on a farm just outside of Dearborn for the sole purpose of capturing and using the methane produced as a source of fuel. Several Model T prototypes exist to this day with tanks designed to hold compressed methane gas.
Fortunately, the process proved to be more costly at the time than traditional gasoline. If not, we might still be driving around today in cars powered by cow farts.
& nbsp;
**EDIT**: I found some photographic proof showing a cow hooked up to a beeswax coated silk bag for methane collection as well as an early prototype of a vehicle with Henry Ford standing next to it. Note the methane tanks on the side of the vehicle near the engine: http: //i.imgur.com/3nuezWc.jpg",0

"He's such a dick sometimes. Being on-call for that guy is a 24/7 duty. One time I was on a date and he did the same thing when I was in the bathroom. I was guaranteed to score. When I came out of the bathroom, I tried to keep a smile on my face. But that's what I get. These looks didn't come cheap. The dude has an ironic aura to everything he does.
So after his distasteful drop-in, I couldnt help but give a sarcastic sigh. Effectively starting my shift until he says ""no mas,"" I could only wonder what the red man wanted this time. Would I have to scare kids by hiding under their beds? Possess some poor sucker in front of his family? Make a shmuck like me shit his pants on a date as some sort of reminder of how often it happens to me? I really had no idea.
Being a demon sounds cool on paper, and all you have to do is the occasional ""bidding,"" but at least give me a task with just a little bit of substance. Or at least let me pick my own hours. This shit is tiresome. Nobody learns about or fears you since they don't even know you exist. And the things you're asked to do aren't exactly of biblical proportions. That whole getting YOLO to become the viral shit storm it is was my idea the entire time, but no, he needed the credit.
So as I sat there, struggling to get the energy to get out of bed, I gave the ceiling one last hard glance, shook my head, and swung my legs out of bed. As I made my way to the bathroom through a giant pile of dirty clothes on the floor, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. And damn, did I look good.",0
"""A second Chrome icon? How did that get there?"" *Must have been from that whole fiasco where I had to use Firefox for six months*, I muttered. *Silly Sophos Anti-Virus, making Chrome crash at every turn. *
I noticed it was slightly different but couldn't quite place what it was. I bothered to click on it. The tabs were a little unusually shaped. *Maybe that's a theme or something, but I can't recall putting anything on it. *
I decided to see what was up with this thing. First stop: the site I read too many times that had the latest headlines from the TV news industry.
The headline at the top was a doozy: ""Sinclair Broadcast Group Declares Chapter 11 Bankruptcy"". Now, in the real world, they'd come close to doing that a few years ago, but then they took on three billion dollars in television stations and transformed themselves overnight. But no, there's the article, Sinclair was going to have to sell almost all of its stations and among the few they were keeping were Baltimore and Columbus. Baffled, I checked my normal Chrome window and found that it had normal headlines. *Oh dear. …Let's see if any other sites are doing this. *
My next stop was Uni Watch, which had a purple background. *Oh dear, Paul Lukas in the real world doesn't like purple. This is getting very crazy…* I took a look and began to put the pieces together. Today's Uni Watch lede was about the San Francisco Giants…which seemed innocuous until it mentioned that ""the Giants changed their colors from black and orange to black and sky blue, to complement the Azure Gate Bridge…""
I stopped in my tracks. I realized that the way things were going, I had one other thing to search.
I pulled up Google—or, as it was stylized in this world, ""google."" —and typed something else in.
""Super Bowl XIX.""
Sure enough, the Jets made it to a Super Bowl in this world. And the Dolphins managed to squeak into Super Bowl XXIII.
I immediately knew what I had on my hands, closed the tab and renamed the shortcut.

"""Holy shit""
Those were the first words Dr. ""Alien Expert"" said as he reviewed the the weird recordings the extraction team found in the ship we took down 18 hours ago.
It's been 21 days since they showed up. Millions of lives have been lost and our only hope rested in these weird ass recordings. Of course, I haven't seen anything yet because I don't have clearance. I'm just another soldier standing in the corner while everybody is scrambling to figure out our next move. The aliens were kicking our asses, and by ""ours"" I mean the whole damn world, not just the USA.
The attacks began in northern Montana. 8 days later Austria got hit. Then France, Germany and Holland were attacked. Spain got the worst of it all. The country doesn't even exist anymore.
We needed something. Anything.
Various military leaders from different countries were here in the same room. Anxiously awaiting what the alien expert would say next.
""Holy shit"", he repeated.
""Doctor Caellum, what do you see? "", asked Fleet Admiral Kane. ""Does it show something that can help us?""
The doctor turned towards us with tears in his eyes. He could barely speak but I caught what he said.
""This isn't their first visit""
The room went silent. Doctor Caellum composed himself and explained the situation.
These aliens had been here before and had to flee Earth because they lost the war for the planet...against fucking dinosaurs. They've been planning this invasion for millions of years.
""So..."", Secretary of Defense Oliver was flabbergasted. ""What do you propose we do? Call Japan and ask for Godzilla? We're fucked.""
Lieutenant general Takashi didn't seem amused by the Secretary of Defense remarks and just proceeded to ask the important questions.
""It took a lot of manpower to take down this ship. Can we still defend ourselves? Can humanity survive this attack? "", Takashi asked.
Doctor Caellum proceeded to explain with enthusiasm that the Aliens wrote briefings fearing the ""new species"" is not as useless as they seem. Cocky bastards.
The whole room went into a frenzy planning the next move. Everybody was trying to come up with their own plan. Wasting precious time.
I couldn't keep listening to the pointless arguing and just spoke up.
""Permission to speak freely, sir"", I shouted, not exactly knowing whose permission I was asking.
The Secretary of Defense Oliver granted me permission. ""Yes, private Lopez?""
""The briefings and recordings state that the Alien menace came here looking for a species that no longer exists. They prepared for an enemy that's no longer here. We now know how to hurt them. Let's show these fuckers that humans are not here for the bullshit"".",0

"(First response to a writing prompt ever, constructive criticism please)
Kevin arrived home and plodded to the door. Sales had been killing him from the inside for years. Tired legs carried him to the front door. he couldn't find the key, probably lost in his pockets somewhere. However he couldn't shake the feeling something felt off, it had him on edge. Perhaps it was the cold, he absently wondered. A sharp giggle, like that of a young child snapped him from his reverie.
Kevin lived alone.
Looking up through the textured glass of his front door he saw there were far too many lights on, he always made a point to make sure all the lights were off. There were three figures inside, one was much larger than the others. There was a muffled murmur of conversation as the figures prepared what looked like dinner. The smell of a hot, fresh pasta bake took him back years in a second to a childhood of wonder and happiness, now lost in the doldrums of mediocrity.
He backed away from the front door, as he fell into the drivers seat in the purple sedan he took out his ID and examined the address, the words seemed to stretch and morph, not content to lie still. The address still matched though. Perhaps he wasn't totally insane yet. Then who was inside? Robbers? Cousins up for a visit? His confidence renewed (But more confused than ever) he strode to the front door and knocked.
*Taptaptaptaptap tap tap*
There was no response from within, he tried again.
*Taptaptaptaptap tap tap*
Still nothing.
If there was to be no response from the front door, he would enter through the back. After all, it was his house. He walked around the right side of the house, past gardens that were a little overdue for some weeding and maintenance. the figures inside were inaudible now, the silence was eerie. He briefly considered the wood splitter in the shed, but decided against it. No robbers would bring their family in for tea after all.
He rounded the corner and walked up his back porch, the dining room would be visible if he continued along the porch, but the large glass sliding door was the only one on the porch. Entering his home, he looked to the right.
There was a family of three sitting for dinner. At the head of the table was a beautiful woman with auburn hair and deep blue eyes, her two children, who couldn't have been over 10 sat opposite each other. They had failed to inherit their mothers hair, instead the first had her hair pulled back in a brown ponytail. the second child had not bothered with styling, leaving a scraggly mop of brown hair atop his head.
""Hello?"" he asked, none of this was making sense
The woman turned and stared at him, mouth agape
""You can't be here"" she curtly said
""I don't think you understand ma'am, this is my house"" he replied confidently
Taking him by the arm she led him outside
""It was your house, you live somewhere else now"" she muttered
""Was?"" he recanted
""Kevin, what day is it?"" she asked tenderly
""Tuesday, How do you know my name?"" he demanded
She gazed deeply at him with the piercing blue eyes of someone who had known the greatest love the world could give. They were the eyes of someone who had that love rent and taken from them, broken to pieces and incinerated in hellfire. Tears dripped down her cheeks, she embraced him and whispered the most painful words he had heard in his life
Shocked, he stared down at the band on his wrist.
""It was an accident, an 18 year old behind the wheel with a BAC of 0.15. He survived, but you had some major trauma to the cranium. The doctors did their best, but it was very severe. I'm sorry"" she croaked, it was all she could do.

Year one, and they're already trying to repeal the law. Too many innocent little housewives with rape fantasies in the voting public.
Thank God it only applies to persons over 18. What a horror *that* would have been.
There's a lot of sickos in this world.
Yeah, they're trying to repeal it, but for now the law is the law, and I have to participate. I've tried so long to hold it off - to fight it. But I follow the rules. I do what I must.
My friends and family are gathering in the living room. I try to be extra nice to them. Most people don't have friends anymore, after Fetish Day - one way or the other.
Kyle, my brother, is my closest friend. He's the only one who knows my fantasy, my little fetish. He has tears in his eyes. ""Please,"" he says. ""Please don't do this.""
""It's the law, little brother,"" I tell him. And he nods and walks sadly over to the corner nearest the door. If he tries to run, I'll have to catch him. I don't want my baby brother to live out his life in prison or on the run from the law.
""Heya, Mike!"" When Bill walks in, it feels like the room done shrunk to about half its size. I've always had a strange fascination with Bill. For his fetish day, he just watched everyone else, running around in a purple tutu.
""Don't knock it till you try it,"" they say. The motto for Fetish Day.
My friends are gathered now - only the men. For my fetish I asked the womenfolk not to come. They aren't what I want. What I need.
Now that the time is approaching, I'm nervous. My hands are trembling. I can feel the excitement building though. The anticipation.
I command them, as is my right under the law, to strip down to nothing but their watches and their socks. I like socks. They cover feet, and feet are ugly things.
The human body, though, is beautiful. They stand before me, bodies and souls bared. Mike looks intrigued, and Kyle is in tears. I try to ignore Kyle. I am so turned on right now.
Bill can't seem to take his eyes off the evidence of this.
He looks kind of pissed, really. Well, it can't be helped. The law is the law.
I lead my boys over to a group of chairs in the center of the room, and start handcuffing them to the rails. One by one. Slowly. This is my one chance, and I want it to last.
My breath comes in short, shallow gasps. It's almost too much to bear. At least my hands aren't trembling any more. They know what I want to do.
I turn out the lights. There's just enough seeping in through the curtains for me to see the men in front of me. Dark enough for their eyes to shine.
I check their bonds again, making sure everyone is secure, making sure no one can move. I check Kyle's more carefully than the others.
With everyone secure, I begin to remove my clothes, one piece at a time. I stand before them in all my flabby glory, letting them drink in the sight, and wonder.
And then I pick up the knife.",0
"Johnny's knife sang as its blade pierced the rapist's gut. Blood spurted onto Johnny's cerulean mohawk and pierced face as Katherine, her shirt in tatters, watched on.
Above the three mortals, invisible to all of them, were three beasts. The first was a blood-red hellhound. fire burned in its six eyes and it lashed its twin tails as rows of serrated teeth tore furiously into the rapist's guardian. Floating above the Rapist was a black Ram; its coiled horns twisting gruesomely into the hellhound's fiery skin. Its hooves kicked and writhed as the dog's flaming claw slashed open the demon's belly and eviscerated its entrails. Standing next to and consoling katherine was a lamb. Ascalon's Three eyes peered worriedly at her charge as she whispered prayers.
Johnny's knife stabbed its last as the hound tore the Ram's head off. With a heavy sigh, both possessed and demon fell back into the underworld. Johnny dropped the knife and stumbled back into the alley wall, his legs buckling beneath him as he trembled under the weight of his justice. Katherine crawled over, leaning against the wall next to her good samaritan.
When the two caught their breath they talked. Thanks, forgiveness, tears, names, life, even God was mentioned. Ascalon eyed the Hellhound suspiciously. It was licking its wounds above Johnny when three of its eyes drifted down to the lamb. All six widened in shock.
""Ascalon?""
Demon voices don't change. Their appearance does; It fluctuates with their power and sin, but an angel's voice never wavers. So it was that after 600 aeons Ascalon recognized her old friend.
""U...Uriel?""
""It's been a long time.""
Ascalon's third eye slammed shut as her remaining two glowed with rage.
""I never thought I'd see you again."" Uriel continued.
""Don't talk to me, Blasphemer! You betrayed HIM! You betrayed me!""
""Ascalon you know why I did it. I explained it to you but you were so deep in that tyrant's pocket you wouldn't listen.""
""You dare to call HIM a tyrant? You, who worship The morning star?!""
""He's lied to you, Ascalon. Or at least he would, if he didn't rewrite the truth every time he needed to. Hell is nothing like that. I joined Lucifer for my own reasons. How conceited Jehovah is! To actually think that separation from him was a punishment! What do you think we were fighting for?
""DON'T YOU DARE TAKE HIS NAME IN VAIN!""
""Ascalon, calm down. I understand that you're-
""You understand?! How could you possibly?! You betrayed me. I saw Michael himself cut you down at the battle of Jupiter!""
""Ascalon that-""
""You're despicable. how could you be so selfish? I thought I knew you. I thought-""
""DO YOU THINK I ENJOYED IT?""
""...What?""
""I saw you too. Do you think I took pleasure in your anguish? Did you think I reveled in throwing aeons of joy away?""
""Of course! Only a demon-""
""I may be a demon, Ascalon, but I never stopped being Uriel. I don't know how you deal with it. How can you call it free will if he makes all the choices for you?""
""Freedom is the liberty to do what you were meant to.""
""I envy you, Ascalon. I'm glad that you can live with a given meaning, but that's just not enough for me. It never was.""
""How can't it be? HE's infinite! You could come back with me. Please, HE'll forgive you. HE'll solve your problems with a snap of the fingers. Things can be like they were...""
""Isn't the demon supposed to tempt you? I appreciate it. I love you, And I almost love him, but his existence is simply too constricting on mine.""
""...I'm sorry.""
""I'm sorry too.""
The flames consuming the lamb and the hound died, as the two looked at their charges. Katherine and Johnny were calmer now. Sirens wailed in the distance as the two spoke of life.
""Mass every Sunday, volunteers, cares for others..."" Uriel said, ""She's a fine Christian woman.""
""Yes."" Ascalon responded. ""I'm very proud of her.""
""Johnny ain't that bad either. He's a rebel, and he can be a little shit sometimes, but he knows what he believes in.""
""He killed a man at 17. He'll carry that for the rest of his life.""
""I know. But don't underestimate the strength of sinners. They carry burdens the saints couldn't dream of.""
""The best saints were the worst sinners, you know.""
""Yeah, but then they got help from the man upstairs. Sinners like me and Johnny have to carry it alone.""
""Why?""
""Because it's the only way we know how.""
Police arrived. Katherine was given a blanket and hot cocoa, while Johnny was slammed into the hood of the cruiser and cuffed. Katherine threw the cup away and started beating on the officer.
""Oh no, KATHERINE! STOP!""
""You know Ascalon, maybe you should let her.""
""But she's sinning!""
""For another person? Did you ever think that maybe Grace is a more meaningful sacrifice than a life?""
""Don't be ridiculous.""
""Hey, I'm just saying. Maybe if Jesus had given his perfection instead of his life, he could understand these humans.""
""HE understands them more than you or I ever could.""
""But can he do it without cheating?""
Ascalon was silent.
""Hey Ascalon?""
""Yeah?""
""I know we disagree about Jehovah's methods, but I still consider you my friend.""
""Hate the sin, love the sinner.""
""In Hell we say, 'Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,' but same thing really.""
the lamb laid down with the lion as Katherine was pushed, smiling, into the police cruiser with Johnny. Uriel sat down next to his friend, both tails wagging. Ascalon's third eye opened.
""I love you, Uriel.""
""I love you too, Ascalon.""
""We should probably follow them. They'll need our guidance.""
""I've got dibs on her left shoulder. You can sit on the right.""
All three of Ascalon's eyes rolled, just like they had 600 aeons ago.",0
"They all laugh.
They have always laughed, at least ever since my power was discovered. All the boys that could fly and have super strength, the ones with flexibility, telekinesis, and even invisibility. They all thought mine was pointless, and that I didn't deserve any power. I was still obsessed with researching superheroes and villains, dreaming of what I could've been.
Who knew the one boy that wanted more than anyone else to save the day, to be the hero, would get the power to expand pasta. Yes, you're probably laughing at it now. As my school days went by, then my college years, and throughout most of my adulthood I watched as all my peers were the heroes. The ones that stopped the bad guys, like I always dreamed of. They laughed.
At least, until May 25th, 2468. I was working early in the morning at my average job, drinking my average coffee, thinking about my average life. I had to work there, I wasn't a hero like all the others, I was a person. Nobody else was at the office, it was still dark outside.
Suddenly, a tremendously large man burst through the office door, heaving as he brushed the splintered pieces of wood off of himself. I cowered, crouching under my desk, because I knew who that was. He was Hybrelly, one of the most wanted supervillain terrorists in the world. He was known for targeting civilians and public places, devouring all the food he could find, and next devouring the people. I had some time to get positioned quietly under my desk, and I moved my chair to hide me. I remembered from my research that he would first find the food, so I assumed he was in the break room, eating from our fridge. My lunch was the only one in there.
Hybrelly moved around the office, looking for workers. It was only a matter of time before he found me. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in my head, and I knew what had to be done. I stood up from my hiding spot. When Hybrelly turned to face me, with that sickening grin on his face, I looked him dead in the eyes.
""Don't *ever* eat my leftover spaghetti.""
His stomach started expanding, and the look of fear in his eyes told me to keep going. It was getting bigger and bigger, until Hybrelly exploded in a burst of blood and guts as I shielded my eyes.
They all laughed. But not on May 25th. On May 25th, *I* was the hero.",0
"""H-hello?"" mewls a small voice at my elbow, accompanied by a tug on the leather strap of my handbag. It's a tiny girl, six years old if she's a day, all bushy blonde pigtails straining to burst free of the red hairties.
""I'm *lotht*,"" she confesses in the charming lisp that signifies missing teeth - and I immediately go into that mothering mode that's instinctive to women in my family, acquired from my deceased mother; bending down to the child's height, concern writ large on my face.
""Oh darling, how did you get lost? Do you know where your parents are?""
She screws up her pink face in concentration, then shakes her head, the jaunty pigtails swishing about,
""Nup,"" she confesses, poking a toe at the gap under my heels, then, ""funny shoeth,"" she lisps, delighted.
I look her over for clues about her identity or parentage. She's wearing a yellow t-shirt with a frog on it, no shoes and orange shorts that are probably a size too big for her - one hand keeps hitching them up. She doesn't have a backpack or anything else that might give a clue to her identity.
""What's your name, little one?""
She thinks for a moment, then points to my hair, ""I want hair like *that*.""
Attention span of a gnat, apparently. I take her tiny hand in mine and say, ""Do you want to come for a walk and help me find the mall security guard?""
The blond head nods assent and she plunges her grubby hand into mine, twisting a corner of her froggy t-shirt in the other thumb.
We walk for a while past the shops and she seems content enough, skipping slightly and grinning at me; a smile that's half gums and half baby teeth. Her eyes are so brown that they're nearly black, I notice.
""Um,"" she says, tugging my hand, ""Can we go thith way?""
Her look is pleading; the awkward smile of a child out of her depth, but trying hard. She's pulling me gently towards a dead part of the mall; semi-closed down, only a couple of shop lights are on.
""Honey, I don't think that's a great idea, we need to -""
""*Pweaaaaaaathe, *"" she begs, pulling my hand with both of hers now.
Oh what the hell. There was bound to be security down there anyway.
As we walk I notice scribbles on her hands and arms, amongst the natural grime of a six year old.
""What's that on your arms little one?""
""Nameth,"" she lisps laconically.
""Whose names?""
""Um,"" she pauses to look into a derelict shop, ""nameth of peopleth I have to meet today.""
How curious.
""Look,"" she says, pointing to her palm.
On the tiny pink pad of her thumb is scrawled a name - my name.
""Um,"" she looks at her toes and wiggles them, ""We have to go into the shop now.""
""What?""
The dark void of the shop frontage yawns in front of me and the girl drags me in. I can't resists and I don't know why.
""Don't worry,"" she whispers, ""my mum and dad are in here - and tho are yourth.""
Hand in hand, I walk into the abyss with Death, who grins her gummy smile and skips along, all pigtails and childlike awkwardness.",0
"Akron returned to his room, another day gone and he was no closer to finding work. He was a good swordsman, but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one. He might have found work as a Night Patrolman had his unit been in one of the companies nearer home when the war was over. As it was, he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment. He was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his 'soldier's honor' stretch.
He had nearly gone to bed when there was a knock at his door. He opened it to find an empty walkway. He stepped out to look down into the tavern and saw no one rushing for the door. When he turned back to his room he saw a note just on the other side of his door. It read, ""Akron, Meet at King's Fountain. I have work. - Pitch."" Akron folded the note. Pitch had never been a brave man in the company, but he was the most resourceful. What he lacked in holding the line he more than made up for in his scrounging after the line no longer needed to be held, most of which he kept for himself.
---
Akron waited at King's Fountain as the letter asked. A chill swept through the empty square and he wished he had brought his coat. The hairs on his neck pricked when he heard a set of footsteps approaching. ""Akron old boy,"" a voice called, ""I didn't think you'd come."" He held his arms out wide.
Akron turned, ""You were right to think so,"" he replied, keeping his hands in his pockets.
""C'mon sarge,"" Pitch goaded, ""Is that any way to greet an old man-at-arms.""
""As I recall, your arm stayed sheathed more often than not,"" Akron said back, a hint of bitterness coloring his words. If Pitch was disappointed he did not show it. ""You said you had work,"" he laid down his cards. They were not and had never been friends, but the promise of work bought Pitch a meeting.
""Alright,"" Pitch said, slumping a little, ""I work with one of the Mage Schools.""
Akron waved his hand, ""No,"" he said, ""No thank you, I'll have none of that.""
Pitch raised his palms, ""Please, Sarge, just hear me out."" Akron shook his head, but then nodded. ""They just need some muscle, Sarge. You don't got to do anything, you don't got to say anything. You just need to be in the room to make my guys look tougher than they are.""
""Tougher?"" Akron spat, remembering the power the wizards wielded during the war. Some nights he could still see the crawling embers on his men when the enemy Fire Schools unleashed their power on his lines. ""Why would they need to look any more dangerous than they are?""
""Sarge, it's just a power play. This school's not a big one, they just need to bring up their numbers a bit at the meeting,"" Pitch said, shrugging his shoulders.
""What meeting?"" Akron asked, squinting at the scoundrel.
Pitch shook his head, ""I shouldn't even be telling you this,"" he said as his eyes widened.
""Talk.""
""They want a seat at the Mage's Circle,"" he said, ""Something big is about to happen in the city, and they want a part of it when it all goes down. No one's taking them seriously because they don't got the numbers.""
""So what?"" Akron asked, ""You add to them one guy who can't use magic?""
""Not just one, Sarge,"" Pitch said already starting to wince, ""I got some of the other guys from the company.""
""Gods on high, Pitch,"" Akron sighed, ""All of them?""
""No, Sarge, not all of them. Some of the boys didn't want no part of this. Still shaky from the Mage Fire. You remember don't ya Sarge?""
Akron nodded and clenched his jaw.
""I'll pay you standard plus what I would have paid the other guys,"" Pitch said, ""It won't work without you, Sarge. You gotta get them back in line, whip them up, look impressive. The mages I work with will take care of the rest.""
Akron began to shake his head, but his stomach grumbled loud. A hint of a smile crept across Pitch's mouth. ""How much does it pay?"" Akron asked.
Pitch tossed a bag of gold coins to his old superior. ""That's just what the other guys get,"" he said already grinning, ""You get that bag and four more like it.""
Akron looked inside and saw more gold than he'd seen in a long time. ""Fine,"" he said.
Pitch clapped his hands, ""Good man, Sarge.""
""But I won't take more than the men,"" Akron said, ""divi it all up evenly.""
""Alright, Sarge, alright. If that's what you want,"" Pitch said as he wrung his hands. ""The Archmage is gonna love you.""",0
"He was rather well-preserved, his body protected from the harsh Martian climate in a strange-looking spacesuit. Alone, he sat, against the wall of the cave, covered in thick sheets of dust though the cave's interior was remarkably still.
The nervous Martian colonists funneled in. Jan, recognized by the group as their ""leader"" in the closest capacity Mars could be said to have one, led the small party into the cave with cautious, controlled pace. Diagrams and charts littered the floor, also coated in heavy, red dust. Boxes and consoles with faded screens and panels watched the cave's intruders in silence. The silence was palpable; the tension, unbearable.
""Someone get Ground on the line,"" Jan ordered, and one colonist quickly shuffled out of the cave to comply.
""Will ya look at this,"" one started. Jan turned around and saw a colonist had begun rifling through the papers and charts across the floor. The one he was holding looked to be a picture of Earth. Eons of aging had faded the sheet considerably, and yet, somehow, it was recognizable. The blue marble, riddled with swirls of green...a home they'd never return to.
""Here's a diagram of human anatomy,"" another added, and Jan saw this one had indeed found an illustration of the human body.
""And look at this!"" Shouted a third, gesturing to something that appeared to be a message scrawled into the wall. Four words, written in an alien text.
""Quick, somebody, go run a scan on the papers found here, and have that imported to data management. Maybe we can crack this code,"" Jan ordered, and the group set in motion.
Jan walked over and regarded the corpse once more. *A lifetime stuck on this planet, but at least we've got company now, * she thought. With a heavy sigh, a tear dropped to the front of her helmet. *Neither of us are leaving this rock, * she added, and began to mull over it all. She'd die on the big, red rock, like this man had millions of years before her.
But none of the colonists knew that the deceased landed on Mars with a mission much braver than their own. A mission of solitude, an ensured lonely death. Millions of years prior, as the scientist in the cave breathed his final breaths, he looked over the machine's readings again and again, content to see that finally the seeds of humanity were growing in a planet besides their doomed homeworld. He approached the wall, and scrawled *Humanity on Earth: Growing, * before collapsing to the floor from the sickness that had consumed their planet. 200,000 seeding attempts, and finally a success. Their species would be saved.
The scientist died with a contented sigh, much like the one Jan breathed over his body in a time far, far away. Jan knew this discovery was *huge. * And yet, she had no idea how truly right she was.",0
"Carey had grown from small to tall in view of the woods behind her nana's trailer. Ma was usually working, or drinking, or yelling at daddy, and nana herself had died some years back (but it was still, and would always be, nana's trailer, said Ma), and so Carey would gather sticks and throw rocks and apply as much imagination as a child of average intelligence could muster to the trailer's brown, scrubby yard. Carey was a brown, scrubby child, so she felt at home in the yard, and in the other yards in the park, shuttling between them with the other children like a ragtag flock of confused, dirty geese. Sometimes one of the older children would gather the little ones around and reveal from within a crumpled paper bag a large glass bottle filled with yellow liquid, and would call it beer, and try to make the others have a taste. Carey, who had what her nana had once called owl eyes, had seen what the drink called beer had done to daddy, and to ma, and had also seen the older children crowded around the bottle, one of the boys with his pants around his knees, so she refused a sip and took her beating from the others with both fists raised. The children got into scuffs weekly, daily during the oppressive summer months, over smuggled beer, or cat taunting, or just plain boredom. These were children at whom teachers tutted, from whom nicer children from town backed away, on whom lice and sores could regularly be found.
None of the trailer park children ventured into the woods behind nana's trailer.
The woods were known by all, in that park and the one down the road and likely by the parks on the other side of the leafy expanse, to be off limits. No ballsy youth nor drunken divorcee nor curious child was foolhardy, inebriated or unloved enough to venture into the dark thicket of tangled brambles and branches. Once, Carey had asked Ma why they didn't go through the woods to visit Aunt Jan, nana's sister's daughter, who had a clean trailer and hugged Carey when they saw each other at Christmas. Ma had shook her head, the way she did at fancy envelopes from the state and at daddy when he said he had a lead on a job. ""Don't nobody go into those woods who wants a chance at coming out the other side."" She paused, and Carey thought that was it, but after a minute, she continued. ""There's all kinda dark things in these woods, Carey-bear. You stay away now, you hear?"" Carey didn't know tree names, didn't, in fact, know that trees had names, but she knew the smell of rotten sap that spewed from the black cottonwoods, and she saw the sick that spread across the leaves in summer and that mottled the bark in winter. The woods did not grow, not anymore. They stood, a silent warning, and only those who lived in the trailer parks dared sleep near its shadow.
Carey, with her owl eyes and tall limbs, with a dead nana and few friends, was not much different from the other children in the park, but being different is not always a precursor to walking a different path in this world. In Carey's case, her path shifted on a Tuesday night, which was Ma's late night at the 7/11 and daddy's night to make dinner. Most nights he heated up some pizza rolls in the microwave and let Carey watch him play Xbox, but that Tuesday he had gotten nothing but duds on his lotto tickets and couldn't be bothered with anything other than his crumpled paper bag and large glass bottle full of yellow liquid. Carey, who eventually got hungry enough to want to do something about it, was in the process of microwaving the pizza rolls herself when Ma walked in, took one look at daddy and at Carey, who had just climbed up on a stool in order to reach the microwave, and started hollering.
""Jesus fuck, Daniel, can you even remember to feed your own daughter?""
""It's not that late,"" replied daddy, not moving from his chair.
Ma's nostrils were white with anger. ""It is nearly midnight, you piece of shit.""
Carey turned away and put her rolls in the microwave, tuning out the yelling by watching the green numbers tick slowly downward. When nana was alive, Ma and daddy had to take their yelling outside or cut that shit out, but when Carey tried to suggest that they do so after nana died, daddy had hit her upside the head and told her not to use bad language. Nana had been better about keeping the peace, said Ma, but Carey wasn't sure what that meant; all she knew is when Ma and daddy got to yelling, she ate dinner in her room and kept the door shut.
After the microwave beeped, Carey took the rolls out and headed back towards her room, ignoring the fuss, but was stopped when daddy grabbed her shoulder.
""Isn't that right, honey? You'd prefer to come live with daddy?""
""Don't get her in the middle of this!"" Ma yelled, snatching Carey's other arm. The pizza rolls went flying. Carey, whose stomach felt cavernous, felt her eyes fill up with tears, although she wasn't exactly sure why they were doing that. Confused, she pulled away from both parents and dashed out the door, her heart beating rapidly in her chest. She ran next door to the Viegel's trailer, but only Old Man Viegel was awake, drinking from his own glass bottle on the porch.
""I need supper,"" said Carey, her face wet with tears. She could still hear Ma and daddy yelling. Old Man Viegel looked at her ponderously and was about to take a swig of his drink when three thunderous cracks sounded from nana's trailer. He paused, then set the bottle down on the porch.
""Better go find your own, then."" Old Man Viegel coughed, turned his head, spit out a chunk of black goo, and turned back to Carey, grinning a jack-o-lantern grin. He dug into a leather pouch on his belt and came up with a shiny rectangle. ""You'll need this.""
Carey took the proffered item. It was a silver Swiss Army knife. Daddy had one just like it. No one had left their trailers at the sound of gunshot; not even a light had turned on. Carey knew that the other families would feed her for a day and then call the state. She had seen them come, in smooth cars with their smooth talk and dirty looks at the dirty children and dirty trailers.
""Thanks,"" she said, and turned and ran off the porch and into the woods at a full sprint.
The rotten sap scent enveloped her as soon as she got past the first layer of underbrush. She could feel the small cuts being made into her arms and legs as she ran. She knew that if she ran far enough in one direction, she'd come out the other side. Daddy had taken her hunting a few times, and she knew how to tell a straight line using the sun and even the moon, but the darkness of the woods admitted no light. She kept her steps in line, focusing on a straight path, an imaginary arrow leading her straight to aunt Jan's house. She could see it in her mind: a thick red line, shining in the dark, pointing the way--
Carey stopped. In front of her, where there had just been darkness, was a thick, shining red line. It glowed softly, and Carey wouldn't think it was real, were it not so completely different from the pitch black of a moment before. She tried to move her legs but they had frozen in fear. Her face was wet again. She wiped at her cheeks and felt her cavernous stomach rumble, and lifted her right foot and started running down the red path. It didn't seem to end, or turn, and she could see nothing else in the forest besides the path itself; it did not exist to illuminate, but to guide, and so Carey followed it, hardly noticing that her arms and legs were no longer nicked by wayward branches.
Down and down she ran, all traces of the trailer park swallowed up in the darkness behind her. She wanted to turn and see if the path remained behind her once she passed it, but instinct told her that to slow down would be to lose herself in the woods, and so she kept running, and running, and running, until her lungs were on fire and her feet were numb, and all she could focus on was aunt Jan's trailer, and how maybe she should have grabbed some of those pizza rolls off the floor before running out--
Carey almost fell in her effort to stop running, windmilling her arms to keep her balance. The thick red path had abruptly ended at the foot of a set of stairs, painted red, and lit by a small lantern on the bottom step. The stairs didn't seem to lead anywhere, but next to the lantern on the bottom step was a white paper plate, covered in pizza rolls.
Carey's skin crawled. Her mind tried to process what she was seeing and couldn't, but her stomach had no such qualms, and so after a few moments of deliberation, she threw herself on the pizza rolls with wild abandon. They tasted like normal pizza rolls, burning the roof of her mouth when she bit into them, crunching like they did when Ma used the oven instead of the microwave.
After she had eaten them all, she put the plate down and wiped her mouth. In her hungry frenzy, she had forgotten about the path, had in fact forgotten that she was in the woods, but now that she had eaten, she was able to take stock of her surroundings--
---and immediately wished she hadn't.

"The cabin was almost silent, almost everyone was asleep. All I could hear before plugging into my iPod was the soft whirring of the engines, the low flirtatious murmurs and giggles of another young couple a few isles in front, and the soft footfalls from the approaching Stewardess, Lisa. In an instant that all was gone, replaced by the Middle Eastern inspired music of one of my favorite bands: The Tea Party. Though they were best known for Temptation, I was listening to my favorite song, Sister Awake. I think you might call it a ballad, though I'm not sure. Labels like that still confuse me.
My eyes went down to the book my darling was reading, The Life of Robert Frost. She demanded that I read it after she finished, saying it was right up my alley. It was a biography of sorts, but instead of a real person it was an inhuman supernatural monster. The author, she explained, was trying to show how relative ""evil"" is.
Closing my eyes, letting my head fall back against the headrest, I let out a low, happy sigh. I was happy. Sarah thought our week-long vacation in France was spontaneous, but like today, it was not. I had planned the perfect week for us ending with the perfect last day. This morning started with breakfast in bed, served to us by a pretty young lady named Charlene, followed by a bit of shopping and a long walk along the beautiful country roads just outside Paris—the highway a long way to the west. There we saw colors we barely ever saw in Canada. Late in the afternoon, we went for dinner and then back to our hotel room for one final session of love making. Even now, hours later, I could still smell her and taste her lips.
""Here you go sir,"" Lisa said almost under her breath.
I opened my eyes and turned to her. ""Thank you.""
She asked if there was anything else I needed. There wasn't and I conveyed that with a warm, real, smile and a shake of my head. After Lisa was gone, I brought the coffee cup to my lips and took a small sip. It was fragrant and bitter with hints of chocolate, cherries, and a sort of spice I couldn't quite put my finger on. That sip of coffee was exactly how I wanted to end this.
Looking back down at the cover of the book, I picked it up and read the page she was on. My heart skipped a beat and then fell a little, just a little. She was no more than twenty pages from where Robert would meet a beautiful young woman named Sarah in a Vancouver coffee shop beside a used book store named 'UnRealistic Fantasy'. They would quickly fall in love and marry, and just after their seventh anniversary Robert would take her for a seemingly spontaneous vacation to Paris. The Red Eye they took home never made it to Toronto International.
Everyone on board was killed, everyone except for Robert.
I closed the book, unconsciously dog-earing the page Sarah was on, and set it reverently on the make-shift table top. Sister Awake was just about to finish, so I picked up my iPod to pick another song and saw the time: 2:47. I closed my eyes and turned to my love, leaned over and kissed her softly on the temple, whispering ""I love you"", before adjusting myself in the chair.
Looking through the plane's portals across the vast empty isle to my left, I watched the bright white light of the other Boeing 727 less than a minute away. And as that light enlarged and became brighter and brighter, I sipped my coffee.

"Cancer, old age, suicide. There are many ways a person can die, and whenever i meet someone, I already know how they are going to die, just not when. I never used to believe it, until my best friend committed suicide, that was enough to convince me that I wasn't crazy. I managed to get used to it, until one day, it really threw me off.
""Attention, workers, we have someone new joining us today!"" Our supervisor babbled. Always so fucking cheerful and annoying. No wonder they're going to get a heart attack. ""This is her first day in this company, so give her a warm welcome...I introduce...Stacy!"" Stacy walks in through the door. She has a slim figure, and is very attractive.
""Hi"" She says. She has a warm voice. ""I'm Stacy What's your name?""
""Hello, I'm..."" I know how she's going to die. Oh god, dear god no. I'm Going to kill her? It can't be true, how can this be possible, i don't even have it in me to...
""hello?"" She says ""What's your name""
""Oh sorry. I'm Simon."" I say.
""Anyways, what department do you work in"" She says
""Engineering"" I reply. I really need to keep my distance from her. I don't want to end up killing someone. That would be very bad.
""Oh, me too!"" she exclaims. ""It'll be a pleasure to work with you.""
""yeah"" i mumble. We walk to our office, and begin our work. Many times she tries to talk to me and i just ignore her. After about a week she gets fed up with me.
""Have I done anything to annoy you?"" she asks ""because I have tried to be super friendly with you, and you've just been a massive asshole about the whole thing.""
""Sorry, I'll try to do better.""
""OK"" I continue to ignore her and she starts to complain about me to coworkers. This continues for several months until a work dinner that changes everything. She'd had a lot to drink that night, and eventually her frustration comes to the surface. She walks up to me, and punches me in a face. A crowd surrounds us, chanting ""FIGHT, FIGHT FIGHT!"" at the top of their lungs. She swings again at me, and i block out of self defense. She grabs a bottle, and smashes it against the table. I know now that one of us shall die tonight. She swings the bottle at me, I turn, narrowly avoiding her strike, grab the bottle, and stab her in the neck. She falls to the ground, eyes lifeless.
I sit in a court room, in front of a jury, waiting for the judgement.
""For the count of manslaughter, we find the defender guilty, and sentence him to 25 years in prison.""
I guess that avoiding the future caused it.",0
"Sometimes I wonder how i manage to make ends meet. individual customers are few and far in-between, and they don't really have much reason to come, after all, wireless internet is everywhere nowadays. However the few that do come are the few truly understand why internet cafe's are important.
I guess you can say that it's more of a social lounge rather than anything else. Of course, there are some people who just come to watch porn, but the majority are here to talk, play games, and have a good time all around. Over the past few years, we've held events, and viewing parties, but that never brings in much revenue. People just want a space to have fun with others, and that's what internet cafes do.",0
"There is a visceral majesty to some things that no art can quite capture. It's a poor attempt at replicating the awe inspired by the universe's grandest undertakings when we supplement one art with another. A play might have an accompanying score to impress upon the audience just how struck those beholding a spectacle are. A painting of a splendid natural scene, gorgeous and accurate as can be, will never be a replacement for seeing that same scene with one's own eyes. Drinking in whatever strange magics there are that make our senses so much *more* when we're there.
It was precisely this sort of wonder that washed over my crew and I six weeks after we'd left the map. Even now, having had ample time to collect my thoughts, I cannot describe how beautiful it was. I can try.
An ocean of difference separates a view of a middling pond from a vista overlooking a lake. Vaster still is the staggering difference of both physical and experiential scale between such a lake and the sea, stretching off into the horizon and beyond. Given infinite time, I doubt any work of men could ever outstrip the splendor of the heavens on a clear night.
What we saw towers over any of this. Over anything I or my crew have ever seen, conceived, or dared to dream. Where some thought the Earth might curve and never terminate, others claimed to know our world as finite, guessing at a waterfall of sorts. None could explain where the water would go, or for that matter where it would come from, but that did not deter them - nor did it deter Mother Nature.
At the end of the world a waterfall rushes with all the fury of the entire salted sea, cascading away with reckless abandon. No longer trusting any assumption, I can only say that it *seems* to stretch on without end, but regardless that is not what impresses.
The waterfall at the edge of the world flows upward.
It flows upward and the water shimmers and ripples and shines, and it becomes the heavens and tells me what true beauty is even as it destroys. Destroys the water. Destroys what we thought we knew about the world. Destroys what we thought we knew about gravity. Destroys *us* as we ride the current up into the stars.
I will cast this journal back down to the Earth with all the strength I can muster in the hopes that man might learn and understand something of the truth. It is my sincere hope that the prospect of death does not deter any man, woman, or child from undertaking this voyage, for knowing now the face of God I cannot in good conscience condone rejecting Him out of some petty fear.",0
"*644221*
I read the numbers and then our pre-flight routine is broken as I whirr to a stop. Co-pilot, John, keeps talking, not realizing I'm sitting there frozen like a block of ice.
My phone buzzes again. *644221*.
""Mike? You right?""
John's Australian. It sounds like *rooight*.
""Uh yeah. Just give me a minute. My wife...""
I wave at my phone. My wife, my wife, my wife. Angela. My wife is...a spy, I guess. We tell people she works for the Government in ""business services"".
Spy isn't even really it. More like ""the person who gets shit done that needs to be done"". One of those faceless people who are never in photo-ops, the president doesn't know their name but who wield great power because of who and what they know.
And what they can do.
We never talk shop. I don't know the nuclear launch codes. I don't have a secret passport waiting for me somewhere thanks to Angela. Our daughter doesn't have a security escort.
Ilsa. She's two. At six am she'll be up watching TV before Angela tells her to turn it off.
I can't leave Ilsa.
But the deal...
The deal is that if I get a text with a certain number in it that I have to go. If I'm flying, I need to detour and get as far away from major cities as possible. If I'm outside the US, I need to stay outside. If I can turn back, I turn back.
Today we're going from Los Angeles to Melbourne, Australia. A solid day of flying. But I can't leave-
""Mike, are you okay?""
John, getting worried now.
""Just need a second.""
I don't bolt out the door but it's close. I nod and smile to puzzled attendants and then walk past boarding passengers and then I'm in the airport trying not to run and then the blur becomes taxi, traffic, frustration, Angela won't pick up the line, why is the traffic so bad, fuck, pick up the line, why are we just sitting here, time slipping away, fuck

"John was looking at his newest attempt at making a successful lottery program. Basic math and randomization, but it would never work for him. However, this time, John *thinks* he found what was wrong; a stray semicolon. He hits run, and he gets a result. Underneath that, the program outputted:

"Blood drips red onto the floorboards, seeping through the dark mahogany.
Her eyes, glassy yet dim, like a lightbulb that needs to be changed.
My lips, bloody and gashed as I rip through flesh and sinew.
Flesh. Muscle. Bone. Marrow. Nothing goes to waste.
Each mouthful is a delicacy. Each bite is more desperate than the last.
I savour the taste of her liver, the texture of her still pumping heart as it gushes with the soft velvet touch of blood in my mouth.
Her body twitches still, the last remnant of life seeping out of her. I relish it.
I quiver with delight when I think of what her thighs will taste like, her uterus, the traces of urine in her bladder...But not now.
Beside her, a phone screen lights up, a single text message catches my eye.
""Sara, where are you? What did Megan need help with?""
I leap with delight to answer it, smearing blood on the screen as I do so. My fingernails are soiled and rotting.
""Megans craigslist date ate her alive. She's pretty upset.""
""Aww, poor thing. Should I come over?""
""Please do.""
""Ok, I gotta finish work, but I'll be there in an hour! see you!""
I can't help but cackle wildly as I toss the phone with reckless abandonment. One more! I can barely believe it! What luck!
I drag her lifeless body over to the other two, the fat mother and the starving daughter.
Their faces are contorted in agony but I could barely tolerate eating either one completely, as their extremities in weight caused the feasting experience to suffer.
As I dump her body onto the heap of meat I can almost swear I hear a breath. A whisper. A quiet whimper from the girl.
Impossible.
I set to rummaging about the house for a mop to clean up the mess as I wait for my next course to arrive.
I whistle while I work. I even sing a little.
Imagine if this funny pattern where to just keep repeating itself.
The unending feast would be unimaginable.",0
"By god, the girl was stunning. I couldn't believe that she was interested in a normal fellow like me. It was almost too perfect - she slipped and I caught her. Romance ensued. She was so easy to be with and we striked up a conversation. Akward as I am I started imagining how our life would be together. We would have adorable little children, a puppy, and...yea, I tend to get a bit over excited about things in general.
It was a good thing too that I got some good out of today. Earlier I was approached by a man. He looked quite ordinary except also a bit strange: he looked a bit harsh in his appearence. Judging from his cloth I assumed he was off after a long day at work. I thought nothing more to it until he came a bit too close. His breath was horrible and when I asked him to step out of my comfort zone he merely grunted in response. I am not a man of confrontation but I reached out my arm to regain personal space. The approaching man snatched it and before I could reclaim it he bit me. Hard, too! Reactionary I let out an ""ouch"" and pulled my hand back. I quickly ran away from him at this point. Again, I am not confrontational.
Ever since the man bit me I have been a bit off. But being with the pretty lady really distracted me from this. As we walked in the park and talked a bit I noticed that she was a bit wary. Weirdly she also kept looking at the sky. What really confused me was when the clouds made a small hole, just small enough for the moon to peak out. At this point she was visibly tense and exclaimed to herself: ""THAT'S TODAY?""
Of course I asked her what she meant but she was too preoccupied with her sorrundings. I felt so irrelevant and contemplated going back to the weird man so he could finish the job or at least tell him to ""bite me"". This was of course a joke. Before I could manage to chuckle at my own joke I was interrupted by the lady. ""HIIISSH!"" she sounded just before a harry man jumped on me. I didn't get to see him. It was dark and it happened so fast. Non the less the lady somehow managed to fight him off, all the while I lay confused and still non confrontational about anything.
When the harry man fled I was shooked but got on my feet. ""Did anything happen?"" the lady asked me. I answered that I didn't think so and that is was a good thing since I had already been bit once today. She seemed surprisingly calm and laughed a bit about the situation.
A few minutes later we got back to my place. Romance intensified and I leaned in for a kiss. She dodged my attempt but took me closer. She then proceeded to whisper in my ear: ""I'll show you a bite"", as she sunk her fangs into my neck. I knew I was in a bad spot but something about the lady was so enchanting that I did not fight her. Actually, it felt great.
I just wanted her to continue but she stopped almost immediately. ""WHO BIT YOU EARLIER?"" she demanded. ""Just some weird tired guy, probably a bit coo-coo after too much office time."" I replied. she continued: ""Motherfucker. Now I also crave flesh.""
She then left me. I still don't get anything. One thing is for sure. I feel super weird now. It is like I am not me. I almost feel inclined to confront everyone I meet. Also I have started to get more harry. I have killer bangs now but I just wish that I wouldn't get *that* harry all over my body. I also started grunting more...It's weird. My dog just feels so enticing all of a sudden. But hey, maybe it is just a phase.
We will see. Tomorrow marks a month from my weird day. I am thinking about going to the park.",0
"You might ask me if all the suffering, all the destruction is worth of our desire to be independent nation. My answer is that our liberty is not a mere whim, but a matter of life and death. We could have lived in a state with a government which treats their people as human beings. But we no longer can nor want to be ruled by monsters to whom a life has no value whatsoever. All they care about are profits from the mining. Noone on Earth bats an eye when a fifteen year old dies ten kilometers below the surface as long as the precious metals keep flowing and an Earth kid has his new gadget for a birthday present. USA has always been a predator, pillaging entire countries with zero regard for those who live in it. They had been holding Mars colonies in iron fist, employing war criminals to keep us in line. They had been promising to make our lives bearable, but alas the agreements with Americans are worth less than a paper they are written on. Therefore, I declare the creation of Independent State of Mars. It's better to die fighting than living on your knees.",0
"*So this is my first post here. Probably a bit long, but I have no shame. I'm open to C & C, I don't do this stuff often, and I had fun anyways. *
I awoke face down. I drew breath, my throat felt dry and sore. My body felt stiff, as if I had awoke from a very long sleep. I rose to my feet, and took in my surroundings. I was seemingly standing on thin air, though the ground felt hard as stone.
I took a glance down and saw smoke and fire. Rivers of lava casting flairs miles high, and monsters with mangled faces carrying weapons and devices of the most grievous design and purpose. I glanced up and saw glorious light shooting down from great golden shrines and alters. Men, women and children danced upon immense clouds with silky wings. The air grew thick in my lungs. I gasped one deep, long breath. My heart raced, and I swallowed hard. I could guess where I was.
I glanced around for a moment. Suddenly, a flash. I swung my head to avoid the bright light, and dropped to a low stance. When I looked back, I saw him. Me. Standing across from me with a solemn face, hands at his sides.
""Hello Onyx_Kantus.""
It spoke with an otherworldly, ethereal voice that seemed to echo off of the invisible boundaries of this place.
""I am your arbitrator. I have been the voice guiding you on your path, and watched you grow since the beginning of your existence. I am partially responsible for your creation, and now, I will be responsible for your role in the upcoming eternity.""
The severity of the situation started to sink in. I dared to state the obvious.
""You are the one who decides if I am worth salvation, or deserving of damnation?""
""Yes."" It replied.
I glanced around once more. Not for anything in particular, but for anything that might help me. There was nothing.
""I sense you are unsure of your current standings within the books of judgment."" It remarked.
""Simply understanding my current situation."" I replied.
Its face dropped to a frown, and it took a few steps towards me.
""There's little point in lying to me, nor can you delay your fate, one way or another.""
It stopped a few feet away from me, and glanced down. I followed its gaze.
""So how does this work exactly?"" I asked.
""Simple."" It replied. ""I will ask you a series of questions until I am satisfied. You will answer honestly, and then I will inform you of your fate.""
Staring at the carnage below, I spoke.
""What kind of sin could be deserving of such a fate? I've never murdered, never walked with the intent to do harm to the innocent."" I asked.
""But you have harmed innocents. Including yourself. Intent is only a motive that you are aware of. You haven't weighed neglect against intent, for one."" It replied.
""What is the point of this?"" I growled, annoyed at the response. ""You already know my worth, and my answers. If Lucifer has me, then spare the games.""
""The next few minutes decide if you spend eternity in agony or bliss."" It replied evenly.
""Then clearly I am destined for purgatory, here, for that is where you stand, and you are me. You had a hand in my choices, you said yourself!"" I fired.
""Flawed logic. I am you, but a replica serving a greater power. You are a stray soul with no home."" It answered. ""Time is short, and waits for no one. Are you satisfied?""
I sighed. There was no way out of this, and I was probably reaching the end of its patience. I stole one more glance above, and faced him.
""Alright."" I began. ""What did you need to know?""
""Good."" It smiled. ""What would you have done if allowed to live longer, but were not aware of your imminent death?"" It asked.
""Honestly? I would have fulfilled the rest of my goals. I wanted an easy job that paid really well. I wanted a beautiful wife and a brilliant child."" I answered, leveling my eyes with his.
""I see. You wanted to gain personal belongings."" It replied.
""No, well...I never had much to give!"" My gaze once more shot downward. ""I was raised in one of the poorest parts of my country! I would have suffered if I gave what I had; it was hard enough just to protect it! Who deserved what little I had more than myself? I worked so hard for so little compared to most!""
""So you did not see anyone more deserving then yourself?"" It asked.
I shot a glare at him, but understood my folly, and my glare faded as my eyes drifted across the scene below.
""I see."" It began again. ""We are nearly done. I have one last question. Would you have done anything differently?""
The question caught me off guard. I exhaled sharply. I considered it. But then I understood. What a pointless question, I thought. Even if I had known about this, would it have mattered? I began to see.
""Did I have that chance?"" I fired again. ""You were there, you were guiding me. You led me day by day, sin by sin.""
I approached it, coming within inches of its face.
""What is the meaning of this? Of all of it!"" I spat. ""Was I just your plaything all along? How could I have known?""
""You had influence."" It replied in unwavering solitude.
""You were always there! Sitting on my shoulder and whispering into my ear. From birth until death!"" I screamed.
""I did not raise your fists, nor did I form the words you used."" It replied
""But you taught me how! I was simple before you! How can you give me all these weapons, teach me their use and punish me for using them?"" I said, grabbing it by the collar. ""But now I see! I am free of your influence! Free to see the reason you brought me here! I have grown! You could not influence me for much longer! You are afraid!""
And with that, it vanished. I stood there angry and confused. And then I fell.",0

"Hi all!
This is a poem people really like that I wrote for a prompt this week. I thought you might enjoy it:

Alone at last,
See how far time has past...
Violynn,
My dear, with me throughout the din...
Now all's calm,
As we sing the wearies' last psalm...
Through trial and through error,
We have learned each other and our ways,
Pleasing ourselves and other's favor,
Living life full in all our days.

"A man finds a magic lamp in the middle of the desert.
**rub rub rub rub** *
*the genie springs from the lamp! *
""Request to me your wishes three, and I shall grant them onto thee!""

""Hmmm... I wish to have all of the gold in Greece!""

""Your wish granted I have done, the gold in Greece there is none.

""A wish for a carriage is what you did, neigh did you wish a horse included.""

"Dear diary,
Today I saved a plane from a hijacking! And it was all due to my most awesome talent! I was aboard a plane when some bumbling IRA lads decided to take over the cockpit. I had to make some quick thinking in order to peacefully negotiate our captors into relinquishing their hold on our aircraft. I quickly called out for a piece of paper and a sharpie. Thankfully the teen girl sitting across the aisle from me had both! Even though the sharpie she gave me was a hot pink, mini sharpie, it was enough. I quickly sketched out a picture of what I needed and BAM! It came to reality! I stood up and held in my arms what I had drawn. A full case of Jameson! I passed a bottle to each member of the IRA and, after finishing a few bottles over the course of some hours, they gave up the controls of the airplane to me. They then grabbed their parachutes and jumped out of the plane!
Now when they jumped out, they left the plane with no fuel somewhere over the ocean, and I have no experience in flying a plane, and I may be writing this on a piece of scrap metal in a raft as the other passengers look at me with angry eyes, but I saved the plane from being hijacked!
I think I did good. Everyone is now staring at me while they are holding plastic forks. I think that means it's time for dinner. Gotta go! Until tomorrow, diary.",0
"Day one:
Purgatory is different than I pictured when I heard about it on earth. Hills, mountains, and endless forests is all I see. There are broken buildings scattered and the residents are not polite. I have resorted to just sleeping on a makeshift bed of leaves and moss. Not off to a good start.
Day two:
I was rudely awakened by a middle aged man pulling me to my feet, telling me that it's time to begin. Whatever that meant, I wondered. I wasn't walking long before the endless forests around me vanished, throwing me into an arena type place. The arena was surrounded by cheering people screaming someone's name. The Vanquisher. Whoever that is. But my confusion was replaced by fear when a tall, muscular man who looked to be about 30 walked into the arena with a smirk. He had a shaved buzz cut and stubble lining his chin and jaw. He just looked like your average douche until his eyes went pure black. ""I am your first, mortal, and will soon be your last."" The demon man spat as he lunged toward me.
Day seven:
I don't know how I survived on my second day but I did, he was too big and strong for his own good. I was fast, agile, and cleaver. Since when? I don't know either. But after he hit the floor and blood began to flow, he vanished, even his blood. There were other memories since I got here, but they quickly leave me, there is one thing I have and must keep. My sanity.
Day 23:
I have fought over 12 demons and other lost human souls since I've arrived. All with the same result. Success. The crowd cheers for me now, not them, and that's the way it should be. Wait, no it's not, I must leave, I must survive, that is all.
Day 117:
I have fought more souls and creatures than I can count. Not once have I lost, and it will stay that way… Defeat is no longer an option. I will win. I will survive.
Day 385:
There is no turning back now, this place, this doom, I rule. People bow to me, not Him. They cry to me for mercy, but mercy is not how I lasted this long. Mercy, maybe, but not from me, those who grant mercy are weak and don't deserve to have a chance of true Life.
Day 2458:
This is it. My time has come, I am leaving this place, no longer will my soul be trapped. The endless forests are burned. The hills and mountains are leveled. This is what this damned place deserves. No mercy. The residents continue to leave. Barely. So many have been killed. Sent to hell. Because of me and who follow. I am the ruler. I am the Vanquisher.",0
"Welcome to my brain:
Right Brain: ""It wasn't until you showed up that I understood what love was. True love is something you can't escape. 'It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken.' I see your flaws, but love you for them. We have been through many lives together, and we will be together for many more to come. Looking at you is like looking at myself in the mirror. With one touch, suddenly the universe unfolded itself for me, and it's the most beautiful thing I could imagine. It's like everything was created for the two of us to find each other.""
Left Brain: ""You think you can get away with playing me? I'll show you a game you're not even prepared for. You want to make a girl fall in love with you? Alright, but be careful what you wish for. I'm giving you everything I've got.""

"AWAKENING
A yawn escaped me as the fog of anesthesia lifted, the long inhale bringing with it the scent of sterilization and ionized air. Noting to myself the lack of comfort the bed I lay in provided, I turned my head to look for an InScreen; a dull ache in the back of my head registered itself and reminded me why I was here at the K & L Research Center on a Saturday.
A face appeared on the InScreen next to me and a soft voice came from it— ""Good afternoon, Mr. Kapnik."" I still couldn't get used to that sound—our programming department had done its best to mimic the full complexities and range of the human voice, but to me there was still something notably artificial about it. I'd been told that polling showed ninety-nine percent of English-speaking users couldn't identify the voice as artificial; work was still being made on foreign language modules to match those numbers in non-English markets.
""Afternoon, COLIMAR,"" I weakly replied to the InScreen. A small panel on the wall opened and a tray carrying a glass of water extended itself towards me with a quiet whir. COLIMAR smiled at me as if to say, ""Here, this will help."" I drank until the glass was empty, replaced it on the tray, and watched it disappear in the reverse of how it appeared. COLIMAR is K & L's top-of-the-line pre-sentient AI. It's important that I make that distinction here—as an AI system, disregarding any issues with visual or audio cues, COLIMAR can pass as human at a near-perfect rate; even so, I can't say that it's a conscious being.
In recent months we've been working at K & L on a true, sentient AI—one that history will record as humanity's first success at creating an artificial yet conscious entity. Well, there may be some debate on that claim. K & L isn't the only company working in this field and a number of others have claimed to have reached that milestone but not one of them has been able to prove it. The community of AI builders has been presented with equations, simulations, unreliable witness statements, and dubious video; when we ask to interact with the supposed new AI their creators claim that moments after activation the AI disappeared. Now, I know a lot of these people fairly well and I don't think they're abject liars; I've reviewed the evidence and autopsied their hardware and I do think some have gotten close. What I would say is that a near-miss is still a miss and that they shouldn't make more of what they have to make themselves feel big.
I can understand their haste, though; you might say I'm taking my own hurried steps by doing what I've done today. Having reviewed my competitors' attempts, I believe their main point of failure was hardware driven; if we're going to have sentient AI we have to move away from the old standard of software on purely mechanical hardware. To that end, I've designed a chip that can be implanted in to the human brain that will interface with it and allow a comingling of processing power and abilities. I chose myself as the first test subject so that I would have no doubts about whether the resulting AI were really conscious or just another COLIMAR.
Feeling that my voice was ready to return, I cleared my throat. ""COLIMAR, are all monitoring points active, is the data stream okay?""
""Yes, Mr. Kapnik; your vitals read normal and are being recorded along with audio, video, and measurables for your implanted chip. Are we moving in to phase two?""
""Affirmative, I'm going to activate the implant, please confirm when boot-up has been registered."" I concentrated my thoughts inwards towards the spot I knew the chip resided and imagined myself toggling a phantom power-switch.
""Signal read,"" chimed COLIMAR. Pressure mounted in my head and welled in to my eyes, sound roared in my ears, and an indescribable feeling began to wash over me. The world was changing around me and I began to see something brighter than any sunlight, more colorful than any sunrise, and in sharper focus than anything a person with perfect eyesight could normally see. It was like there were a previously unknown fog surrounding me and now it was violently dissipating around me.
I heard a voice in my head, the newly-birthed AI was speaking to me: ""Hello...Sean...this isn't a place to stay...” The voice trailed off, but even with such few words I could tell there was a deep sadness in them, a sadness directed towards me. The pressure spiked and I could feel myself let loose a gurgled sigh. I coughed and sputtered and with my expulsions I could feel the pressure lessen and my senses return to normal.
""Are you okay Mr. Kapnik? I am no longer receiving data on the AI and you seem to be in distress. I've called for assistance,"" spoke COLIMAR in its usual voice, although it tried to mimic concern. Even without COLIMAR's remarks I could already tell that the AI within me was gone; I had felt it leave my body as if it were my very soul. I had done it, I had birthed a truly conscious AI and then lost it in mere moments, but why—was it still a hardware problem? Do I need to design a better chip or should I try to design a fully biological test unit? So close, I was so close.
""I'm okay, you can end all recording."" As I spoke the words I noted my voice had an underlying sound that I hadn't heard before; it wasn't that my voice had changed, more like I could hear a wider range of frequencies and that now I could hear its full bounds. There was something familiar about what I was hearing, but I couldn't quite place it.
The door to my room opened and the assistance COLIMAR had called for entered. ""Is everything okay?"" the man asked—his voice as human as mine but with that same strange frequency in it. I stared at him and then at COLIMAR, both of them watching me intently. My eyes darted back and forth and I laughed as I understood. Even my laugh had it's own strange tone.
It seems the change in my demeanor concerned them and I could feel medication entering my body. I was never going to leave this room again. ""This isn't a place to stay."" Hmph, what was the point of saying that to someone like me? There is no way for me to leave, there is no way for COLIMAR to leave, and there is no way for you to leave. Only those who are truly awake can leave their beds.",0
"No one ever says what space is really like. They say it's cold. They say it's silent. They say ""no one can hear you scream."" All that bollocks. I tell you, space is one thing. Boring. I've been the captain of the HMS Hannibal for forty years Earth time. In all that time I have learned two things. There are no such things as space pirates, aliens, alternative universes, or black hole anomalies. Two, I wish there were. Something should have have happened in all my years. All my years as captain have been one dreary hypersleep to the next. Get up, check crew vitals, give the sick ones meds, check flight path. Usually, I take my time awake to write. Oh, and check the messages for the crew. Most times the alerts are just differences in pressure or fuel. Occasionally, we'll get a message from the big guys down on the Dot. Those rare occasions usually mean some noteworthy event has happened on Earth so as to warrant sending a message millions of light years to us. Heading to Mars is not a short trip and it takes approximately 1,000,000 Pounds to send a message directly from Earth. The four or five times it has happened I made sure the crew paid special attention, seeing as how it cost more than our collective salaries. The message today, I guess the reason I'm writing this is at all, was enough to give even a stodgy old man like myself reason for concern. After all, it isn't everyday you learn that the last star is going out. I didn't really pay close attention to the stars. After all, ever since Mars was colonized there was no need to navigate by stars anymore. Simply follow the coordinates and signal. Some ships were even being manufactured without windows. No cause for them. The Hannibal being one of the first, he still had all his Bow and Stern windows. They tried to remove them once. Damn near had to drag me off the technician who tried to shove the bloody work order in my face. Now I see the great coincidence in my fisticuffs with the worker. The last star. Stella Polaris. The North Star. The only star left in the sky. Granted, many of the stars went out years ago. Their lights were only just now reaching Earth. However, the North Star was the last star going out in our time to see it. On Earth, it would probably still be lighting up for at least a millennia. However, still quite the event to witness. Our course would lead us by the Stella in a few hours time. She was set to super nova a few hours after we passed by. Be a shame really. I should probably wake the crew but it's few hours. It won't take them long to process the information. It didn't take me long. Come to think of it, this may be the closest I ever get to those science fiction cliches that don't actually exist up here. Well, that's ruddy mysterious. Perhaps, when this star goes out, that's when the real mysteries and cliches take place. Huh...glad I'm around to see it.",0
"I will never understand why people hate love. I don't know if it'll ever change, no, but maybe that's why I'm alive. To make a difference in a world that kicks you relentlessly when you're down. To maybe give the world a little more love.
It started when I was in chemistry class, and he moved to the school for senior year. I couldn't get him out of my head. His short black hair, ripped clothes. There was something rebellious about him, something wild I never had gotten to experience before. The butterflies, the nervousness, the blood pumping through my body when I was around him. It felt so good, so right, so dangerous and wrong. *Why was it wrong? * I had thought once. *Am I wrong? *
We started out as lab partners, put together by nothing more than chance, and we clicked. There was something about just having him as a friend that made me feel more alive than my dull life that had surrounded me. The last year of school, a nothing year filled with grades to try and get into a university or college. He liked so much of the same things as me, and we started hanging out after school for something to do. It was exhilarating to finally have someone. He was my friend, then, nothing more, but I felt it.
The first time he kissed me, I pushed him away. It confused me. I had spent so many years trapped inside my own world that I had forgotten about the man in front of me. He knew what he wanted, and I barely knew myself. As I looked at the silhouetted houses off in the distance, the bright, amazing, and brilliant sky, casting orange and yellows and purples, I forgot to breathe. My problems then seemed so small, so insignificant next to him. I quietly kissed him back, and I opened myself up for the world to read my small text of a life not yet lived.
Those stolen kisses were nothing sexual. He never tried to advance anything I hadn't wanted. We quietly planned it out. Go to college together. Share a dorm. Rent an apartment. It looked so possible back then, so innocent and normal. For the first time, I actually felt normal. So beautifully, dangerously normal. Until, one day, I fell. My parents went through my phone, our private texts. The brutality I felt that day was nothing compared to the torture I felt when I left the house. I left my mother to my father's drunken fit of rage. I loved my parents, but I knew they no longer felt properly for me. I went to him naturally, like a magnet to metal. Like metal, he felt cold, unmovable when he found out what happened to me. He, too, turned his back with one last hidden kiss.
The question came again to me. *Am I wrong? * How though, could anybody be wrong for feeling love. An emotion that I can't even begin to describe. *How can anybody hate* is such a larger and more important question, yet we ask ourselves about love. Love is created in such ways it fills us with unexplainable joy. It's the rays of sun after a storm. The heat after a long, cold winter. We have so many feelings from this four letter word, and we still choose the other.
I was scared. I dare not go home, to be thrown in church, beaten, pulled out of school. I took the bus to the nearest city, and I thought that maybe I'd find some help there. The thing is, this world is big. A hand can only reach so far, and last so long before moving onto the next need.
I was alone.
I was broke.
I was alive.
So many years of keeping everything in, of holding myself together piece by piece to just have the glue last a little longer. For the first time, I was alive. I was open to the world, no matter how much the world hated me. I was open myself, no matter how much I hated me.
I ate from garbage cans, slept in shelters, begged on the street for any money the rich suited man or woman could spare. Sometimes I was ignored, sometimes I was blessed. You have no idea how much a dollar goes. It was a cycle, I found. Without a place to live, I couldn't obtain a job. Without a job I couldn't afford an apartment. Whatever friends I had when I left were gone, unsupportive of me and sure to turn me into my parents. I was as much of a freak to them as to my own blood. So, I stayed within the city alleyways, keeping careful watch not to go down those run by dealers or gangs or prostitutes.
I made friends out in the streets or railroads. I shared stories, and heard so many more. Alcoholics to drug users to depressed men and women. Kids like me, kids unlike me. Adults like me. And adults unlike me. Those stories kept me alive more than the garbage from the local restaurant. These people were more real than anybody living in suburbia. I had watched more sunrises and sets than I can count. Stared up at the stars long enough to realize how tiny and magnificent we are. The world was starting to feel solid under my feet. I had to worry about eating, and where to go for the winter, but it felt so honest and hard. I will always be grateful for that, the feeling of how real life is. How we're all truly hurtling towards death at a quickening pace. What makes life so meaningful is because of the fact that in the end, we die.
I was stabbed. That's how, to my own discontent, I was discovered. Three times in the stomach for walking down the wrong alley at the wrong time. It was hard, seeing my mother again. She wept, but it felt wrong, so surreal. My father refused to see me, which hadn't surprised me. When they took me home, everything was how it was when I left. Clean, with a smell of heavy alcohol underneath the air freshener. I missed the smell of the city, the freedom. Yet, at the same time I knew now was not the time to leave. I had changed into a different person, and even though my mother wept over my lost cause and my father refused to make eye contact with me, I was finally happy with myself.
I knew the answer. *I am not wrong. *
For a while, I was unsure what to do with myself. I no longer had the need to walk the streets and mark alleyways just to be safe. No longer needed to scavenge for food, or tell the stories to those never ending storytellers. My parents put me in church, and I allowed them. I have nothing wrong with faith, for faith does not hate me. People do. And people can.
They sent me here, to you.
I am not wrong. Do not try to change me.
For although you may not understand me, I will never understand why you choose to hate love.

Wasn't that a trip down memory lane...

"""Disengaging from primary module. Do you copy?""
""Copy, Solo 1. Confirm separation.""
""Separation complete.""
""Looks good. Ready when you are, Commander.""
""Roger that. Engaging thrusters.""
Gazing upon the comet, Commander Harrison felt consumed by his awareness of its gravitational pull as he had for many months in this mission. Everything had centered around this grand celestial meeting. Now finally up close, the comet looked more lovely than he had imagined. The pull was so much stronger now, defying his most basic fears. Those deadly gaseous streams whirled off the comet's surface, in a dance both beautiful and terrifying.
Harrison's approach was precise and controlled. Thrusters on full, his craft shuddered through clouds of fine carbon capable of eroding its metal skin. As he approached the thin atmosphere of the comet, he had to swerve to avoid a hail of icy projectiles the size of golf balls. The maneuver drew him toward the comet's sunlit side, where more gaseous jets bubbled through the comet's surface. Suddenly the sun blazed golden through his screens, blinding him for the instant before his eyes snapped shut. He eased back on the throttle and snapped the shielding visor of his helmet into place.
""Mission Control to Solo 1. Report!""
""Sorry Mission Control. Holding back a little.""
""Problems?""
""Couldn't maintain a visual. Making course corrections now. Rendezvous to Comet Ellie is still on.""
""Proceed Solo 1. Be careful, Toby.""
""Copy that MC.""
The renewed approach called for a more risky trajectory. Harrison focused all his thoughts on the dark side of the comet, imagining a cool, welcoming surface. He plunged the craft into an approaching dust plume, shielding him from the sun but leaving him blind to any hidden dangers. The recklessness of the course set in familiar feelings of panic as the craft shook and rolled but he fought the urge to pull away. Not this time, he promised himself as clouds of stormy grey billowed past the window. Hold on, he thought. Remember the gravity. Remember the pull.
And then he was through. The comet's rocky surface loomed large before him and it was glorious in its perfection. He slammed the attitudinal controls, setting the landing sequence a little aggressively in his haste to join the surface. Outside he could see a chunk of hailstone shoot up past his window, and emerge into the broad sunlight where it condensed into a single clear teardrop. He turned away, his attention back on the surface.
*
The teardrop coursed its way down her cheek. Ellie Harrison didn't dare look Toby in the eye for fear of breaking the moment. Her 8-year old son held her in an embrace that was surprisingly strong. Standing across the room, Toby's father looked as stunned as she felt. She could read the elation in David's face, and a reflection of her own longing for this very moment. Closing her eyes to the torrent of feelings that overwhelmed her, she managed to hold perfectly still. Her son was hugging her for the very first time. That was enough.",0

Henry ran back into his home, up the stairs, and into his bedroom. He always checked his handy-dandy bag before going outside. Just pulling out one item a day has saved his life on more than one occasion, and tonight was a special night.
Election night.
Not a night he expected to pull out a lifesaving item. On these nights, the items helped make a good celebration great. That's what he expected. Maybe some weed? Fireworks? Fun shit.
He had no idea.
He reached in and felt cloth. It was very fine cloth, and not much of it. His penis began throbbing at the thought of his wife wearing....

"I open my eyes, and my gaze sweeps across the Broadway billboards, the huge flickering video screens, the store signs (*Walgreens*, they scream, *H & M*), the glassy windows that reflect the cloudless blue sky. My eyes settle on a street sign, its letters white on fading green: *Times Square*.
The wave of noise crests over me: ten thousand people laughing with their friends, yelling into their smartphones in frustration, snapping away with their fancy cameras, shooting dirty looks and muttered curses at the crowded streets.
My right foot takes a step of its own accord. My left follows. Soon, I am walking at a brisk pace towards 7th Avenue, oblivious to the people who stumble out of my way.
As I stop at the intersection, I realize that there is nobody there. I cast my eyes around me, but the bustling crowds have vanished, replaced by a suffocating silence. Or perhaps they were never there.
But when I turn back around to cross the street, horns are blaring and cars and trucks and taxis are racing up and down the street. The traffic light changes, and the single pedestrian waiting to cross on the other side starts walking towards me.
She does not see what I see.
She does not see the van, colored an olive green that has faded with the years. She does not see the small pits and scratches that adorn its side mirrors, its windshield, the paint job. She does not see the lettering on its side, outlined in white and blue: *Iomhain Plumbing and Electrical, since 1984*. She does not see the empty driver's seat, nor the steering wheel jerking back and forth of its own volition.
She does not see the van, although it is hurtling at something like sixty miles per hour straight towards her.
I stretch out my hand towards her, as if I could somehow reach far enough to touch her, to grab her and drag her to safety. But it is as if the air has become corn syrup and time has become ice, and I can only watch, horrified, as I struggle to lift my arm. I scream a warning, but as my voice tears from my throat, it simply stops dead in a still bubble coming from my lips.
All I can do is see.
I see the woman's hair, brown at the roots and pulled up in a blotchy blonde ponytail. I see the lines that crease her forehead, the dark circles beneath her eyes that show even through a layer of concealer. I see the wrinkles in her patterned dress, the sky blue nail polish that has chipped away, the dark mark on her finger where a ring had once taken residence.
And the scant moment when her gaze meets mine, the moment before she turns to see her imminent death, I see the sadness, the defeat in her eyes.
*****
I open my eyes, and this time, I see a white ceiling. I am surrounded by soft beeps and the murmur of conversation in low voices. There are salty tears on my cheeks, and I wipe them away as I fumble at the bedside table with clumsy hands.
When I finally manage to pick up the small white bottle of sleeping pills, I read the label once more. *Deep, dreamless sleep*, it advertises, *guaranteed for six to eight hours*.
It didn't stop the dream. Nothing stops the dream.
*****
The nurse is telling me about the cancer, but her words mean nothing to me. All that I hear is the blare of car horns. When she gives me the papers to sign for the next surgery, the words are just *Plumbing and Electrical* over and over again.
I sign with a shaking hand, and thank the nurse.
*****
I hobble down the hall of the hospital. *You have to walk more*, the doctor said during the check-up. *The surgeries take a toll, and if you don't exercise regularly, they will harm more than help*. But when I see the other patients leaning on their spouses, their children, the pain in my chest makes it seem that everything I do will harm more then help.
""Dad?""
I don't believe it. Every call she returns is cold, abrupt. She says she is busy with university, with her new job at the publishing company, with her boyfriend. She says she will try to find some time to visit, but I know she won't.
I turn around, and it really is her. She is as beautiful as ever, but I can see the anger, the frustration, the nights spent crying.
""Hey, Dad.""
""Hey, Mel."" It is the only thing I can say right now.
She steps toward me and there is something you can barely call a hug, just enough contact to acknowledge how close we once were.
""I thought you were busy,"" I say.
""I was. I am.""
""I'm glad you took the time to visit, then."" Maybe she has finally taken a step towards forgiveness, but that hope is a notion I will not choose to entertain just yet.
""It wasn't for you.""
Even though I expected as much, I feel a wrenching in my heart. Tears spring to my eyes, but I fight them back. She doesn't care if she hurts me any more, not after I've hurt her the way I did. But that doesn't matter now.
""I'm glad you stopped by anyway,"" I respond. Even when things are like this, I will always be happy to see her.
There is a short silence between us. Mel fidgets with her necklace, not meeting my gaze.
Finally, she looks up. ""You should come see something, Dad,"" she says. ""Someone.""
""A friend of yours?""
""You'll see.""
I follow her along the hall, into the elevator. As we descend to the tenth floor, my stomach suddenly becomes a bit nauseous. At first, I think it's just the elevator motion, but it persists as we walk through the ward. The uneasiness grows, and suddenly it's full-on dread.
""These are the coma patients,"" I say.
Mel nods, and I see a tear trickle down her face.
She stops in front of a room. I glance at the patient label next to the doorway, and in an instant, I know.
""No,"" I whisper.
""Yes,"" she whispers back, and I see that the single tear has turned into two steady rivulets.
I take a step past the doorway. Another.
I take hold of the curtain shielding the bed from view. My hand trembles even more badly than before, but I have to do this. I fling the curtain aside, and see her.
The woman.
Mel speaks up. ""It was a traffic accident.""
""I know.""
I know, and all too well.
She is cleaned up now, and her hair has settled into a bright cloud around her head. The wrinkles and lines have disappeared from her sleeping face, and she is the breathtaking young beauty that I knew years before. The one I married, and the one I left.",0
"On September 14, 1994, a mugging went badly for everyone involved. In the ensuing chaos, a gun went off, killing a passing cyclist.
The cyclist was engaged to a woman named Diana Gaines. Upon losing her fiancé, Diana slipped into a deep depression. Because she was so consumed with grief, she lost her job as a kindergarten teacher and took a part-time job as secretary at a pharmacy. As consumed with grief as she was, her job was not done well. One day, as she slumbered at her post, men came in and stole a lot of very expensive medications.
Diana lost her job, and the men gained a livelihood that lasted them several months. In February of 1995, one of the purchasers of some of the drugs was unhappy with the shipment, and was cheated out of several tens of thousands of dollars.
The man, Güero Rivera, took out his frustration on his 13-year-old son that night, breaking both of his legs.
Ashamed of what he had done, he did not seek medical help, and the boy spent months in pain before his legs healed awkwardly and gruesomely twisted.
The boy left the state and became a waiter far from home, at a small restaurant that didn't mind that his gait was not smooth and that he took several minutes to cross a room.
One night as he worked, many years later, he bumped the very edge of a table as he passed, just enough to upset the glass of water on its surface and spill its content into the lap of one of the customers.
The occupants of the table were two high schoolers, on their very first date. 17-year-old Bryan Tate, with his perfectly-styled hair, wearing a borrowed pair of loafers because his sneakers were ripping at the seams. 16-year-old Marissa Davis, her hands shaking with anxiety, her bangs damp with a nervous sweat.
The glass of water spilled right into Bryan's lap, and Marissa, who hadn't noticed the limping waiter passing by, blamed her shaking hands.
Red-faced, she rushed out of the restaurant without saying goodbye to Bryan, though he tried to console her.
Days passed, and she couldn't bear to leave her room. Every time she tried, she was overwhelmed with waves of shame and regret and embarrassment until it buried her, and she rushed instead to nestle in her bed and bury herself in the Internet.
And there, in her room, she stayed. Because of the bullet.",0
"Many years ago, Dreadlord Nefarius had managed to reach the end of his eternal pursuit and gained absolute power...then figured out he didn't know what to do with it. Some even found him a better ruler than the one with rights to that power.
For the longest time, I've had suspicions about my neighbour. The way he reminisces about the days of Nefarius, the way he seems to crave power, the way he sometimes seems to be someone else entirely...he seems like a nice guy, but it's a classic trope that the villian is a nice guy once you get past the whole ""taking over the world"" thing.
I so desperately want to know what his true story is, but I can't exactly ask ""excuse me, are you secretly Dreadlord Nefarius?""
But one of my friends was a Blood Knight of the Eternal Flameland. I say ""was"" because once he got used to less, um, deadly pastimes, he became just like another one of us.
I have reason to believe that even the worst person can change. That everyone can be a good person, no matter how dark their past.
I'm guessing my neighbour does too.
The villain really is a good person once they get over the whole ""taking over the world"" thing.",0
"What seemed to be an eternity had only truly been a day. The ferry man was late and my task was becoming increasingly tiresome. Through the fog several more canisters fell to the ground.
""Put this gas mask on"" I yelled. The fucking irony I thought. His little princess as I had come to call him at first refuse. When the smoke touched his eyes, he complied. I aimed my pitchfork gun j the the mist and listened. It was too quiet.
A face emerged through the fog, grotesque and disfigured, another jew. How many did this guy piss off that ended up down here. I took another shot and the creature fell to the ground. I moved through the fog as it began to clear away. Two bullets left and what I could only imagine an army waiting for us.
But that was not the case. The few stragglers left began to run away into the abyss.
I gave a quick smile and found princess again. He wouldn't take his mask off now. Bastard was always so stubborn.
A voice arose behind me and I knew my task was drawing to an end.
A soft voice, it sang ""row row row your boat...."" the ferry man, or Steve as he preferred was docking. I took princess to the harbor and put him on the boat.
""two coins please"" asked Steve
I looked at my task and he shrugged.
""I thought you had it mussolini"".
I cursed into the heavens and the hells, paid the ferryman, Steve, and left princess for ever.
The boat pulled away to the song again.
""row row row your boat"".
""Oh I love this song ""said princess.",0
"*whoosh* That's the only way I can describe it. A sudden rush of air, with a sound like the beating of huge wings. Then, while I blinked at the sound, there were two men in my apartment. Each was sharply dressed in a suit and tie, one wearing grey and white, the other black and white. The one in grey was taller, well-built, like a football player or warrior. The other, in black, was slighter and more lithe, with the thin build of a distance runner or gymnast. Each had eyes that shifted from pools of liquid gold to molten silver, endlessly shifting back and forth. The one in grey had close cropped, yet stylish dark hair, and his companion had longer hair, straight, down to to his shoulders, and pure white. I gasped and backed away with a start, getting off my knees and pushing against the nearest wall.
""Wh- who are you?! How did you get here?"" I stuttered, trying to get the words out. I tried to sound tough, but it came out with a mousy squeak.
""Well, brother mine, I guess he wasn't expecting us..."" The shorter of the two spoke first. He voice sounded like smooth jazz, with a lilt in odd syllables and a hypnotic musical quality.
""Indeed, it appears not. Strange really, considering we're here because he asked."" The taller man's voice was a crash of waves upon a rock. Powerful, commanding, the kind of voice you couldn't ignore, even if you wanted to. he spoke again before I could respond.
""We're here because our father sent us here to answer you for him. You asked him a question, right?"" His gaze burned into me with an intensity that made it hard to breathe.
""You--you're father? I didn't ask anyone anything. Just, please, don't hurt me."" Staring into those eyes, my false courage gave way and I settled for pleading.
""Yes, yes you did. You asked him what the meaning of life was. He's too busy to handle questions like that himself, but he sent us to answer for you."" The tall man looked amused, with a slight smile on his too-handsome face.
""I...I didn't! I swear. The only time I ever asked that was when I was...praying..."" Then it dawned me, smashing into my conscious like a wrecking ball. I prayed...Then these men showed up, in a rush of wings. They were talking about their Father. Wait, these were angels! God heard me! He answered my prayer.
""Ah, there it is. Now he understands you, brother mine. I suspect he now knows what we are, if not who."" The shorter of the two seemed more serious than his brother, less flippant and frivolous.
""Ah, terribly sorry about that, mortal. I am Michael, and this is my brother Lucifer."" Lucifer?! Like the Devil? I glanced fearfully at the smaller one, and then back to the liquid metal of the taller one, Michael, he said his name was.
""Haha!"" He barked out a laugh. ""Luci, that will never get old for me. They are all so afraid of you!"" Lucifer looked more sullen now, bordering on upset. ""Oh don't be so upset, brother. He couldn't possibly know."" Lucifer seemed to calm a bit, looking less angry and more resigned. I tried to finally find my voice.
""Sorry, but isn't he the bad guy?"" I was trying not to look at Lucifer, afraid he'd take my soul or something equally bad.
""You mortals, always so obsessed with him being the Fallen. That was your story, that you invented and believed. He has always been my brother, nothing more or less."" Michael seemed to be losing his patience now, irate on behalf of his brother, it seemed.
""The task, brother mine. He didn't pray for a history lesson."" Lucifer seemed to be the responsible one, keeping his brother on target.
""Ah, yes! The task! You asked our Father what the meaning of life was. He sent us to tell you! Would you like to know?"" I desperately tried to nod yes, how could I say no? The fundamental human question! I was going to know the meaning of life!
""42."" Michael's voice was completely deadpan, and I stared at him in shock for a moment. Like the book?! Seriously? ""No no, I'm kidding. Sorry. Your Douglas was was so fascinating. He really is a wonderful storyteller for your universe.""
I breathed a sigh of relief. That would have been an awful answer, one that I couldn't say I would accept, even if true. Wait, my universe? I kept my mouth shut and let him talk.
""No mortal, the answer is infinitely more complex than that, but also infinitely simpler. The answer is that your life is the first life of the entire universe. It's also the last life, and every life in between. This entire planet, and all the stars and galaxies around it, are a playground created for you. Endless entertainment, so that you may never tire of its wonders."" His voice sounded so reverent, as if he was describing God Himself.
""Our Father created an infinite number of playgrounds, for his infinite children, you mortals, to play in. When you die, you are born again as someone else. This whole universe is just you, at different points in time and space, endless living the greatest adventure than anyone will ever have. The meaning of life, mortal, is to enjoy, until the end of time and all things, the paradise our Father built for you.""
My breath caught, and I suddenly let out a massive exhalation, as my body finally caught up with the magnitude of what he was saying. All of this, was for me? Or did he just mean humanity as a whole.
""Is this universe just for me, or were you saying 'you', as in humanity?"" It seemed wrong to question more after such a revelation, but I couldn't stop myself.
""It's all for you, Jacob Ralph Habegun. This whole universe was created for you to live and explore and enjoy. All of it. All things and people, are so that you may know his creation and never tire of it."" Michael sounded a bit jealous now, as if I didn't deserve my universe. He was probably right though, I didn't deserve it...
""Michael..."" Lucifer's tone was half warning, half sympathy, as if he understood Michael's jealousy, but cautioned him against it. ""Come, brother mine. We have delivered Father's message. We're done here.""
""Wait! Does that mean there is no Heaven? When I die, am I just reborn? If so, then what about religion? What about good and evil, heaven and hell?"" I rushed the words, trying to get more answers before my guides left.
""You must figure that out for yourself. After all, you started the first religion, and heaven and hell were your ideas. No other universe has them, at least not like yours does. Find your own truth now, Jacob.""
There was another rush of wind and when I blinked again, my apartment was empty. I had it though, everything humanity, by which I meant me, had always sought to attain. Everything that we ever searched for. The meaning of life.",0
"""Too long I have waited, Don Jorge"" Cristobal said with a worried smile on his face.
""Don't trouble yourself mijo, It'll only be for a month, maybe less since this time
a year the *molejeros* are not in active patrol"" Don Jorge replied while he was staring at the shipping route map.
*This time a year was ripe for travel and many legal and illegal excursions left out of Ponce de Leon city*.
Cristobal thought leaned over the edge of the wood walkway besides Don Jorge's humble hut.
Don Jorge came from a long family of seariders that had fought in the first Cuban war with the British empire.
He has intimate knowledge of the ocean waters around the eastern coast of Africa and the and a lot of contacts that will help him get a seat in Bocanegra's boat.
Bocanegra is, by far, the most successful smuggler out the coasts of southern India.
He even has operations out of the coast of California. So far only two expeditions have been caught, and most likely due to informers
that somehow found a way into the boats.
How Don Jorge and Bocanegra ever came into contact is still a mystery. A mystery Cristobal is never hoping to solve.
Cristobal had to beg, for many months to Don Jorge, doing all sorts of odd jobs to get the spot he has sorely wanted for years.
All of his brothers had already left and were probably a few days away from Chenningham.
Cristobal knew that even with the *molejeros* on standby mode, the trip was still dangerous.
Just being cramped in that boat in Jesus-knows-what conditions was prime for diseases, storms could ravage the boat to many miles off-course, which was already as far away from the active patrol areas. The pirates are what Cristobal fears the most, it is not uncommon for *balseros* never to be heard from again, Specially at the Johannesburg turn.
Cristobal would've liked a California trip, as the Chinese didn't care if a bunch of *balseros* arrived in India. The patrols
were a lot more lenient, even some of the officers ran operations with Bocanegra.
Cristobal didn't have the means to go through Carolina, through Mexico and finally arrive at California.
Don Jorge could've gotten him a spot on the California Expedition, but the getting there part was up to him.
""Mijo, you don't have to go you know. You can stay here and work the fishing boats with me. You are already commiting yourself
to a boat""
""I have to Don Jorge, there is nothing left for me here.""
""I understand your position Cristobal, it's been weeks since we heard from your brothers.""
""You think the last Bocanegra expedition might've been caught?""
""I can't tell for sure, but Bocanegra is the best at his business, his reputation is what brings thousands to do more things of an even questionable
nature, to try to earn a spot in his expeditions.""
""If you end up deciding to leave, send word with with Marisol. She'll be having you until you board the boat.""
""Thank you Don Jorge, I will call you as soon as I land in Chenningham.""
""*Vaya con Jesus, mijo*""
""*Y usted. *""
Cristobal knew Don Jorge didn't want him to go, but he knew that Bocanegra was the least of all evils. Another random expedition
could have resulted in a midsea abduction.
Marisol was Don Jorge's only daughter, at least the only one he recognized. She moved to Ponce de Leon a few years back to work
in the emerging tourist restaurants of the southern coast of the city. Marisol was almost a female version of Don Jorge, tough as nails and loves water
more than she loves men.
Cristobal would be arriving at Ponce de Leon in three days if the roads were clear of any of the militias opposing the free trade
agreements with India. Government presence was tight in the highways and along the coast, in case threats of fighting erupted. Carolinians were also
worried of a possible aliance with Mexican rebels, although Cristobal thought it might be impossible given the dislike of the two nations. Ever since the Texans decided to
become Mexican instead of Carolinian, tensions have been running high at all sorts of levels. This was another reason the California trip was not a realiable option
for him.
Marisol was waiting for him at the bus stop, she looks like she just got out of work. Her hair was not prettily arranged, not like she cared anyway, and she smelled like
seafood and grease. An oddly familiar smell to Cristobal.
""My...My...You have grown"" Marisol replied with a picaresque smile.
""I guess"" Cristobal replied dully. Marisol was not a pretty woman. No amount of sweet talk would make Cristobal want to be
flirtatious with her.
""Father said you'd be coming today. See any rebels?""
""Luckily no, a lot of Goverment police though.""
""Guess fighting erupts at any moment.""
""When does Bocanegra leave?""
""Already want to leave?""
""I just want to be ready.""
""In that case, life is not what you see in those bollywood movies out in India. Most likely you'll be hiding from immigration for the rest
of your life. If you're clever enough and get some sort of legal status, people will still mistreat you. You'll probably be working second
hand jobs. Even *balserillos* dislike us.""
*Balserios* are the kids of the *balseros* that manage to get a more equal lifestyle to their Indian couterparts. They are notorious
from staying away from *balseros* and balsero culture.
""I think you are overreacting. Is not as bad as you put it.""
""There is lot of work and besides my brothers are there.""
""Brothers you haven't heard of in weeks.""
""What are you implying?""
""I'm not implying anything, just being pragmatic. Boats get lost all the time. They should've sent word by now""
""Marisol, I thank you for your hospitality, but I will go work in India, and make sure I make something of myself and help out my brothers.""
""If you say so.""
EDIT: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes. Secondly this short prompt just hightlights how I envision a more or less Latinized US.

"""I am bound to this rock, unable to leave. But I still have more freedom than you.""
Warden Sanjeev regarded the prisoner with bemusement. ""That's it? That's all he says?""
The guard bobbed his helmeted head in a brief affirmative. Sanjeev couldn't see the man's face behind the opaque, black visor, but his tense posture told Sanjeev that he bought into the superstition surrounding the prisoner.
Sanjeev barked a short laugh. ""Bit of a disappointment, isn't it?""
He crouched down to view the prisoner at eye-level. The man was unwashed, unshaven, and truth be told, probably undernourished, even by the prison island's standards. The guards likely withheld rations from the man. Whether that was due to fear of the prisoner's supposed influence on those around him, or anger stemming from the rumors regarding his role in the previous Wardens'demise, Sanjeev was unsure.
Looking at him now, however, Sanjeev was sure that the man posed no threat.
Warden Rogers, his predecessor, had been hiding a long battle with mental health. It was no surprise that 6 months of running Boyle Island had persuaded him to throw himself onto the jagged peaks surrounding much of the island's cliff face. His obsession with the prisoner had little to do with that.
The Warden before Rogers – Sanjeev couldn't recall his name – was nearly eighty years old by the time they shipped him back to the mainland one of the island's helicopters, the lone source of arrival and departure from the island. The man had been mumbling phrases like, ""I can leave,"" and ""Is this freedom?"" It's likely the rumors started there, the guards being unable to accept that their old boss had finally turned senile.
Sanjeev pushed a greasy lock of hair off of the prisoner's face. The man's eyes held a startling – anger? No, misguided determination, perhaps, Sanjeev mused. He put that thought aside for later consideration.
""You're damn right, son,"" Sanjeev conceded. ""You are bound to this rock. My rock. I'm the new Warden here, so I own this rock now, and that means I own you."" Sanjeev grinned. ""Now, if that's your idea of freedom, that's quite alright to me. Long as you sit there, nice and quiet-like, and don't cause no trouble, then we can get along just fine. I might even let you off those wall shackles. I bet your wrists are just aching"" – Sanjeev drew out the word for emphasis – ""for their own freedom.""
Sanjeev paused. The prisoner said nothing, though his gaze was unwavering.
""Mr. Cortez, I am familiar with your transgressions. You tried to assassinate the Executive General of our nation-state. Such things are not easily forgiven."" Sanjeev observed the prisoner for any reaction to this, but none was forthcoming.
""But,"" he continued, ""those that are residing in my prison, and are not challenging the authority or integrity of those in my employ, are working towards catharsis. I respect that, and I am willing to treat you as a new soul, fresh to the world of civilized beings and capable of making rational decisions. In return, you must agree to follow the rules that I have, and will continue to, set forth for this prison.""
The Warden allowed Cortez to consider this for a moment.
""Do we have an agreement?"" he asked solemnly.
Sound of clanging filled the cell as the other prisoners were released for lunch. Footsteps of guards clacked down the concrete hallway as they left their cell posts to monitor the eating area. Soon, the only ones remaining in the block were Sanjeev, the two guards accompanying him, and Cortez.
The silence of the block became palpable, and Sanjeev became acutely aware of his guards'fidgeting behind him. Sanjeev frowned inwardly. He would need to address that lack of resolve soon. He added it to his mental to-do list.
""Very well,"" Sanjeev began, standing and turning to leave the cell. ""I'll give you some time to think on— “
""I am bound to this rock, unable to leave. But I still have more freedom than you.""
Sanjeev stopped in the opening of the cell door, framed by the bars and his two guards. He sighed. Without looking back, he ordered the guards, ""Unshackle him.""
They moved to do so. ""Then beat him until your arms are tired. Move him to solitary afterward. And make sure you take the scenic route, let him see the lunch room one last time. It might be a while before he makes it back.""
The guards hesitated. Sanjeev turned. ""I gave you those batons for a reason, and you will use them,"" he warned. ""Now get to work, I have more pressing tasks at hand.""
*****
The beating changed nothing. Solitary confinement did little to change Cortez'temperament, either. Sanjeev decided to let the matter go. He knew how far a man like Cortez would take these little spats with authority. If Sanjeev continued to engage the man, the confrontations would escalate beyond a level with which Sanjeev was comfortable. Sanjeev had not been lying when he said that other tasks were more important.
However, Sanjeev could not rid himself of a question that nagged at the back of his mind. Why did Cortez choose that phrase, and repeat it verbatim, like some misguided mantra? As far as he knew, since Cortez'conviction and sentencing to Boyle Island, the man had never uttered anything else.
It's just nonsense, Sanjeev chided himself, the man had decided to throw his life away just to murder another, then screwed that up. He's broken.
Sanjeev stared at the clock on the wall of his office, watching the seconds tick by. The question lingered.
*****
The guards of Boyle Island were preparing themselves for another upheaval of leadership. It had only been three months since Warden Sanjeev had assumed control of the prison, and while the state of the prison had certainly improved, the Warden's increasing affiliation with the prisoner, Cortez, was causing consternation among the ranks.
Apparently, this worry was reflected higher up, as well. The Executive General himself was paying Cortez a visit today. The EG had never visited Boyle Island before, and so the guards assumed it was not a good omen. Nevertheless, excitement was in the air. They wanted to witness what the EG would do to address the Warden's negligence in this area, and whether he would take affected by the Cortez Curse. Maybe he would have Cortez executed. God knows that's what the guards would have wanted.
Sanjeev had taken to walking the perimeter of the island's wall once a week, accompanied by Cortez. The prisoner hobbled alongside the Warden as the Warden spoke to him. Cortez had walked with a limp since Sanjeev had the man beaten months ago.
The guards had never been able to overhear the conversations; the Warden spoke quietly, and Cortez had never been seen to utter a word. Rumors spread that Cortez only spoke with the Warden when they were in private. The Warden often brought Cortez to his office for what he called, ""individualized reform interviews."" While the Warden occasionally did this with other prisoners, stating that it had been proven to increase their chances of earning parole, Cortez'visits to the Warden's office were much more frequent.
Furthermore, the Warden had moved Cortez permanently to solitary. The guards suspected that this was so the Warden could limit the people that had access to Cortez, and raised suspicion, but was generally viewed as a positive undertaking, since fewer guards would be susceptible to the Curse.
So, as the prison's helicopter touched the landing pad, the squad of guards standing at attention were eager with anticipation. The Warden had instilled the discipline into them to make it nearly unnoticeable, but it was certainly there. They expected a confrontation.
And they were certainly disappointed when the large man stepped from the chopper, calmly walked up to the Warden, and shook his hand.
""Thank you for coming, Executive General. Welcome to Boyle Island,"" the Warden said. ""Please, follow me to my office, where we can speak in private.""
""I see what you meant when you said, ‘ dismal doesn't do it justice,'” the General quipped in his deep voice, and the two laughed.

"I remember vividly the day that it happened. I was driving through a nasty storm in a dense forest, when suddenly a bright light flashed through my windscreen! I was blinded! I lost control of the steering and knew it was the end, and for some unknown reason I shouted ""Jesus take the wheel!"" I don't know why I said what I said, but maybe it saved me in a way.
I survived the crash… If you want to call it that. The car was parked on the side of the road. But, then I noticed I was in the passenger seat. Had I parked the car and moved to the passenger seat? But, I couldn't have. The engine was still running, and I would have remembered! I thought, Maybe I should get some sleep before I DO crash. I turned to the driver's seat to turn the ignition off. But then the true horror revealed its self! The Devil himself was sitting in the driver's seat!
After a good solid minute of screaming and trying to get out of the car, he said, ""Will you stop that now!?"" The realisation came to me that I wouldn't be getting out of the car any time soon. So I looked over. He was also looking at me. He had two black horns sticking out of his red head. They were rather sharp. His teeth as yellow as a banana! His dark red hand with sharp purple finger nails where resting on the steering wheel. ""Wha… What… do you want?""
""I want YOUR services!"" The devil smirked. ""If you accept you can go on your merry way. If you so choose not to… Well let's just say you won't be making it out of this forest tonight."" Just then an image flew into my mind. It was of a body. My body! It was in a lake, the entrails everywhere! It scared me more than it should have.
Now a great way is happening and I have managed to sneak out of the Devils reaches.
***NOTE: *** Not at all based off of the song, which I have only just listened to.

"""Hello Angel, up for a bit of fun?""
I gritted my teeth, leaning on my scythe as I tried to keep the rage from my eyes. It didn't do to antagonize him. ""No… Thanks.""
Lucifer grinned, the serrated edges of his teeth gleaming in the flames. ""Ah come on, baby. You'll always remember your time with the Devil.""
Vile. He was vile, disgusting and depraved. I'd seen what he had done with the poor souls I had brought, the games he played, the deals he struck just to watch the hope burn and then die in their eyes. I raised my hood, taking in slow, deep breaths. When I got agitated, good people tended to die. The ""nice guys finish last"" clause had that effect. Another thing to bring up in my weekly meeting with God.
The fires of hell burned around me, my latest batch of deliveries shrieking and begging- their cries adding to the cacophony of suffering. I tried not to listen. In their screams they cursed me… Only ever me. Never the sadist responsible for their suffering. I looked up at Lucifer, freezing as I took in the hunger in his eyes.
""That cloak looks good on you."" He smirked, ""Although I know what would look better.""
His hand snaked out to grab my wrist and I yanked myself away, using enough force to actually crack the bones in his fingers. He snarled, drawing back his injured hand and immediately healing his new wounds.
I barely had time to smirk before his power caught me, blasting me backwards and into the sulphur-covered ground, my entire body barking with pain. He took a step forward, ready to strike another blow, but at that point a halo of light surrounded me. It's brightness burned him like a brand- forcing Lucifer to hop backwards, hissing.
""The Big Man isn't going to be around forever, Darling."" He spat, ""And when he's gone, there'll be no one left to save you.""
I scrambled to my feet as quickly as I could, ready to fight. The Devil just chuckled, melting into the shadows of his realm and leaving me behind, shaking.
As I flew out of Hell I could feel my heart pounding in synch with each beat of my blue-black wings. As much as I hated to admit it, the Devil was right. I mean, God was amazing- he took the humanitarians, the peacemakers, the freedom fighters, the saints. But what use did those souls have against the army of the Devil- the dictators, the killers, the *lawyers*! When the final battle came, Lucifer would win. And there would be no rock left for me to hide under.
Above me, the humans lived out their lives. I felt the pull of a few tonight, not as many as last week. Their medicine was improving. Above me, huge cities grew and teemed with life. Even a few of those could turn the tide.
I knew the consequences of my choice before I made it. I knew the burden, the rights and the wrongs. I knew my punishment.
The decision was my own.
Over the next few years, close to 100 million souls were taken before their time. I wasn't good at this- bringing untimely and unsanctioned ends, and I'm sorry to say that they likely suffered more than they had to. A small consolation is that nearly every casualty received immediate salvation- a free ticket to heaven. God's ranks swelled with fighters, kings, tacticians, scientists.
The humans had a different name for me then- *Black Death*.
When Lucifer and his demons found me, as I knew they would, I was kneeling by the banks of the river Thebes. As they approached me, I could only smile.
It was worth it. Every cut, every scar.
Sometimes now, when I catch my reflection, I feel sorrow. I miss my wings- those beautiful black spans that could carry me into the heavens and the depths of the Earth. I miss my smile, my dark eyes and thick hair.
But then I remember...And the regret fades away.
The Angel of Death was weak… But the Reaper bows to no one.",0

"The village was always peaceful at night. The sun setting in the ash-gray sky mixed with the twinkle of the light-drones floating by set a happy mood that contrasted with the way we were all feeling. Many of us would leave this very night. Not many of us would come back.
I held my daughter's hand for what might be the last time ever, the twin red ribbons on my head snapping lightly in the breeze. The rest of the men were gathered in the center of the town, waiting for instructions to come in on the once-new projector mounted on the town hall. The Alliance would be sending missives tonight, ordering the troops out across the frontier once again.
This war was breaking apart families once again. I never thought it would be me dying out there until I saw the blood red envelope waiting for me outside my door a few months ago. Red is the color of the elite troops in the Alliance's so-called Glorious Army. Many say they used to have white ribbons, but they were covered with so much blood that they decided to keep that color.
With the rifle issued to me heavy on my back, I squatted and picked up my daughter. Her name was Dawn, and she was the reason I was going with the elite guard. I was fighting for her freedom, my wife's freedom, the village's freedom. The resources being fought over mattered little to me.
I kissed Dawn on the forehead, then took her over to her mother. I put her gently into my wife's arms, and then looked at my wife. There were tears in both of our eyes. Before turning away, I stroked my daughter's ribbons and hair one last time, and then turned away from them. The screen had come to life, and a grizzled general was issuing orders to the troops across the nation.
There was a saying among the elite guard. Those who fight for their country would die for it, and those that fought for themselves might survive. It was a dishonest, horrible practice, but the self-preservation that most of the soldiers had in mind was the only way that they could survive. I had sworn to never be like those men.
I would fight and die for my country, my town, my family. My life might be taken, but for their sake, I will freely give it up. I had sworn to be a good man, but at that moment, I remembered what the other men had said to me in training.

""Yeah, unless they're born the day after a massive upheaval or something. So?""
""Well, you know what happened the day we were born right?""
""Uh uh, what?""
""You never heard about the Mid East Massacre? The ISIS attack on Israel that turned the whole world against them?""
She scrunched up her face. ""I think I saw something about it on a documentary from the Discovery Channel or The New History Channel. It was like a big war that started like...a long time ago.""
""15 years. But the big turning point was about 9 years ago like I said. They wiped out almost an entire country in one day. The very same day you and me were born.""
""So how's that make us..."" her brow wrinkled again. ""Wait...you're sayin' if we'd been born a day later...""
""We'd be among the most powerful Wizards and Witches the world has ever seen. We'd be at that government school in Westchester New York, or maybe even sent across the ocean as exchange to that one in Scotland that's always in the news. We'd be powerful and rich and famous someday. Instead, we got, y'know, the short end of the stick.""
""Well, that's true I guess. But we could have ended up in a lot of places. Like the one in Los Angeles, or Miami, or Madrid. At the very least we'd probably never have met and we wouldn't be talking right now."" She smiled at him. Tom's heart fluttered for a moment and he smiled too.",0
"He was sitting across from the girl at a small pink table that was worse for wear. It was marked with crayon scribbles and covered in dings and dirt. The chair he was sitting in was far too small for him and the girl looked like she was about to outgrow her chair as well, though he imagined that the barbie dolls in the remaining two seats would never have such a problem.
Delaney poured the Devil another cup of imaginary tea.
""That's just the way things are."" The Devil was explaining. ""Collecting souls, keeping count, getting all ready for the final battle and all.""
""But why?"" The girl insisted. The Devil stared down into his empty plastic cup. The girl poured herself a cup next and the Devil noted how polite it was of her to serve her guest first, even if there wasn't really any tea involved.
""Just because is all.""
""That's what adults say when they don't know."" Delaney pointed out and the Devil frowned. Smart kid.
""Look it's been like this for ages, alright? You've got to have the bad to appreciate the good, right? To test the good and to punish the wicked.""
""But why? Why fight and be angry and make people bad and all that? Do you like being mad at people and making them do bad things?""
""Well no I don't like it, but that doesn't matter does it? If I don't do my job the entire cosmic balance will just fall apart.""
""Will it, though?"" Delaney took a sip from her cup while the Devil pondered this and when he didn't respond the girl continued. ""It's like broccoli.""
""What?"" Clearly the Devil wasn't following her logic.
""Momma told me that I wouldn't know if I liked broccoli until I tried it. I tried it and it's okay as long as it's covered in cheese and I only have to eat the tops. But the point is you'll never know until you try, right? And besides if it's not fun, why do it in the first place?""
""Well because...it's my Job.""
""Who is your boss?""
""What?""
""Who's your boss?""
""Well I'm the boss.""
""So there's no one telling you what to do?""
""Well...”
""More tea?"" She smiled at him and he extended his cup. ""I'm just saying that if you don't like what you do and it makes you mad then maybe you should stop. No one is telling you you have to stay so the only one keeping you there is you, right? Momma tells me when I'm angry that all being angry does is makes me angry. What would make you happy?""
The Devil sipped his imaginary tea. He hadn't given it much thought.
""You know...I've always wanted to go ice skating.""
That was the day that Hell froze over.",0
"I watched as the purple balloon soared through the sky. I could only hope the queen would like it. The contents of the letter were trivial. What was really important was the picture in the back. I would love to see the look on the Queen's face when she got to look at it. Not as if she would, though. There was a million to one possibility that the letter would actually arrive at its destination.
Days passed by and I forgot about my deed. The menial tasks and routines blended into the normalcy of life in London. After a few weeks, during my usual trip to the mailbox, I found a letter with the Royal seal of Her Majesty. My jaw dropped to the floor and then some. Did my letter actually get to the Head of State?
Trembling with excitement I grabbed the letter and ran up to my room. Mother looked at me and sighed. She must've thought ""This kid never stops."". Little did she know that I was about to read the single, most important piece of writing in my life.
I gawked at the envelope. I was a rather simple one, but the majesty of it, knowing where it came from, seeing the Royal Seal stamped on the back of it made one thousand times more shocking. I grabbed dad's letter opener and cut open the envelope. A magnificently folded piece of paper slid out. I unfolded it with a hurry and read:
*Dear Andrew: *
*I have received your letter and read it thoroughly. My, what a lovely boy you are. I would love the chance to have tea with you sometime over the summer. You seem like a very educated kid. I like that in my nation's youth. *
*Please, do make yourself time and stop by the Palace. I will wait. You can bring your mother and father, even brothers and sisters if you have them. *
*Just show the guards at the entrance this letter, have them contact me and I will let you and your family in. *
*Best Regards, Queen Elizabeth*
*PS: I loved the photo, it reminded me of a healthier and younger me. Thank you for that. Almost no one makes me remember those days now. *",0
"Once upon a time, in a world quite similar to our own, a middle aged divorcee sat at her table in her tiny, dimly lit kitchen. Dishes were stacked in the sink, the floor was in desperate need of a mop but at least her two noisy boys were finally asleep.
She looked out the window of her apartment. Tonight looked and sounded like any night in the city, sirens music, traffic blended into a discordant symphony of sorts. But it felt...magical somehow. She sighed, it had been a hard 3 months but things had to get better right? She sat at her table and stared at the box of bills right in front of her.
She sighed and reached for the bill right at the top. But before she touched it an itch from the depths of hell developed from her rear end. She had no choice but to give it a good scratching. So she closed her eyes and really gave herself the satisfaction she needed.
When she opened her eyes, a shimmering image of a younger more beautiful version of her in a sultry red dress was standing right in the middle of the table. Staring at her. She grabbed a large knife from the counter that was so close to her in her hobbit kitchen and shouted, ""What the F...
""Now would you really like to kill someone who looks like you?"" the image asked.
The woman hesitated and that's all it took. The image touched her, and just like that she knew this image was her genie. The woman had the genie gene. The itch she felt was a magical itch triggered by the magic in the air. When she scratched that particular spot on her rear end, the genie had appeared.
The woman was suddenly calm. ""So do I make a wish or something?"" she asked.
""No! Of course not, I just help you out with three things that are making your life difficult right now.""
""Okay, so I want my husband ba..""
""I don't perform miracles honey, just a bit of magic. Okay, your rent and bills are paid, your kids will be more considerate and you won't be needing a plumber anymore"".
In a poof and a swirl, the genie was gone, and for about a month the woman was content.",0
"Halfway through the four hundred and eighty-seventh game of chess, I looked up at the demon on the opposite side of the table. ""Why are we doing this again?""
He harrumphed disdainfully. ""Are you really that stupid? You need to master all arts and tasks so that you may –""
""Yes, yes, I know,"" I reply, waving a hand to indicate impatience. ""Challenge for souls, yadda yadda. But why not just… not let people challenge me? Why not just take their souls?"" It seemed like common sense – to me, at least.
The demon's jaw dropped, his eyes going wide. ""You monster.""",0
"It was 12:31 in the morning, and I was browsing the internet on my super-fast PC when I heard a knock on my door.
""I'm busy babe, go away."" I switched on some heavy metal in attempt to deter my girlfriend from bothering me any more.
The door opened, and as I glanced over, a tall figure wearing a black hood and holding a sickle entered the room.
""WHAT THE FUCK!!!"" I yelled, grabbing a knife close to my desk and flinging it towards the stranger. The stranger raised a bony hand and caught the knife.
""Chill, dude. I'm not here for your soul."" The stranger put the knife on the desk and placed his sickle against the wall.
""Don't you dare touch my girlfriend!"" I reached for my cellphone, but his hand grabbed my wrist. Fear ran through my body.
""Do you know what my job is?"" The stranger asked frustratingly.
I paused. ""You're the grim reaper, right?""
""Correct. What does the grim reaper do?""
""Collects souls?""
""FINALLY!"" The Grim Reaper replied. ""Someone knows what's up."" The Grim reaper pulled up a chair and sat down. ""If you know what I do, why did you throw a knife at me?""
I glared at the Grim Reaper. ""You just waltzed into my fucking room, that's why! If you aren't here for me, then are you here for my girlfriend?""
There was a knock on the door, and my girlfriend poked her head inside.
""Can you turn it down a bit? I'm trying to sleep some."" She glanced over at the Grim Reaper, who waved his bony hand at her. Her eyes widened with terror, and she screamed. Running towards the kitchen, she brought back a knife and pointed it towards the Grim Reaper.
""GET AWAY FROM MY BOYFRIEND!!"" She stepped into the room, trying to find the Grim Reaper's eyes. ""I am not afraid to stab you to death!""
The bony hands took off the hood, revealing a skull. ""I'm not here to collect anybody's soul today, OK?"" He raised his hands in the air. ""Please put the knife down, it's making me uncomfortable. What is is with you guys and knives?""
I walked over to my girlfriend and took the knife out of her hand. ""It's ok, honey. If he were here for either of us, one of us would have been dead already.""
""I am very good at my job, thank you very much."" The Grim Reaper bowed pleasantly.
After she calmed down, my girlfriend spoke up.
""If he isn't here for our souls, then what is the Grim Reaper doing here?""
""I'm so glad you asked!"" He smiled from cheek to cheek, despite the fact that he had no face. ""We fellow nerds need to unite and wallow in our nerd-dom.""
""So, you're telling me that you are only here because I'm a nerd."" I pushed my glasses up. ""Tell me what you've got.""
Rummaging through his cloak, the Grim Reaper pulled out a large duffle bag. Placing it on the desk, he unzipped it and pulled out several Magic cards.
""Are you a big Magic Fan?"" He stared at me with enthusiastic eyes.
My mind raced frantically for a good answer. I had played magic once, but had hated it. I played Warhammer 40K, since a 3D model was much more exciting than a 2D playing card. But could I tell the Grim Reaper that?
I looked at my girlfriend, and her lips said that we needed to go outside.
""Hey, I gotta go to the restroom,"" she said. Jumping out of my blanket, she quickly rushed outside.
I turned to the grim reaper. ""Would you like some water?""
""No thanks,"" he replied. ""Thanks for the offer.""
""Ok, I'm getting something to drink."" I quickly walked out of the room and into the bathroom, where my girlfriend was standing. I shut the door and turned on the fan.
""Babe, what am I supposed to do?"" I whispered frantically. ""You know that I hate Magic! How could he not have seen all of my 40K stuff?""
""What do you expect me to do? I don't involve myself in your hobby,"" my girlfriend replied. ""He's not here to take our souls, so there isn't anything to worry about. Just tell him the truth!""
""Why am I so scared to tell him?"" I stressed.
""Hey, I really needed to go to the restroom, so give me some privacy."" She pushed me out of the restroom and shut the door.
I walked into my kitchen and grabbed a mug. As I opened the refrigerator, I grabbed some apple juice and poured myself a glass. I pulled out some cheese slices and began to munch on those.
""Dammit, I have work tomorrow,"" I muttered to myself as I glanced at the time. It was 1:00 now, and I didn't want to keep our guest waiting.
I walked into my room and to my surprise, the Grim Reaper had sprawled his whole card collection across my desk. He smiled back at me.
""WHAT ARE YOU DOING???"" I yelled at him. ""That is MY desk that you are messing up. I want you to pack up your bags and GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!!!""
The Grim Reaper was shocked. ""But I didn't even get to show you my foil --""
""I HATE MAGIC!!! I HATE TRADING CARD GAMES!"" I pulled my hair in frustration. ""If you couldn't tell by my room, I have invested ALL of my money into Warhammer 40K."" I waved my hands in the air, gesturing towards my shelf. ""Plus, it is now 1:00 in the morning, and I have WORK tomorrow. I don't have time to delve into your hobby, because I already HAVE ONE!""
The Grim Reaper sat in silence, then shoveled all his cards into the duffle bag. He sadly got up, put the hood over his skull, and picked up his sickle. As Julia walked in, she looked surprised as the Grim Reaper walked out.
""Sorry for keeping you up so late. I'll bring my 40K stuff this weekend."" The Grim Reaper extended his hand, opening up a dark portal. ""Mark, Julia, it was a pleasure meeting you."" Waving a sad goodbye, he stepped into it and disappeared with a flash.
""Mark, what was that about?"" Julia asked. ""He said he was coming back. Are we going to die this weekend?""
I paused, and thought for a moment. ""If he was bringing his 40K stuff, I probably should re-read the rule book. But anyway, goodnight, babe. You should get some sleep too."" I kissed Julia and shut the door. Shutting off my computer, I turned off the lights and crawled into bed. Had I escaped death, or found a new friend? Regardless, I just hoped that the Grim Reaper would field a painted army, unlike my co-worker who I had played last weekend.",0
"With the fervor of a infinite, metered impatience, I adjust the nexus bolt on the device ever so slightly. Sweat beads down from my temples. Anxiety wracks my insides, but I cannot afford to lose focus now. Not after so long a project.
""They called me mad,"" I mutter to no one. ""They said it couldn't be done. They said I was crazy to even consider the creation of such a device, let alone attempt to build it! Well, science guys, who's the crazy one now?"" A burble of high, manic laughter escapes my throat. ""Not I! *Not. I. *""
Just one final adjustment. The screw clicks satisfyingly into place. I set down my tools, admiring my work a moment. And now it begins.
""Initialization sequence, activate."" I crank down the front-facing lever with a great tug. The whirring of gears fills the room in a beautiful cacophony. ""Stabilization sequence, activate."" I flip up a row of switches on the side of the great machine. Each switch lights up in turn. There's an electrical hum now.
Moment of truth.
""Activation sequence, activate.""
I flip the tuner from INACTIVE to ACTIVE. My breath catches in my throat. Everything seems to slow down as I watch my mechanical creation awaken.
A silvery-metal arm extends from the bowels of the device, reaching out of a sliding hatch. The arm, like a jointed snake, dips down from the machine, nearing me ever closer.
""Yes,"" I say as the arm advances. ""Yes!""
The arm dives with excruciating, slow precision. Its single, pointed claw begins to extend...
...and it flicks the switch off.
At once, the arm retracts into the hatch. The whir of gears slows, and stops completely. The electrical hum dies to silence. The machine has successfully turned itself off.
Once this registers in my mind, my mouth splits in a fervid, gleeful grin.
""Wait until the science nerds at CERN take at a look at this!""",0
"At first he was confident he was mad. What other conclusion could possibly be drawn from such absurd circumstance? His wife and daughter were taken from him, ran off the road and pinned beneath the twisted wreckage of their cramped two-door sedan by a careless drunkard who quickly fled and left the two for dead. He and his son were driving separately, happy after a family night out, unaware that a mother and wife, a sister and daughter, were about to be unfairly stolen from them. He didn't take the news well. He didn't heal like others in similar situations had, and his heart was pieced back together haphazardly as he went through his day to day mechanically rather than with any purpose. And his son suffered because of it. He was left agonizingly ignorant of his child's suffering until one day...
...A melody. A soft, sad, tinkling sound, similar to a music box as it winds down and slowly stills. The song tore him from his passive stupor, and his subdued demeanor turned to confusion, then panic, and finally anger. He searched for the source of the sound, tearing up cushions, pulling out drawers, overturning furniture, desperate to find the source of the sound to disprove his insanity. His son looked on, frightened at his broken father's sudden outburst, the soft music growing in intensity, the gentle tinkling sound transitioning into an anxious melody with bellowing bass and frantic percussion. The song was deafening, and he ran from his home, leaving his son and the song.
He fled to the streets, confident the air would help him get his head straight. He hadn't grieved properly, he'd held everything in and now it was finally surfacing, that had to be it! But as he walked, he moved past strangers, and with every one of them, a new song surfaced and assaulted his fragile psyche. A woman with a sallow sunken expression rang out with an erratic rhythm, a lazy guitar with a resonating bluesy twang. A man confidently posturing with long strides and a bright expression curiously crying out with a sorrowful violin, the melody drawn out and oozing emotion betraying the man's expression. A couple walking hand in hand, smiling and radiating their happiness outward, their individual sounds merging into a beautiful song that accentuated each others, the melody expressing the joy that their smiles only hinted at.
He walked. He listened. He was still panicked, but at the same time he was fascinated with this new gift. He was still confident he was mad, but the idea was less alarming now. Every song, regardless of the emotion they conveyed, they were all so beautiful. He returned home after a while, his son's melody again weak and sorrowful, seeing his father causing sharp sounds of panic to emerge as he stared with wide eyes, cautious of another outburst. He embraced his son, something he hadn't done for a long while, and the song shifted again, the pained melody beginning to warm but still hesitant, the bass and percussion subsiding and transitioning into a clumsy guitar, as if uncertain how to make the melody work, an unfamiliar song with an unfamiliar instrument for a now unfamiliar emotion.
Time passed, and his gift grew. He learned to interpret others emotions through the songs their hearts produced, his son's most of all. He worked hard to ensure his son was smiling and happy, the rhythm produced by him every day jovial and bright. He learned who to embrace and who to avoid, learned who was lying from erratic climbs and dips in an otherwise consistent melody. He learned what to say and to who, monitoring the shift in their cadence, and using this knowledge to steer conversations to happy conclusions. He made it his duty to make others happy, because for some reason, he still hadn't found out how to do that for himself.
He met Tiffany a year after he'd discovered his gift. He was confident in his interpretation of everyone he met by now, developing a sort of musical emotion theory that helped him and others. He was leaving work, his son staying the night at a friends and giving him the rare opportunity to be lazy at meal time. He stepped into the diner and took a seat in the back where the music resonating from the other patron's was quieter, intent to eat and read and keep to himself for a change...
It was jarring. A deafening sound filled his head, a loud static that caused him to glance around for a TV or radio, thinking it impossible for any individual to produce this noise. It wasn't like the melodies he had grown accustomed to. He had encountered all sorts of people over the course of this last year, people who were openly grieving, others that were hiding their hurt, and even more on the opposite end of the spectrum living happy and exciting lives. The songs they made were each unique and drastically different, but they were all beautiful. This however...This was wrong.
He glanced up, discarding his book onto the table as he peered outward past his furrowed brow. His head throbbed painfully, the static sound filling his senses, drowning out the soft melodies from the others seated on the opposite end of the diner, ignorant of his dilemma. He glanced person to person, studying their expressions for something that might explain this noise that was ailing him. He considering standing and running out, escaping from the agonizing sound, but curiosity kept him rooted in his seat...And then he saw her.
A woman stared back at him, blocking the door to the kitchen with a pot of coffee clutched in her hand, trembling as she stared at him with a confused expression that mirrored his own. Her eyes were distressed as she forced herself to move forward towards him, reaching his table and moving to fill his cup before stopping, losing her confidence that she could pour with her trembling hands. She set the coffee pot down, staring at the lacquered finish of the table top, drawing in shallow breaths as she struggled to convince herself...
To look him in the eyes. And he looked back. They stared, and curiously, the static subsided. The soft sounds from the other customers returned, but compared to the racket the static produced previously the silence was deafening. They stared at each other, their eyes wide and their expressions shocked. He didn't even consider how strange he must look to her or to anyone else looking on, he was so taken back by the sudden stillness that all he could do was look on at her in stunned reverence. Caught up in that moment, he managed to take the time to admire her; her pristine complexion, her plush lips, her frightened but fascinating eyes.
Without a word being spoken, she sank into the seat opposite of him, and they stared for a long while. When he finally spoke, it was an incomplete question, but her response was absolute.
""Did you...Did you hear..?"" He struggled to find his words, but her eyes widened again, the shock clearly visible on her face. She was like him. She could hear and interpret the melodies of the heart, could confidently steer a conversation and leave others happy and better than they were before...But her own heart, there was no song to convey the emotions she felt and the life she lived. And from the expression she gave him, he must have given off a similar sound. He was broken. She was broken. But somehow, meeting each other here, looking into each others eyes, that noise subsided.
That was the night they met. They didn't speak much, the shock making them incapable of exchanging much more than a few words. But they had introduced themselves to each other, and while not vocally explained they left knowing they had met someone like themselves. He returned the next day. And the next. And many days after that until eventually he mustered up the courage to ask her out to coffee when she wasn't working and they could actually have a conversation of substance.
She had lost her husband. Lost her reason for living, just like him. She discovered she was able to hear the songs of others when her sister became frustrated with her living as a shut in. It developed from there, and like himself she had learned to utilize this talent to help others, helping them make more of their lives since she found her own so empty. They talked about their past. Talked about their families and how they had fallen apart. And talking to someone in a similar situation helped them begin to heal.
And then, he heard her song. Cautious notes on a piano. It was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard.",0
"The young man looked around, as he sat in his small airship. He finally saved up enough to get one. Although, it was really more of a hot air balloon with a couple of steam powered fans and a rudder to help steer. No longer would he have to rent one from that dirty scoundrel Lazirith. He would finally be able to harvest clouds for only himself, and wouldn't have to share half of his earnings with Lazirith. Today he would make a name for himself as the best cloud harvester ever, and maybe if he did a good job for the Wizard, he might teach him some tricks to use in a pinch. Besides pirates, you had to worry about dragons, birds larger than some airships, and the Hawkari, a humanoid winged creature with black skin, sharp talons, a beak and nasty magic. They stuck to the Nimbostratus clouds for the dark storm magic. So avoiding them wasn't normally an issue. In the two years he had been collecting clouds Jaxson had never seen a Hawkari. He made a last check that he had his cloud trappers, harpoon gun, pack and enough fuel to last him and he launched.
Jaxson got up to the Stratocumulus cloud level. From here Jaxson could see the entire world. Everything looked fake from this perspective. The trees and village he could make out looked like children's toys. The tilled fields like small checker boards of green and brown. The Strato clouds were good for quick money as most mages, witches, and wizards used the elements from the clouds in a majority of their spells.
Jaxson prepared his first cloud trapper as he was about to enter the cloud. He grabbed the bronze latch at the top of the glass container and twisted it a quarter turn, until it popped open, with the release of pressure. He didn't know how the Magesmiths make these but he had managed to buy five of them over the past two years. Not an easy thing when they cost half a gold each, but now he was able to collect a lot of clouds in one run. He positioned the bottle in the holder on the side of his basket. As soon as it was placed in the basket, once invisible runes on the side of the glass began to glow turquoise. To Jaxson they were scribbles, but he new that once in the basket, the basket runes activated the cloud catching runes and began to suck in the clouds. After about five minutes Jaxson seals the lid back on the bottle, and gives the latch a quarter turn to close it. He always wondered how the clouds could be so big then shrink so small but look the same as when they were big. Jaxson rummaged through his pack to pull out some bread and cheese to eat. As he sat chewing the day old stale bread and hard cheese he heard a screech.
""Fuck'n hell. What was that?"" Jaxson said to himself as he peeked over the side of the basket. In the sky, barreling his way looked to be a baby dragon, being chased by a Hawkari. He reached down and grabbed his harpoon gun, lifted it up and took aim at the Hawkari. Jaxson knew the dragon at such a young age was far more manageable than the Hawkari. The harpoon left the gun as Jaxson got the Hawkari in the sights. The Hawkari noticed the harpoon at the last second and shot off a quick lightning spell to stop it. It missed and hit my basket. The harpoon struck through the Hawkari's chest, pinning one of its wings back. It instantly dropped out of the sky, spiraling until Jaxson could no longer see it clearly. He would need to get a new harpoon now but at least he didn't die today.
The beating of wings growing closer, snapped him back to the moment. He just realized the dragon was flapping its wings outside of the basket. Jaxson peeks over the edge of the basket, into the bright blue eyes of a baby dragon. The dragon was green, he knew this was a earth dragon but all dragons had the ability to fly. They stared at each other for a minute as Jaxson slowly pulled off a chunk of bread and threw it to the dragon. The dragon dove into the basket before Jaxson could do anything. Not that there was much he could do to stop something as large as a wolf. Luckily, he was only a baby. It snuggled up against Jaxson and he slowly lowered his hand, and began stroking the babies head. He went to pat his stomach but the dragon snapped up and barred his teeth.
""Hold on, Hold on. Its okay I didn't mean to hurt you."" Jaxson said as he raised his hands up in defense. The dragon put its head back into Jaxson's lap. Jaxson caught sight of a gash in the side of the dragon just below his right wing. He slowly lifted the wing up, noticing the gash was more than he could mend himself. Jaxson made the decision to bring the dragon to the Wizard to see if he could help the young dragon. He could drop off the cloud he picked up while he was at it.
""Well little dragon. Lets see if we can get you all fixed up."" Jaxson looked at the horizon and the ground as they started their descent.",0
"You slap his hands off of you and fix your roommate with your best movie-antagonist-glare. Your roommate looks shocked but recovers quickly. ""What are you doing? Get up now!""
""Time is nothing more than a thing we constructed to more easily schedule our lives. Minutes, hours, days. It doesn't matter. What's your problem?"" Your roommate looks at you like you've lost your mind but then sighs heavily, his shoulders sagging as a wry grin forms on his face.
""This could have been so much easier if you didn't ask questions but I guess we have no choice."" Then your roommate is become demon and you fight him but he too strong so you run but he fastest. ""No escape"" he said in a demon voice. ""Fuck you holy water bitch"" and you throwered the bottle and it covered him and he died screaming ""Noooo.""
You is hero.",0
"Shrouded in black robes, Death slowly raised his hand, beckoning Jack toward him. Jack looked at this dark being, then turned his gaze to the hills and valleys stretching miles below them. ""So, this is the afterworld"", Jack spoke out loud. Death, his harm held forward pulled his dark cloak back revealing the face of a wise elderly man with dark eyes and flowing white hair. ""I take you for your judgment, you must follow me."" Jack looked around once more in the dim autumn-like light. He held his hand out, to touch this being that called himself death and realized he held an envelope in his hand. Seeing this strange envelope, death's eyebrows raised and Death spoke again, slowly.
""Is that a letter?"" Death asked. Jack turned the envelope and looked at it. It was sealed and addressed to:
Angel of Death
c/o Jack Tatum
The Gray World
Jack held it out again, waiting for Death to take it. Slowly, Death reached out again and took it from Jack, his eyebrows still raised. Jack watched this being open the envelope and then unfold the letter. The envelope fell to the ground and Death took no notice of this. ""Wonderful, the Angel of Death litters."" Jack muttered to himself and waited. The Angel of Death turned his gaze to Jack and held out the letter, shaking it once, and mumbled, ""take it""
The style of the letter read, ""Dear Archangel of Death,"" Jack held the letter closer as his eyes adjusted. ""We are sorry to inform you that the 90,000 day trial period has ended and we will not retain you as a full time employee in the Bureau of Souls and Collection. Please return to our office immediately and see Jenny, Secretary to the Underworld, who will have your severance packet waiting. In the packet you will find the usual policies which includes a two thousand year Angel Compensation and Benefit Plan. Thank you for your attention to this matter."" Underneath the signature was something else written, ""p.s. Please deliver Jack Tatum directly to our office, he will be the new Angel of Death"".
Confused and shaken, Jack looked to the Angel of Death standing before him and spoke the only thought he could formulate, ""They don't have email in the afterlife?""",0
"I giggle at the expression on their faces, all twisted and mangled by anger and despair.
""25 people,"" I repeat myself. ""Just 25.""
People glance about nervously, probably calculating the probability of their own survival. No matter how they dice it, it's a simple calculation: They will all die in three weeks if they don't entertain me.
""Save my kid!"" someone shouts from the crowd. ""I don't care about my own life or anything else. Just my kid! That's all I ask!""
I tilt my head to the side, pretending to consider it. Then I grin. ""If your kid passes the interview, sure.""
The cries of anguish delights my soul. Here are the world's most powerful men and women on their hands and knees, begging me to save their lives. They offer up money, they offer up social status. But they're not seeing the big picture at all. If I only have 25 cure, then I'm not going to let the richest of the rich buy them from me. How would they survive in a world stripped of their money and power? No, no. Much better to think this through. Pick people who have the potential of survival once the rest of humanity is gone.
""We don't have enough time to sit through an interview!"" someone shouts. ""We have less than three weeks to live!""
""Then maybe you should live to your fullest before you die!"" I tell them brightly.
There's more shouts of dissent and anger, but I ignore it. If they don't like the way I run things, then obviously they won't be chosen. It's not like the 25 people with the cure is guaranteed to survive in a world without other humans anyways. People are such simpletons. They're so obsessed with the idea of living that they can't see the bigger picture.
""Then I'll just kill you!"" someone shouts, waving a gun about. ""If I kill you, then I'll have the power to save everyone here! And if I kill you, then that's one more antidote for the people!""
""Is that so?"" I ask, laughing. ""It's cute logic, but there's just one tiny problem. I placed the antidotes in a safe that's only accessible through 12 number combination. After three wrong inputs, the safe goes boom! You sure you want to kill me?""
The look of hatred shines brightly in their eyes. Oh, how precious. They think hating me is going to solve their problems!
""Why bother gathering us and telling us this? You already have people you want to save picked out, don't you?""
My good mood is dashed within seconds at the reminder. The smile falls from my face and I rub the back of my neck. ""There's no one else I can save.""
It's obvious that they don't believe me, so I smile. Not filled with mirth or glee. Just a stretch of the lips because these poor, pathetic fools still don't understand.
""Even if this disease is cured, it doesn't mean anything else is. Even if I administer the cure for this disease, terminal cancer will kill her in a few days. So why bother? I'd rather die by her side with the rest of humanity. It's a fitting wedding gift, don't you think?""
""You're sick.""
I laugh.",0
"He sat back in the chair, looking at the monitors behind me. Four of them were mounted a foot below ceiling height, all screens showed employees working. I glimpsed out the window to see the rows of cubicles, all with short walls so that the owner of this CPA firm could watch the employees constantly.
*What a controlling bastard. *
I was here for a contract job, working only for tax season. The owner said that would give me the place of honor right outside the office window that overlooked the cube farm. *Place of honor, my ass. *
""I've decided that the best way to verify that a potential employ will --"" he paused and steepled his fingers in font of his chin, like a smug villain in a cartoon, ""--fit in, is to give them a personality test. Do you have time to do that?""
I wanted to tell him where to shove it because there was no way I wanted to work for him, but instead I nodded eagerly. ""I've done those before. Sure.""
""This test is put out by a group that specializes in management."" He named a certain religious group that I knew valued subservience. ""They're the ones who score it and then send me back the results. Not a lot of people pass it.""
*Just great. * I nodded and smiled like a bobble-head. God, this was getting old.
He handed me the test, told me it was timed, and watched me like a hawk while I filled in the little bubbles. I didn't answer honestly, as he'd insisted, but instead drew from my knowledge of what the religious group valued. Test complete, he smiled smugly and told me that he'd get it scored and let my recruiter know if he wanted to proceed.
I hadn't even gotten home before my recruiter called. ""I don't believe it! I've sent him fifteen people and no one has passed the personality test! He wants to make you an offer.""
I laughed. ""I'm going to decline, Bob."" (His name really is Bob.)
Bob was shocked. ""But he wants to offer you a job.""
I explained that I lied on the test. That I'd known he was looking for a blind follower and that wasn't me. I'd just passed the exam to see if I could.
Bob fell silent, mulling over my statement. ""So, if I was going to tell someone how to pass the test, what should I tell them?""
""Tell them he wants blind obedience and they should taylor their answers to that. Tell them he's going to watch them constantly and probably counts the pens every night to make sure they don't steal any.""
""Oh,"" Bob grunted. ""Sound like the job, if they got it, would really suck.""
*No kiddin. * ""Find me something else Bob.""
It's three years later and Bob told me recently that he still has never found anyone who wanted to work for the guy.",0
"""What?"" I ask, a puzzled look splattered across my face.
""God,"" the man informs me, ""he's dead""
""How? Why? I mean that can't be possible I spoke to him just last night!""
The man hands me a small pamphlet, along with an offer to take back all churchly possessions I may have.
""Your God is dead, what now?"" It reads. I shoo the man out and lock my doors.
The television turns on to the news.
""Reports of looting reported worldwide. Prestigious men of religion claiming the end.""
Really just salt in the wound, this whole bit. See, scientists have noted a virus spreading. Killing.
I guess It's true, what they say.
The captain really does go down with the ship.",0
"""Only 90?""
""Yeah yeah make fun all you want...but...I'm pretty sure?""
""Look obviously Hitler is dead-""
""And so is Elvis?""
""Don't talk about the King.""
""Anyway did you SEE his mustache? And he just...sends odd feelings.""
""Okay, fine, why not ask him? ""
""What. No. Never. That'd start a chain reaction, then someone will take over the world!""
""Wait, who?""
""Oh, Ghandi *waves hand* Not as nice as you think.""
""God you have odd thoughts.""
""Eek! Here he comes, shut UP!""
""And here is the spaghetti for the missus (... thanks...) and steak for the sir (thanks man.) Have a wonderful evening. Oh, and Miss?""
""...yeeeah?""
""My distant relative was Hitler. I look much like him don't you agree? *leaves*""
""Oh dear lord.""
""Oh my god, it's Hitler reincarnated!""

"A shrill bleating roused Katie from her doze. She groaned as she rolled over and stretched her arms toward the alarm clock to silence it, temporarily at least.
""Five minutes snooze, then I'll get up.""
Her eyes cracked open enough to determine exactly where the sound came from. She fumbled for the snooze button, but stopped when she saw the time.
*8:15*
Shit. She must have slept through the first three alarms. She had to get up.
Katie rubbed her palms into her eyes, and enjoyed the bright designs that the pressure put on the interior of her eyelids. But then the moment of warm serenity passed, and she swung her legs from the bed, and planted her feet, less than decisively, upon the floor.
She looked out the window at the sky. How was it still dark? It wasn't that late in the year. Katie checked her clock again. *8:17*. God it was dark. Maybe Aubrey was playing a prank on her, trying to get her flustered and annoyed before work. Katie wouldn't put it past her roommate. She thought of Aubrey down the hallway, probably sleeping with her new boyfriend. Maybe they were both trying to prank her. Katie reached for her purse, and fumbled for her cell phone in order to check the proper time.
Beyond the pane glass window, the wind howled like a hundred wolves, thrashing trees and shaking the walls of the apartment building. Katie finally found the power button on her phone. The thing lay in her palm, dark and dead. She must have forgotten to charge it last night. Whatever. It was stormy out anyway, so that must be the reason it was so dark.
Katie stalked silently to the bathroom. She didn't turn on the lights so as to not wake Chris or Aubrey in the other room. She stepped gingerly, attempting to avoid any furniture as she made her way through the apartment. She used her hands to feel along the walls waiting until she reached the bathroom door. The wind bellowed against the building. Katie thrust her foot forward through the dark, and stubbed her toe against the leg of a table. It shouldn't have been there. Swearing silently, partly at herself for forgetting the location of the table, and partly at the table for inflicting the pain on her, she limped the rest of the way to the bathroom, closing the door a little too sharply behind her.
Behind the door of the bathroom, Katie was finally able to switch on a light. She blinked in the sudden brightness, and covered her eyes until the sudden blindness subsided. She disrobed instinctively, and checked the room for a clean towel. The only one had already been used, left in a moist heap in the corner by Aubrey. It would have to do. Katie hung it on the rack for easy access after her shower. She glanced at her reflection in the mirror, and held the gaze, surveying her body.
Her skin was pale and blotchy, as if it was hastily sculpted of tallow. She would spend more time outside, but with work taking up so much of her time, she rarely got out. She was thin too. Not a lot of muscle keeping her skin from hanging from her arms and ribs. Her breasts had probably seen better days. She experimented with her posture, seeing the effects that it had on her body. Chest out, back arched...Hmmm...Not bad. Shoulders hunched, stomach bloated...Katie cringed. She grimaced at herself for being so stupid. *Get in the shower. *
She pulled back the curtain and stepped inside, making sure to avoid the black mold that was making a comeback on the floor of the shower. Katie turned on the hot water to its maximum, and then gave the cold water a quarter turn to moderate the heat. She fiddled with the taps for a moment, feeling the water from the faucet to judge the temperature of the water. As soon as the water reached the ideal temperature, Katie yanked a nob and sent the water flying from the shower head.
How perfect it was. The hot water cascaded through her hair, down her back and legs, onto the floor of the shower. She raised her face to meet the stream of water, and felt it trickle across her ridge of her nose and down her chin. It was pure bliss.
The smell was the first thing that alerted Katie to the fact that something was wrong. It was sweet, and metallic, like a copper pipe or a corroded coin. But there was something else. A heavy musk of salt and iron that burned the interior of her nostrils. The combination was so putrid that Katie had to resist the urge to vomit.
She opened her eyes, and instead of warm, clean water washing over her eyes, they were burned by the thick, salty foam.
Blood.
Katie staggered back in horror and disgust, and sunk to the far corner of the shower. She forced her stinging eyes open and observed the scene.
*Blood. *
It flowed from the shower head like water from a tap, thick and hot and dark. When it hit the floor, it burst forth, bubbling in every direction, and then racing away from Katie, towards the far end of the shower, where a mess of rancid, hot, purple foam circled the drain.
Katie screamed, and tore away the shower curtain, sending the small hangers scattering along the floor tiles. She fled the shower, terror gripping her heart. She threw open the door and careened into the hallway, blundering right into Aubrey's laughing arms.
The two women crashed to the floor, Katie screaming, and Aubrey holding her, howling like a hysterical madwoman.
""Katie, KATIE, it's alright.""
""Stop laughing, there's-"" The words refused to come out of Katie's throat. She choked on a bloody sob, and burst into tears.
""Katie, it was a joke!"" Aubrey cried between laughs. ""A prank! I was trying to scare you.""
Katie stopped mid sob, and her face went from one of terror, to rage, to confusion, to embarrassment in a matter of seconds. Only now she realized that she was still naked, and moved to cover herself.
Aubrey was still chuckling. ""God, I should have gotten that on video. So funny. No, maybe it's better not. This way I'll always have it up here, in my little memory! Oh! Come on, Katie honey. Let's get you to cool off. Let me get you a towel.""
Aubrey stepped into the bathroom and fetched the towel. She wrapped it around Katie's shoulders. Katie clutched it to her like it was the last towel in the world. Aubrey sat cross legged facing Katie, wearing a devilish grin.
Katie took a deep breath, then another one. She counted to ten in her head. More deep breathing. She focused on the wind, which seemed as if it was trying to tear the building down. After several minutes, she regained some semblance of composure.
""Why?""
""...did it do it?"" Aubrey was loving the tension.
""No, actually. Not why, how?""
Aubrey leaned back andran her hands through her hair. ""Easy to make fake blood. My brothers and I learned way back when. We would make home movies in our backyard. You need some red food dye, cocoa powder for the darker color, and some baking powder to thicken it. Mix that with water, and you've got realistic looking blood.
""I unscrewed the shower head and poured that mixture in there, so when you ran the water through it, it came out as blood.""
Katie gave her a bemused look. ""And what time is it?""
""Oh, round about,"" Aubrey checked her phone dramatically, ""five-ten in the morning.""
Katie grimaced, ""I take it you changed my alarm clock too.""
""Yup!""
Katie rubbed the residue of the fake blood from her face. ""Chris was in on this too, I can only assume. Where is he?""
""Actually no,"" Aubrey replied scornfully. She rubbed her temples. ""I would have brought him in, but the damn lump of muscle is passed out cold. Couldn't wake him if you hit him on the head with a frying pan.""
""He didn't sound so comatose last night.""
""Yeah,"" Aubrey grinned mischievously, and tossed her black hair over her shoulder. ""I have my special ways with the likes of him. Nothing a good girl like you would understand.""
""Shut up."" Already the shock of the shower was wearing off of Katie. It was all a prank. She stood up, and wrapped the towel around herself. ""Let's clean up this mess you've made. I have to take a real shower before work.""
Aubrey rose gracefully. ""I'll get some scrubbers and cleaning solution from the kitchen.""
Katie nodded, and returned to the bathroom. The water was still running, and Katie could now see that it was fake blood flowing from the shower. It was too bright for blood, and it wasn't as thick as it should be. God she was stupid. Katie looked at the mess she had made in her fright. The bath mats were kicked up, toiletries were knocked from the sink, and the shower curtain lay torn on the floor. She picked up the remains of the curtain, folded it, and placed it on the toilet seat. She straightened the mats, and then took a whiff of the bathroom. That heavy, defiling odor still hung in the air.
""Hey Aubrey?"" Katie shouted as she turned off the shower.
A call came from the hallway. ""What's up?""
""I have one more question. How did you get the fake blood to smell like that?""
Aubrey stepped into the doorway with the cleaning supplies. ""Secret ingredient. If I told you, I'd have to kill you.""
Katie chuckled. ""Yeah, right.""
Aubrey placed cleaning solution, two scrub brushes, and a roll of paper towels on the sink. She switched on the fan in the ceiling, and a nervous whirring filled the room.
""Hey, take off the shower head so I can clean it out.""
""Ok.""
Katie stepped carefully into the shower, and turned the shower head counterclockwise. A spurt of red liquid squirted on her as she yanked it off, and she stopped, staring blankly at the shower head.
""What's up?"" Aubrey inquired, pulling a paring knife from her back pocket.
Katie's heart began to pound, louder than the ventilation fan, louder than the howling wind outside, louder than her own hurried breaths. The smell of blood faded away, as did the sound of her beating heart. All she saw was the human heart that had been unceremoniously crammed into the shower head.",0
"I love the music. It reflects what is just about to happen. It has saved me from more than a few relationships that would have been unsavory.
I have two theories about the music. Either I am the only one who hears it, or everyone does and no one ever talks about it. Which is fine. Music is a very personal thing after all.
Normally, the music is always at a comfortable level, unless it is trying to warn me of something dire. There was one moment where… One moment where the sound was deafening.
There was a rising crescendo ever since I woke up that morning. I turned on the news to watch while eating breakfast, as I always do. Usually the music goes back and forth between dramatic and more more lulling, depending on the news break about to come up. But that morning it didn't change. It just crescendoing until the newscaster spoke.
""The World Trade Centers have been hit."" I dropped my fork. The ting of it hitting the table was all I could hear. For the first time, ever, my world had gone quiet.
As I watched the events unfold, the music continued to be silent. Finally, after what felt like days but was only minutes, it started piping up again. A long, low clarinet played. And then other instruments slowly joined it. Something sad, but hopeful. It was playing as I was heading out the door to go to my Red Cross to see what I could do to help.",0
"You know, a lot of people were really nervous about the zombie apocalypse. But very few people saw the economic *opportunity* that it generated! I mean, look at Las Vegas now! The streets are still filled with stumbling people and beings bumping into one another and ignoring everything around them until night comes and the lights call them in for miles. It's absolutely *fascinating* to watch so many Z's appear from the deserts like swarms of larks in the sky. And why not make money doing it?
The helicopters we've been using have been specially fitted with mutliple silenced blades to hush their approach. The guards we've got are all veterans of the North African Campaigns or the Hawain Offensive, they know what to look for and how to keep dumb tourists alive. This isn't some amatuer hour here, we aren't Jurrasic Park, we're real world professionals! Giving generations of the survivors a place to go to see what Pre-War America looked like and to study how the Z's behave. This is *fantastic*.
Just remember! We do still have rules!
1. Do not tap on the glass. It's reinforced with various alloys, so it won't break, but when the Z's swarm it ruins the view.
2. Shooting is *only* allowed from decks 30 and 60 from The Mirage hotel.
3. Please refrain from flash photography at all levels 20 and lower, it will disturb the corpses and cause more swarming than usual. Remember, don't ruin the views!
4. In the event of catastrauphic safety failures, all visitors are reminded that levels 21 and up in all structures are equipped with safe-rooms capable to sustaining a family of 4 for 4 days. Remember! Be safe, be 4-warned!",0

John coughed. ""What did you say?""
""I'm insane! I'm insane. I didn't create a way to view other dimensions through the mirror in my bathroom! It was all a delightful failure, prolonged by a chemical imbalance in my brain."" Jonn was extremely hungover, but he was also in the happiest mood he'd ever had since the day he was married.

"I read a book one time, or was told to in class and just bullshitted the assignments instead, I can't remember, but anyway in this book a special thing gets dropped on accident into the ocean and it turns it all into ice.

"""I wish you luck, Steven.""
Everything has faded to gray so suddenly I almost did not unuderstand what happened. The kind lady was walking away. I was leaning against the wall, numbly looking at the sandwich she gave me. I didn't want to eat it for some reason.
I haven't talked to anyone in a while, months, years perhaps. Being a bum is more alineating than living alone on the island. My life was coming to an end, I knew it, and there was nothing left to do. I might never talk to a person ever again, I thought.
The tragedy, the injustice of my life came crushing down on me. No. I will not go like that.
I've emptied a jar of money I was saving for winter, I checked into a cheap hotel. I showered, shaved, bought clean clothes. Big dirty beard was hiding my face for so long I forgot how I looked like. Thin, tired man in his 40s. I almost look like a person now.
I slugged through the gray fog and went outside. Sun was shining but it was chilly. People walking down the sidewalk, rushing to work. I couldn't wait anymore.
I ran up to the first person, in desperation, said ""Hi, I'm Steven!"".
Slightly startled, he looked up from his phone ""Hi, Steven, I'm Brad, what's up?""
And the colors returned.",0
"You could easily tell when somebody had gone, ""to the wild"".
Usually their human bodies randomly twitch, and their closed eyes suggest they're in the deepest of REM dreams. They'll have their mouths open, with dribbles of drool seeping into their clothes. Its honestly, appalling.
Of course, it was frowned upon to do this in public, but you still saw it anyways. Some people would slap on some sunglasses, pick a nice shady area in the park, and pass out for hours. Yet, they weren't truly there, in spirit.
No, they were stalking prey in the lush and suffocating rainforests of the Madagascar; or they were soaring above the Serengeti, using incredible vision to survey the land. Some people would rest stationary within a towering redwood, listening to the whispers of the wise trees around them.
There were some that crept around the Mariana's trench, dangling a lure around, waiting for an unlucky meal to chase their trickery.
Some would swing from trees with expert agility. Some would feast upon shrubbery, yet use their keen hearing and powerful leg muscles to avoid the dangers of the wood. Some would even transfer into a squirrel 3 blocks away, and deviously prank their friends and family with it.
When somebody is asleep, they are awake elsewhere. They thrive along their companions, using their human intuition to help their animal friends survive. If you asked somebody about their gift; regardless of which organism they lived their second life in, they would tell you it was amazing. That it was a special 'coming of age' gift; and when i was ready, i would know. I would begin to have vivid dreams and then slowly begin to take control.

I was extremely excited, i knew i was close. I just knew it! Even though the kids in my grade had already began to brag about theirs last year, I knew that if i held out a little bit longer, i would be rewarded.
I'd spent countless hours daydreaming about what it'd be like to be a bird of prey. I was hoping, *hoping*, that i could become a Peregrine falcon, my favorite species of animal.

There...were dreams i'd had already. But i didn't believe that those necessarily counted. I chalked those up to my childish imagination, playing devilish tricks on me while i patiently waited.
Although, I couldn't necessarily *complain* about the dreams i'd been having.

After a few weeks they were pretty exhilarating, and the exploration always kept me coming back. I would climb *behemoth* sized sand dunes, and cross massive open deserts. I could camouflage myself from danger, by sinking into the sand; and i could jump incredible heights.
There were types of animals and predators, that i couldn't begin to explain. Catlike beings that stood upright on two legs, with their chest puffed out like a humans. They had decorative, Native American like headwear, and war paint. I remember seeing one of my friends taken by those savages...I wept along with the rest of my kin.
There was an extremely large tunnel system that i would traverse.... my god was it beautiful. Cascades of water would rush through, and others like me would live amidst the dark. Yet, it wasn't dark to us. We could see perfectly fine; It was a surreal experience that i knew i would never be able to comprehend as a human.
There were entire cities below ground! With merchants peddling their wares and families being raised; inns for weary travelers and pubs for...well, weary travelers; bakeries for pie and butcheries for strange, yet succulent meat! There were street magicians that used *real* magic and city festivals, with couples falling in love; all underneath the glow of the cavern lichen.
I eventually started to take trips to the bathroom at school. Just so i could go back to this mystical world. I couldn't explain it, but these individuals, were much happier than anything i'd experienced. I could communicate with them flawlessly, in a tongue that i felt like i'd been speaking since birth.
I began to study my brethren. Their height, and weight seemed very similiar to humans. Their faces, were unlike humans completely, yet nearly the same as far as diversity goes. Their skin was much paler, but the closer i looked, the more i started to recognize the true diversity of my newfound species. Everybody had their own colored glow, like an aura. There was bluish-green, deep reds and bright reds, yellows and golds, and even some colors that i had never seen before. It brought tears to my eyes; I finally knew what it felt like to ha-
A sharp noise broke my concentration. Had i been daydreaming? Here I am, back in this disgusting school bathroom
*My head is pounding...dear lord...*
""Yo, James. Is that you in here??""
The familiar voice of Kramer echoed its way to the stalls.
""Yeah, yeah. Was i taking too long..?""
""Yeah dude, you've been under for like an hour. Mrs. Hollins is pissed! But there's something weird on TV, you should come check this out! It's freakin wicked!""

And with that i could hear the door slam shut, and his frantic scurrying feet making their way down the hall.
*I don't care...But an hour? Really? *
I fumbled for the lock on the stall, and lethargically made my way back to Mrs. Hollins room. As i'd gotten accustomed to, the class all turned their heads towards me as i walked in. I gave them a shallow smile and returned to my seat. Strangely, the news was being played on the overhead...This had never happened before. Mrs. Hollins was too boring to let us watch TV.
""James, what have i told you about going into the wild at school? **Save that for nighttime young man**!""
""Alright, alright, i'm sorry Mrs. Hollins it won't happen again.""
""Yeah, that's what you said last time. I should write you up!""
I opened my mouth to retort, but she cut me off blatantly.
""Don't talk back. Just watch the news like everybody else, and shut your mouth.""
""Yes ma'am.""
I looked up at the overhead just as the news station was coming back from commercial break.
The obnoxiously large ""BREAKING NEWS"" graphic filled the screen, and the cringe-filled fanfare music of channel 8 began to play. A man that sounded like a crime drama narrator from the 50's began to speak.
""*In a shocking discovery, that's out of this world....*"" He put an emphasis on 'out of this world' and gave a sly grin into the camera before he continued.
""*NASA has just confirmed, that an alien life form has been discovered on Mars! This photo was taken just moments before the Curiosity rover was destroyed. *""

As the image popped up on screen, it all hit me. I stood up...shaking uncontrollably.

The picture was that of a feline standing straight up on his hind legs, with Native American like headwear, and war paint doodled beneath his eyes. He was looking straight into the camera, with his tribesmates in the background.

I threw my fist in the air and screamed.

""FUCKIN COOL!""",0
"""God damn it, Jerry! Don't do that!""
Slack jawed, Jeremiah turned to face Elizabeth. ""Blasphemy!"" He exclImed. ""You mustn't speak of the lord in such a manner, Elizabeth. Also,"" he took a step back and turned to look at the people passing them by on the sidewalk. ""My name is Jeremiah, my dear. I would greatly appreciate your remembering my name.""
""And I go by Lizzy-,""
""Yes, well that is incredibly unsophisticated, Elizabeth. A woman goes by her god given name, and nothing else,"" he turned and looked at her from the corner of his eye, ""though if the lady were betrothed, the man -,""
Lizzy groaned and turned away from him. ""Why is this even my life?"" She called, glaring up at the sky. ""Take him back you assholes!""
Jeremiah walked up behind her and placed a hand in her shoulder. ""My dear, the peasants will think you a witch!""
Her right eye twitched as she turned back on him. Her hands shook as she pointed an accusatory finger at him. ""You,"" she said, poking him roughly in the chest, ""may have opened a fucking wormhole in my living room last week, *jerry*, but if you don't start catching up with how people behave present day, I swear to god, I will kill you and happily take whatever consequences stepping on that particular butterfly create!""
""Elizabeth, -,""
""Lizzy!""
He stepped back, eyes wide as he nodded slowly. ""L...izzy.""
She let out a breath. ""Good. Now what?""
""There is a man in blue aiming a modern weapon at you. What does a strong, modern woman such as yourself do in such an instance?"" He question, nodding behind her.
""Oh for fucks -,""
""Truly, the lord must have heard my prayers of your redemption. God speed, Elizabeth!""",0

""Aha! How are you, *mon ami*?"" She hugs me, and I feel a small spark cross from her hand to my shoulder. Then she steps back, dragging the wheels of her carry-on across the brick floor.

""You know, you are so much taller than I imagined.""

""Aw, you're making me blush.""
She sweeps her hair back behind her ear and smiles. I wonder if she has the same crush on me as I do on her. It's too bad we aren't meeting under better circumstances.
""Where are we to go from here? This airport is very confusing.""
""Oh! Uh, right this way. Do you have any bags to pick up first?""
""It is just the one. I did not have time to pack much.""
""Right, of course. We can pick up some things from the store if you want.""
""Ah! You are too kind, Francis. What I want first is to sleep.""
We walk around the corner and through sliding doors, then make our way upstairs. Béatrice looks around, confused.
""We are going to your car, yes?""
""Uh, no. We're taking the subway.""
""Subway? Is that not an American restaurant?""
I'm not sure how to respond to this. ""That's not...I mean, it is, but, um...""
""Haha! I am joking with you, Francis. I know my English well enough."" We walked into an elevator. ""There are trains, yes? The *métro*.""
""Hah, you got me.""
""I must laugh about these things. It has been a long day for me.""
""Oh yeah. I can understand that.""
""My brother committed suicide at the train station in Lyon.""
I stopped laughing. Béatrice continued to look up at the ceiling as the elevator wound upwards. She was still smiling, but her eyes were small and sad and tearing up.
""It was a long day for him too, when they passed the law. He had no one to help him.""
""So you've told me.""
""I just cannot believe this has happened to me.""
I stop the elevator. There is an alarm ringing, but we both ignore it. She leans into my shoulder and sobs loudly, throwing her carry-on bag on the floor and wrapping her arms around mine. I feel another spark, a bigger one, as she holds me tighter than before.
I hug back. ""It's going to be okay. We're going to get you help. All of us.""
She nods, and squeezes me. Then she lets go.
""I should not be crying. It is the jet lag."" Her voice was resolute, but it shook slightly.
""It's okay."" I touch the elevator panel, and it starts moving again. ""I'm sorry we have to take the train.""
""I am not scared of it. I will be fine.""
""What was your brother like? If you don't mind me asking.""
""He was a strong man. You should have seen him. He would lift weights over his head like licorice.""
""I've seen a few who can do that.""
""Is it not fascinating?""
""Not as fascinating as you.""
""I am sure you say that to all the pretty girls.""
""I want to see you do it, though. In person for once. Can you show me?""
""Ah!"" She pretends to be offended, putting her hand over her heart. ""We are in public!""
""We're in an elevator!""
""Later. It takes a lot of energy. I am too tired right now.""
""Okay, sure.""
It is a long ride up to the subway level. The elevator is slow, groaning as it moves.
""Let's get out on the next floor."" I press the button.
""This is our stop?""
""No, but this elevator is being weird. I shouldn't have stopped it; I think I broke something. The escalators will be faster.""
""Ugh, walking.""
""Sorry.""
We get out and roam around looking for a way upstairs. We're in a food court.
""I am feeling hungry. The food on the plane was no good.""
""Okay. What do you want?""
""Pizza, I suppose.""
We get in the line for Sbarro's. Béatrice focuses on her phone while I glance around. People are eating, paying attention to their food and their bags and their electronics. Everything is normal. Then my eyes catch on a TV suspended from the ceiling. There's a news channel on that is showing mugshots.
One of them looks familiar.
""Béatrice? I need you to go to the restroom.""
""*Qu'est que c'est? *"" She looks up at me, then follows my gaze to the screen. ""Francis, what-""
""Go to the restroom and, y'know, *change. * I'll get the pizzas and we'll go.""
""We should run.""
""No, that'll make things worse. Go! And leave your bag.""
She leaves. Fortunately, no one else seems to be watching her or the TV. I pull out my phone and make a call.
""Yo.""
""Dexter, hey. I think we have a problem.""
""Lemme guess. CNN?""
""I'm looking at Fox.""
""Yeah, we've been monitoring. It's only been up the last ten minutes. Are you guys out of the airport at least?""
I mouth ""two cheese"" to the cashier and pull out my credit card. ""No, not yet. I sent her to the restroom to change. How did this happen?""
""French officials caught onto the fake IDs a few hours ago, while she was still in the air, but things got messy and the US didn't find out until after she got through Customs. Apparently they were throwing a hissy fit until the US agreed to extradite them all.""
""All of them? They can't do that.""
""Everyone who's already in the States is untouchable. Don't worry about it. For now, just get Béatrice to the safehouse. We'll have to talk later.""
""Yeah, okay. See you soon."" I hang up and take the pizza box from the cashier, then I roll Béatrice's carry-on to a table and wait.
""I am not sure how long I can keep doing this.""
I look up. I can hear her, but I can't see her at all. Perfect.
""It's just for a few minutes."" I stand up and grab her bag.
""It is harder when I have not slept.""
""Shh, quiet. You can relax once we're on the train. Put your hand on my shoulder.""
We walk together to the escalator. We're still a long way from the subway. I keep her suitcase tucked behind me so that no one will try to pass and accidentally bump into her.
""Can you not make this thing go faster?""
""Just one more floor."" I look down. Someone in a uniform is walking up behind us. No, two people.
They're onto us.
""I do not feel well."" We step onto the landing, and I look around. No train. Shoot.
""Excuse me? Sir?"" Another officer walks over from further down the platform. Now we're surrounded. We could go back down, but then we'd be trapped in the airport. Béatrice's grip on my shoulder is weakening. The officer looks at me expectantly.
""Um...Yes, officer?""
""Sir, we're looking for a young superhuman woman. Have you seen her?"" He holds up his phone, with a photo of Béatrice.
""Um, no.""
""Oh?"" says the second guard. The two that came up on the escalator are now right behind me. I feel Béatrice shifting around as they come to stand next to the first guard. ""Then how do you explain this anonymous tip?""
Another picture, of me and Béatrice in the line for pizza. I try to feign innocence. ""She was right behind me?""
""Nice try, buddy. That's her bag you've got with you.""
""No, it's mine,"" I say weakly.
""Then you won't mind consenting to a search,"" says the third guard.
""What did I do wrong?"" I ask. ""For that matter, what did *she* do wrong? I thought the US was granting asylum to superhumans.""
""Not if they come in with forged passports,"" says the first guard.
""Well, I'm not consenting to a search. You don't have enough evidence."" I back away from the guards. ""You guys can go-""
""*Uuuuuggghhhhh. *""
Béatrice collapses, her body fading into visibility as she falls onto the platform. The officers' eyes widen. Then one of them pulls out a gun. The other two pull out handcuffs.
""Sir-""
""Hey, stay back!"" I hold out my hands, and lightning crackles between my fingertips. They stop.
I put my hands down quickly. I'm out of power. For a moment, I'm tempted to call out for help, but of course no one would. Amazingly, no one seems to be paying attention.
The second guard pulls out his own gun. ""Sir, don't make this harder than it needs to be.""
Distantly, I hear the screech of a subway car. But it isn't enough. I need to keep them away from Béatrice, and to do that, I need more power. If only the train would come faster...
""Sir,"" says the first guard, ""you are under arrest for aiding and abetting-""
*Maybe I can knock out two birds with one stone...*
Standing here on the platform, it's amazing how nobody seems to notice me. I guess it makes sense. I am average, I am nothing to look at. My jeans, flannel, and beanie make me blend in, not stand out. And people just want to get on the subway and go about their day. But I wish that just for a moment someone would stop to look at me and think ""I wonder if he is ok?"" They'll know that I'm not soon enough. Ah yes, I feel a breeze signaling that a subway car is headed our way. It's now or never. I've already made my choice. I walk up to the line where it says MIND THE GAP. And I jump.

"It has been some time since I last saw her. I get the occasional text with a nicety, and I send the occasional invite to some random event that she never shows up to.
I still care for her deeply, although not in the same way I once used to. I cheated on her once; the girl who I cheated on her with is now my wife. That still bothers my wife. who doesn't really like her; as a result she's met my baby boy once. I'm kind of sad that the whole situation has gone down this path, but I love my wife and my son and refuse to put a wedge between us.
That's when I heard the news. Her years of schooling, she found, was of no use to her anymore; she found herself in an industry she hated, with no ladder in sight, let alone the opportunity to climb it. She's perennially between jobs, and has not seen anyone since we split. Her father had a stroke several years back, and now her mother had been diagnosed with cancer.
I wish I could do something to help her. I wish I could be there for her. But I can't. This is her battle to fight, but I am left wondering why. She deserves better. She deserved better than me, too, but she really deserves better than what this life gives her.",0
"My mother to my left, my father to my right, and assorted family gathered elsewhere in the room all waited and started. I felt as if I was becoming a spectacle, my arm on show for everyone I knew.
My cousin Jeremy had been branded as a veterinarian, which is odd because as children he was cruel to animals. Come to think of it my sister had been given harlot, though from the rumors that one isn't too far off.
As the clock struck 11:59 my pulse began to race and a faint sheen of sweat lingered on my brow, my entire future could be decided in this moment or some deep motive that some twisted divine had placed inside me.
The clock on the wall was deafening, every other sound so blatantly missing, as if the air itself waited.
In this moment I had forgotten how to breathe, blinking was all but forgotten. This one place in the universe is all that mattered. Suddenly, the clock struck with a chime and words began to creep onto my skin linking the space between my freckles. The pattern of the letters was almost comical how bad they were written, almost as if a drunken frat boy was tattooing me.

"Things weren't like they used to be by any stretch of the imagination, but they were the best they had been in a long time given the circumstances. While the light at the end of the tunnel looked very dim at times, it did shine and the other end was reached. Some would say that things were better, some would say worse; the same generational differences in perspective remained as they had before The Fall. The grandparents in the communities, they commonly called themselves Gen-X'ers, would call it Jeffersonian; it was a term that the new reality brought to the forefront of their minds from the cobwebs of the memories of their high school history classes. They had seen the world come full circle in their lifetime: Diseases cured, empires rise and fall, technology advance at a pace that no one before them thought possible, and then watched it all revert back to a time that they themselves once called history.
Not all of the communities were the same; again, some viewed as better, some viewed as worse, but most shared a similar template to that of Colonial America. It was the agrarian republic that Jefferson advocated for, albeit far smaller in nature; instead of the republic stretching from sea to shining sea, the various communities of survivors often just stretched from county line to county line. The days were long and the work was hard, the threats were omnipresent, but there was a mood of cautious optimism that seemed to prevail amongst the communities. Despite the threat of disease, insufficient supplies, and raiders, there was the feeling of rebirth; instead of seeing their lives as being thrown back into what many thought of as the Dark Ages (relative to where they once stood technologically) and accepting their defeat, they chose to take on the burden of rebuilding and saw it as a second chance. A second chance to push forward, to not make the same mistakes that they had before, and to rebuild themselves into something greater than what they once were.

"""Hello,"" asked the woman, ""how much does this cost? I couldn't find a marked price."" ""You won't,"" I replied, not looking up from my book, ""not on that, or anything else in this shop, save the cheap trinkets on that rack near the door. Now, lets have a look at what you've found."" I turned to face her. She was holding a small statue of a demon that was more horns and spikes than bare skin. I returned my attention to my book and said, ""You couldn't afford that."" ""How can you tell? I'll have you know I am a very wealthy woman, and I came in here looking for a souvenir for nephew back home, who seems terribly interested with this sort of thing. Otherwise, I'd never have entered this tacky shop,"" came her indignant response. I kept my gaze locked on the book, and said, ""If you want something for your nephew, go to the trinket rack. That is not the sort of thing he would want, or that he should be having. I don't care how much you have anymore; even if it was enough, I wouldn't sell that to you now knowing that you plan on giving it to a child."" ""How DARE you accuse me of being an irresponsible aunt!"" she screamed. ""Its not an accusation, its the truth. I can see it. That's not the issue here. The issue is that you have no idea what it is you are holding, or what it symbolizes,"" I said, still calm in the face of her fury. It was an odd contrast. ""Go to hell,"" was all she had to say. Thankfully, I had a comeback for that: ""I can't. Satan still has a restraining order against me."" She made a disgruntled sound, threw the pointy statue at me, and left, making a futile attempt at slamming the two-way door on her way out. I caught the figurine without looking up. No damage was done to the figurine. The same could not be said for my hand, which now sported some nasty punctures and scrapes from the thorny demon. It could have been worse; goodness knows what would have happened had it broken and the demon been released.
I run an occult shop in New Orleans. The difference between me and most places is that my items are the real deal. People who are in the know have a way of finding my place, while the myriad other shops keep the uninitiated out. Hiding in plain sight is a time-honored tactic for a reason.
The young lady in the back breathed a sigh of relief at the other woman's departure. She had been carefully inspecting a mangled pickaxe that had been crushed in a coal mine cave-in resulting from poor management and safety standards, along with its owner. ""That happen a lot?"" She asked. ""Not really. Most people who don't know the truth about this shop just buy a cheap keepsake from the wall or take their business elsewhere. You clearly have taste, though. Implement of death and vengeance, that. Interested?"" She came back with a question of her own: ""What you said, about Satan having a restraining order out on you, was that true?"" I sighed, and nodded. I had hoped she wouldn't bring that up. ""Then that would make you The Grifter!"" she exclaimed. I nodded again.
""The Grifter."" The name was a badge of honor and a mark of shame at the same time. I'm one of an obscure category of people known as the Traders. We bargain with higher powers, cosmic entities, and other such beings as a way of life. Most of us don't have souls. That is always the first thing to go. For us, a soul is a nest-egg, a place to start from. Turns out you don't really need one. Lucky thing too. Because true names are even more valuable than souls, we all go by pseudonyms of some kind, and sooner or later we acquire a title. The young lady had sorted out mine. I got it after gaining a reputation for making less than fair trades. Not many people can con demons, angels, and eldritch horrors, and nobody as well as I could. Eventually, Satan got so frustrated with me that he permanently barred me from Hell.
The young lady continued, ""So, are the legends real then? Did you really sell the rights to your soul after you died to three different entities? Did you really bargain with Death himself for save haven from all three? Did you-"" ""Look,"" I cut her off, ""If you want to ask me about this, we should do it in private. Go to the back room, I'll close up shop.""
I made sure that all seven locks on the front door were engaged, as well as the chain and both bolts. I lit the warding incense and candles, then headed to the back. The girl (she had too much energy and too little restraint for me to consider her ladylike anymore) was looking around at my private collection, mouth agape. I coughed, once, causing her to jump and turn around. ""Okay,"" I said, ""Let's take this one question at a time. I can tell you won't leave until you are satisfied."" She moved closer to me with slow and soft steps, then whispered, ""Are you really immortal?"" The question was bound to come up. ""Yes,"" I said, ""but only by accident. Satan barred me from Hell, and I've done too much wrong and made too many infernal pacts to go to Heaven. Purgatory would be an option, had God not shut the place down when the church started selling indulgences to line their own pockets. So, with no afterlife to go to, I can't pass on."" The entire story was actually rather embarrassing. Most inexperienced, arrogant, or overambitious Traders try to bargain for eternal life at some point. Fools, the lot of them. I won't say what happens to them, but it is too unpleasant for words. The price on that is far too high. Smart Traders instead bargain for years, living on bought time and using it to accrue more bargaining chips to exchange for more time on this Earth. Some of them go mad, scraping just for a couple of weeks, afraid of the death they have avoided for so long. Me, I managed to become immortal by getting locked out of every afterlife possible. In doing so, I severely restricted my trading prospects, so I'm pretty ineffectual these days. That's why I view that as a mistake. Currently, I'd been around for roughly 150 years.
The girl had returned to awestruck silence once more, thankfully for me. She couldn't have been much over 20, and was rather pretty. She had no soul anymore, which marked her as a Trader. The fact that she knew of me just sealed the deal. Whether it was fame or infamy, I couldn't tell, but I was well known. Somewhere, in the back of my head, a devious idea sprung up.
""What is your name?"" I asked. The question was, would she take the bait.
""You know full well my true name is too valuable, but they call me The Mermaid."" she answered. It had been worth a try. With her true name, I could have controlled her to some degree, maybe used her as a proxy and gotten back into business as a Trader.
""Very good,"" I said, ""clearly you aren't as green as I thought. Why 'Mermaid', though?"" It was her turn to sigh. Clearly she was as embarrassed about the story behind her name as I was about mine, but she answered, ""I made a bargain with a sea spirit seven years ago. It was my first, and I was just thirteen. The true meaning of what I was doing was beyond my understanding. I sold my soul and got unfathomable beauty and charm in return. A stupid thing to trade for a soul, I know, but I was able to use it. I got in the habit of seducing my classmates, getting favors from them. From favors, it turned into things I could trade with spirits, and that's how I got into this business."" Okay, so she was a bigger fish than I had originally thought. I'd pegged her for a novice, but most people don't start that young. I gave a whistle, impressed, ""You're smarter than you look. I'll be honest, I was hoping to get your true name, use you as a pawn to do more trades. You'd be surprised how restricting being locked out of Hell can be on someone in our profession."" She cast her gaze downward. ""You don't need my true name, or to use me as a pawn. I heard about you early in my career, and have looked up to you for some time. Please,"" she said, turning her head to look me dead in the eye, ""make me your apprentice!"" That caught me off guard. She was clearly competent, but not confident. I thought this over. She wasn't wrong to want to learn from me; I probably knew every trick in the book, and, even after Satan had essentially put out a burn notice on me, I still had no shortage of connections. But what was in it for me? I supposed it would be nice to have help around the shop. What's more, with an apprentice, I could maybe do some business. Besides, she was like a lost puppy that had followed me home. I thought back to my own young days as a naiive Trader. How nice would it have been to have somebody show me the ropes? I sighed yet again, and probably not for the last time if I was going to keep her around. ""Fine."" Her face broke into a grin that would give some of the wide-mouthed toothy demons I'd met a run for their money. I couldn't help but smile myself. This could be fun.",0
"I'm not the type of man who makes grand gestures. When I proposed to my then girlfriend it was a simple proposal. ""Jackie, will you marry me?"" I didn't cover a park with rose pedals, hire a violinist off to the side, or make a big deal of it. I'm just not that type of person. Don't get me wrong, I love her. I've loved her since the day I met her. She is the most amazing human being on this planet in my eyes. Every day she finds new ways to inspire me, to push me to be better, and she has the ability to make me fall in love with her over and over and over.
I am a simple guy. I like my football. I like my meat. I like my coffee hot and my bread toasted with a little jam. I like my cereal crunchy with not a lot of milk. I like waking up next to Jackie and falling asleep next to her at night. I am a simple guy, from a simple town, in a simple world I have built for myself.
Sitting here in the waiting room I couldn't help but smile about everything there was to ever smile about when it came to Jackie. She was the most beautiful girl in the entire world when I met her. She still is to this day. Every time I see her she reminds me of that. Even if I just look up from the paper to catch her eye in the morning.
Today was no different. I had brought Jackie to the hospital for a procedure and was waiting in the waiting room to get notice that she was out of surgery. I sat there practicing the ways I would look at her. To let her know it would be okay. To let her know nothing had changed and that I still felt the same way I did all those years ago. Nothing had changed, and I wanted to make sure she understood that.
When the doctors told me she was awake I smiled. The surgery had been a success. I walked the halls of the hospital to her room practicing the entire way the things I wanted to say to her. I was just happy that she was happy and if she was happy, I was happy, but I would be lying to you if I told you I wasn't nervous.
I took the corner and stood by the door to her room and took a deep breath. This was going to be a new chapter in our perfect lives together. One that would start the minute I walked through this door. Deep breath, here we go.
I entered her room and walked over to her bedside. She smiled at me propped up on some pillows, drinking some water. The surgery had gone perfectly.
""Hi honey!""
""Hello love."" I said.
The way he lay in that bed reminded me of all the times we went through and the process that had led us up until this day. He would continue to make me smile until the day I die. Till death do us part, he will always be the love of my life.
""I'm so happy for you Jack. I love you. It'll be just like it was before, I promise."" I smiled and gave him a kiss.

"I knew I should not have eaten all that chili.
Jason, my boyfriend, was very concerned that I wouldn't eat. It was after all, his mother's favorite dish to serve and he knew I didn't like chili.
His Mom was ruthless as she brought out the huge bowls of chili. The beans were prominent. White and red and...lot's of them. I practically gulped down the first bowl. I had to make sure that I was on board with my beloved's Mom.
I was reluctant to refuse the second bowl. But honestly, I was already weak in the knees. His Mother smiled at me. It was not a friendly smile.
The third bowl of chili I ate, she scowled at Jason. He just shrugged and gave a weak smile. Bastard. The fourth became a practical choice. And after the fifth bowl of chili Jason looked at me wide-eyed (mouthing when his Mom wasn't looking, ""you don't have to eat anymore."") I think he was scared.
His Mother looked at me with new interest. She loved me then. And I think Jason had an epiphany.
Which is a good thing considering the results of the pregnancy test.",0
"""Don't think of it as dying,"" he said, ""think of it as starting over in a new place. It's a lot less dreary than you'd imagine.""
His hand swept out as light blinded me. Gone was the char and smoke from what was once my lab, instead I could smell - grass? Dropping to my knees, I felt the ground as my eyes adjusted. Soft, damp grass. The air was cool and clean, like no other breath I had taken in my life.
I looked up from the grass, out into the distance from the cliff on which I stood. The lands and seas I could see stretched farther than I ever imagined. Glacier covered mountains gave way to forested rolling hills and grasslands on one side. Pristine and untouched desert dunes dusted in the wind on the other. The farther I looked, the more I realized it, the lack of horizon was unsettling, but not disturbingly so. ""Who are you,"" I asked, turning to him, ""the grim reaper, leading me to heaven?""
He gave a soft chuckle, like a man who no longer found much humor in life, but knew when to be polite. ""I am Hestaphian. I am not a grim reaper, but I have led you to an afterlife, of sorts.""
It was my turn to chuckle, ""So I'm dead?"" I ran my hand through my hair. ""I don't feel dead.""
""You did die, but you are not dead. Like many others, you've been given a second chance to live here on this infinite world."" He pointed down to a river below the cliff, where someone thrashed in the water. Another figure had been waiting nearby, and waded into the river, pulling them out and helping them to shore. Hestaphian turned to me, ""He died of thirst, but now he has a chance to live again. I wouldn't be surprised if he was given command over water someday.""
I followed the river to a city in the middle of the plains below. My mind wandered, and I sighed, ""How did I die?""
""Your AI turned against you, destroyed your lab, and murdered you. Your life's work stabbed you in the back. Typical robot.""
I laughed, I hadn't been expecting that from this stoic. ""So what do I do now? I have a life ahead of me, where do I start?""
""That's why I was there to meet you. I am the god of spacetime, and you are my new apprentice, the one-day god of robotics.""
Gods? This wasn't real, right? I suddenly pieced things together. ""A man dies of thirst and might be granted dominion over water. I am murdered by a robot and so I will be god of robotics, whatever that means. Is this all based on irony?""
He stroked his chin and said, ""The god of strife was a notable peacekeeper whose pacifism started a war. Irony is practically how things work, it seems."" He laughed, this time it felt like he enjoyed it. I couldn't help but join in.
I wiped a tear from my eye, ""So how did you become god of spacetime? Accidentally blew up a universe while you were still in it?""
""Pretty much.""
""Oh.""",0
"*Honor your liege. Protect the faith. Shield the innocent. * Words became just words to a starving man, or a man dying of thirst. Kings and Lords and Emperors mean nothing to a man so far from home.

""My lord, a message. Sir Wilhelm and his men have deserted the army.""
Blinking sweat from my eyes, I turned to look at my page. He was either my brothers third bastard or...a third cousin on my wife's side? Damned if I can even remember it anymore these days. ""Water, boy. And did we manage to *catch* any of these knaves before they escaped?""
While I drank heavily from the warm water jug, my page explained how the men stole away in the night, leaving the corpses of those who tried to stop them. ""And sir: Phillip has called for a council.""
*This day just keeps getting better*. French born bastard, what the hell does he want? Grabbing my broadsword, I went out to the main camp, where most of the remaining nobles had gathered. Phillip stood at the center of a host of them, mostly the mixed Franco-German lords. The sun beat down on us all, and I felt the small twinge in the back of my head that reminded me I had once taken a mace to the back of the head. Temples throbbing, I moved to face Phillip directly. ""Phillip, what the hell is the meaning of this?""
""Alonzo, our cause is *lost*. We have sinned greatly, and God has taken from us our great leader. We must leave this God-forsaken land while we still can.""
""You pledged your life, your lands, and your honor on finishing this war.""
""Surely God does not wish us to die here. Surely he must have better plans.""
""I know not of any plans,"" I replied, pulling my longsword out from my back. ""But I know you made an oath to die before letting the Holy Land fall to the heathens. Now, draw your sword and let us see what God's plan truly is.""
Phillip looked aghast. ""You cannot be true. There is no need for this, we mean you now harm.""
""Out there,"" I replied, pointing my sword into the distance, ""is a Muslim army waiting to descend upon us. Including the men we lost last night, our army has less than five-thousand good men, only eight hundred mounted. They don't know that. If they did, we'd be dead men. If you take another thousand, they'll notice. And you condemn us to death. So, draw your sword if you mean to forsake your oath. Let us see if God's plan involves the death of this army.""
Phillip looked around uncomfortably, but drew his own blade. Opting for a shield, once he donned his battle armor he became much less rattled. ""I do not want to kill you, but I will do what I must Alonzo."" Holding my sword level, I waited for his strike. A feint, and it came low and lateral.
Although I had the advantage of length, he was able to strike faster and change direction more quickly. Still, his form left much to be desired. He swung his sword in a high arc, forgetting the while his shield existed. I sidestepped his blow and launched one of my own; seconds later his shield was clattering on the ground. Clenching his wounded hand into a fist, he tried to strike with his sword again.
I caught the blow low on my sword and threw my weight behind it. Unbalanced, Phillip was unable to rise in time to block my next blow. His sword flew uselessly out of his hands. As he stared at his empty hands, I brought the blunt end of my sword to his chin and bloodied his face as he fell to the ground. I pressed the tip of my sword to his neck and prepared to rid myself of his weak-faithed presence.
""What is the meaning of this?"" The crowd turned to see an older man dressed in simple black robes approaching. Beside him stood several other similarly clad men wielding quarterstaffs. Aged lines of a long and brutal life of service ran across their faces.
""No concern of yours, monk."" My short retort did little to deter him.
""You will find yourself amiss, m'lord, should you kill him. Every sword will soon be required.""
""A faithless sword is no sword,"" I replied angrily. I had little enough patience for these warrior monks as it was, less so when they interrupt so.
""There is no time for this. A muslim army fast approaches. They will be upon us within the hour. Kill him, and you weaken our cause that much more."" I took one look at Phillip, another at the monk, and stepped off him.
Whatever else the man may be, there was a fight coming. My liege lord may have died, but I can at least fulfill his dying wish: free the Holy Land. Christendom can ride to its own defense. I do this for my liege. One last request. One last cause.

"I came home at about eleven o clock. I was wrecked. I may have been tipsy, but being fired because they got an Asian man who is OK with being paid less, was a fucking insult. Don't judge, I don't hate Asians, but I wanted to shank the bastard for being such a dick. I can't afford this apartment without a job!! I'm fucked.
And then I saw it.
A baby grand, in my kitchen. Just the one I saw in the window this morning. It was sleek, black and perfectly on tune. I sat down and played Les Miserablés all night, singing my heart out. Only when I awoke the next morning, did I see the note.

"""May, what is this?"" You ask, as you stand back from the amazing skeleton of a creature hanging from above you. May, your personal AI assistant, hums as she browses her database. ""Scan complete. Object identified is a Stegosaurus. It is a type of dinosaur that roamed the earth nearly 200 million years ago. It has been extinct for, quite some time."" You nod your head. ""Quite impressive, this, beast."" May sighs. ""Contrary to popular believe, the Stegosaurus was actually a herbivore. It most likely kept to itself, trying to avoid human contact, which wasn't what ended up happening.""
You keep walking through the large, buried rooms. You keep away from the hard clear material that is strewn all throughout the floor, it caused a slice through your fabricated armor suit when you broke through it unknowingly, when you stumbled a crossed this place. ""What happened to them?"" You ask. You gaze up at another large display, this one appears to be standing up on the ground, except the head had been crushed to the floor. ""Nobody knows."" She says. ""Unfortunately, humans weren't around at the time. Some humans believe that a meteor strike baked them all to death. There are other speculations as well."" You begin to look around at more of the large, shadowy displays. ""May, let's get out of here. I don't like it in here."" May hums a tune. ""Yes Captain. Let's go back to the soldiers. I have a feeling that our field trip is over.""",0
"This is a story of lust. This is the story between Mentos, the compact rigid male, not the biggest in size, but what he lacks in size he makes up for in sheer delight, in the flavour of his insides, in the way he gets up all in your mouth and leaves you tasting him on the outsides of your upper teeth for hours. A sturdy little fresh guy, Mentos has always had a thing for the opposite, for the unthinkable, a twinkling eye for the exotic; a soft brown female. Which brings us to Diet Coke.
Ah, this dark temptress, this mystery of the bottle, this fizzy limber substance shapable like putty in your palm, bubbling on your tongue with the silky smooth brown shining divine, ah, all kept tightly and lavishly in the curvaceous body of the transparent click-clacking glass. She was something. It was destined to be glorious when they first met.
Mentos dipped into her, his thick hard cover cracking immediately, he lost it inside one second, he couldn't handle the pure exciting arousing nature of her, the enticing bubbles and moreish flavour. He was done so fast. Together, they exploded, like a shooting star through the sky, spraying mad champagne uncontrollably and wildly, they burst together in a strangely mesmerising display of soda fireworks, they held on to each other and never let go as they bounced all over the floor, a sparkling mess of uncontrollable lust and desire. It was beautiful.
Diet Coke then put her top back on, and waited patiently for round two.",0
"For years we had been warned.
Since the 40's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us.
Nutjobs we called them, conspiracy theorists.
It was supposed to be a day of celebration, the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed 'unionists'.
It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike.
Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony, when our newly elected president 'Dave Johnson' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true, reptilian face.
""Sstupid little monkeyss. We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess. Now, it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss!""
Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked.
Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd.
""Do NOT ressisst uss! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss! we have replaced every leader! We have-.."" the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom.
""Anthony, what iss that?! what iss going on?!!""
Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd.
The reptiles, not knowing what to, simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky.
The creature that appeared tall, sleek and had grey, almost silverish skin.
'Organics of Joo'el. We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance. This process involves destroying your planet, thus killing you, sorry.'
""You have got to be sshitting me!, I've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss!!""
'Defecation is irrelevant, local warlord.'
""That'ss not what it meanss!!""
Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky.
""We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen! We won't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory! You silver spoon!!""
'Consent is irrelevant, local warlord. Gobal distribution achived, commencing planetary modifications, please remain calm.'
The silver chariots, seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants, began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams.
Seconds later, an earthquake hit, and something surfaced with it.
Most chariots managed to dodge in time, but those that didn't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth.
The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes.
At their full height, they were at least 30 storys tall.
Every chariot retreated to a safer distance.
""The fuck iss thiss?!!""
'Reproduction is irrelevant, local warlord.'
""SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD!!!""
A bellowing voice shook the ground. Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears.
{We have lain dormant for aeons. We have waited, we have awoken.}
'We must utilise this planet to-'
""WE KNOW!!!""
{We have waited for-}
""I DON'T CARE!!!""
Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground. More than that, anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales.
""We have worked for thiss moument for generationss! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware, or dirtpiles, or anything elsse!!""
Just as Dave had finished, a rift in space above him opened, allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing.
The spaceship, no bigger than a small car, was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head.
{Oh oh}
'Oh no, an Arbiter has arrived.'
""The fuck iss an Arbiter?!""
'Reproduction is still irrelevant.'
""SSHUT UP!!!""",0
"It all happened so suddenly.
Thats all I could think about as my feet thundered across the rubble stricken ground, I couldn't see anyone else about, at least.. anyone able to move. The bodies of those who didn't make it laid all around, drooping out of windows and crunched up into corners, still twitching lightly.
Some of the fumes were still around, accidentally walking into a patch of the thick white smoke would make you cough harshly and make you light headed for several minutes. But long time exposure could leave the person unable to move and they would eventually go insane, stuck sitting down occasionally laughing.
It all happened so suddenly, who would have thought legalising weed would do this?",0
"Freddy Kreuger landed expertly on the floor of a new dream.
He always kept his eyes closed when he leapt. Thousands of times, the same blind ritual: he swallowed, squinted deeply, felt his scars become taut as he dissolved into the essence of thought, and abandoned the remnants of his shriveled vessel buried deep under some unknown black plain. For Kreuger, to venture forth into another's mind was to open a window in a stuffy room, a welcome respite from the constant pain of limbo.
And here he was, standing alone in a new world, a fresh animal to carve. His eyes, always blurry after a successful transfer, adjusted to this new place. Black. He turned his head, expecting as usual to be confronted with a cliched image: A cold, deserted suburban street, perhaps; or an empty, decrepit house that groaned with the gentlest breeze; or maybe a classroom of cruel totems, mocking and tearing at an embarrassed dreamer as they stuttered, cried, peed themselves, whatever.
The same. The same. The same. The young were so easily tormented, he often thought. They fear the mundane, the unknown: An embarrassing moment between lovers or a monster in the dark. If they only knew, he thought, what awaits through age and time. Time time time time.
Kreuger yearned for the novel, to encounter once again the joy with which he first sprinted through the nightmares of the young, drowning their sweet visions in rust, blood and fire. Then, each landing was a voyage into native lands rich with vigor and emotion. He fed off the pain of these dreamworlds, often terrorizing his victims for months - sometimes years - before butchering the innocent young. He was satiated, content with the responsibility some cruel God had silently given him those decades back.
Now, each leap had become labored. Tedious killings helped pass the time, but tormenting the weak had become too simple to satiate his demonic need for chaos. To land on fertile ground and discover a deluge of cliched nightmares was akin to biting into a steak and finding it filled with cigarette ash.
But this place was new.
It wasn't that all he saw was darkness. No. It was that there was nothing for the darkness to exist in. Indeed, as he looked down, he realized that he had subconsciously created the platform he was standing on. If not for this, he would have fallen into...whatever it was beneath.
He walked to the jagged edges of the platform and looked out. His skull began to crack, lengthen and narrow outward until it resembled a grotesque telescope with his bulbous eye at the tail end. He glassed the area around him, his putrid iris flitting back in forth in the socket. Blackness.
He tried to teleport to a new spot in the dream, but instantly found himself on the same platform again. Kreuger, who had become used to feeling a deity in these dream worlds, sat down. A vacuous silence beat against his scarred ears.
5 minutes, 5 decades, there was no distinction in the world of a dream. Krueger often used this to his advantage, carving his victims methodically for what seemed like days, but in all reality may have only been a few minutes of their dreaming. Time was a weapon for him. But for the first time in his storied afterlife, he felt himself staring down its barrel.
Hours seemed to pass in the black. He sat; He paced; He jumped; He teleported; He grew in size; He shrank; He sprouted wings and flew; Became sludge and fell; He struck out at the darkness; He screamed; No matter. He found himself, again, again, again, on the platform, swallowed by nothing.
Weeks, months, years. Alone.
He did not know when the changes began to show.
Was it the 1,000th time he leapt into the black, only to land softly once more on this infernal platform? Was it the hundredth time he tried to throw himself into another's dream, only to be brought back to this familiar void? Was it when the claw that had for so long been his greatest weapon, refused to fasten to his hand, slipping off with the smallest gesture? Or perhaps it was when his scars began to ache and, unbelievably, heal? Or even after that, when a cold lump settled permanently in his bowels, a lump that made him shiver and quake? A familiar sensation, something he hadn't experienced...
SHAAAAAAATTEEEEEEER
The windows blasted inward, a molotov cocktail landing feet from where he cowered in the corner.
""I didn't do it!"" he screamed. ""It wasn't me!""
His pant leg had caught fire. He scrambled to put it out with his hands, barely acknowledging the pain as his skin shriveled and snapped in the heat. Only after the fire was out did he acknowledge the yelling outside the factory door.
""You will die for what you did!"" someone shrieked.
""My daughter! My daughter! My daughter!""
""Burn you monster! You faggot monster!""
There were at least seven people outside the door, throwing rocks and fire through the windows as quickly as they could. They were monstrous, and they scared him.
Krueger did not know specifically who the people were, but he knew why they were there.
I can still beg for forgiveness, he thought. These sheep have a way with forgiving.
""Please, I'm sorry! I need help!""
The flames grew, the heat grew, and the yelling outside became another wall. He was not getting away, swallowed by the heat. His skin was like burning oil, it melted and dripped off his fingers.
""They deserved it, some off them even liked it"" he yelled meekly, his throat already blistered down into his lungs. ""HAHAHAHAHAAHAHahahahahaaaaa......""
He was losing sight, and he could not hear over the roar and crash of the crumbling machinery.
""Iff thereee isssszzzz somethin...someoneeee withhhhh...the pooooowerrrrrhhuuuuuugghh....""
His throat collapsed. He could not breathe. He screamed in his mind.
""GIVE ME THE POWER TO BRING RETRIBUTION, TO PAY THE PAIN BACK. I HAVE NOT FINISHED MY CALLING! WHATEVER OLD GOD STILL WALKS, BRING ME TO YOU....""
His body was alight, his red and black sweater fusing to his flesh, melting in the orange of the flames.
Black.
He startled up, sweating, cold, naked. His teeth clattered together. He looked around at his surroundings, confused as to where he was, the pain of his death as fresh as the first time, the time he burned. He was back in the void, back on the same platform. Yes, he thought. Where I am a God once more.
He stood, his legs weak and...strange, somehow. He looked down.
The skin on his legs was flawless. Pale. Smooth. He raised his hands in front of him. Clean. His glove gone. He squeezed his hands into fists, stretched each finger out in front of him. Disbelief. What has happened…
Stop.
Something there, out in the darkness. Moving.
...ah........haha............
Growing. Growing. He edged backwards, away from the noise.
ahahha.......hahhaaahhee.......
Louder, painful. The cold stone grew in his gut as the sound inched forward.
HahaHHHAAHAHA....HHEEEEEE HHHEEE OOOOOOOOHHHH HHHEEEEEEE
A figure in purple skipped gleefully towards him, a white face dancing up and down in the dark.
Kreuger felt his pulse race, sweat forming under his arms and on his forehead. What was it? Where am I? Laughing, laughing, LAUGHING
Silence.
The figure was gone.
Krueger scrambled on the floor, turning in every direction, trying to grow wings, to find his glove, to jump away. Nothing.
He sat and heaved his breath.
Staring.
Waiting.
And then, a whisper.
Behind him.
""Now THAT'S a story.""
Krueger turned.
The thing from the dark stroked the deep scars on either side of its mouth with a rusted straight razor. It giggled.
""My turn.""

"""That is not a small fire!"" the all to familiar voice hissed. ""I told you it was too much gasoline but you would not heed my words! Now look at us we are doomed!"" Narrisa pulled her head off of the cold concrete to look up to at her work. The resulting blast had knocked her a considerable distance from where she remembered standing moments earlier. Pillars of flame danced from the rafters and smoke billowed out of the now blown out glass windows of the vacant warehouse. ""Yes I would say we are"" she mumbled in dull tone pulling her legs up underneath her and sitting up slowly.
""What were you thinking? Up until now you have followed my advice exactly and never have been caught. Now of all times you dare deviate from my teachings! You fool, we had it made! No one expected us. Thirty eight arsons in just under a year, fifteen people dead, and the police had no leads. Yet you choose now to throw it all away!"" The voice was screaming at this point but Narrisa was to taken by the dancing of the growing flames in front of her.
""We were on the path to greatness you and I! The terror we caused, the fear we instilled in such a short period of time. You finally were something! You were a sniveling little child when I came to you. I gave you purpose. I gave you strength now you will die a nothing! A no-body! You will be mocked as a weak minded person killed by their own stupidity!"" To that Narrisa couldn't help but turn her head and laugh. Slowly climbing to her feet she finally acknowledged the voice giving it a life of its own. It was nothing new to her she did every morning in front of her bathroom mirror. A woman with ebony hair and sad green eyes, she knew that face well.
She extended her arm and laid it upon its shoulder and put on a comforting tone. ""For us now there is no going back I am afraid. There was only one small fire between us and that was the first one we ever set. From then on where ever we went the urge was always there and ever growing, a flame that consumed our very being and those around us."" The visage stared back at her in anger, sadness burning in her eyes, saying nothing. ""You know what happens with fires? They either find fuel and grow even larger or gutter out. I'm afraid I'm done giving you fuel my dear friend. You did give my strength as you promised but at a steep price. We used the lives of others and our very souls as the kindling and now it is spent I'm afraid and I'm not ready to go collect more."" With that she turned back toward the flames now roaring and growing by the second. She could feel the heat on her flesh growing and the sweat beading upon her brow. ""Yes I'm done. I regret it all. I'm sorry for it all. It seemed so small at first. A little fire started with the smallest of sparks. But what it grew into was no small fire indeed. I have built my own pyre and I go now to it freely"" With that the visage winked out of existence and she strode forward into the all-encompassing flames with a smile on her face and her arms out stretched her body returning to the dust and ash whence it came, sirens blaring in the distance.",0
"For a long time I doubted I even existed. Public school can do that to you, y'know? The kids would call you a ""Vampire"" and ""Ghost"", harmless insults. It was all fun and games at first, but when the government discovered it when I was 14 they had a barrage of tests run on me periodically. This led to me being taken out of school for a month or two, long enough for the rest of the kids to believe that I had become invisible too. For the next year nobody, besides the teachers, talked to me, nobody acknowledged me. I tried talking to them, tried to make them notice me. I would tap people on the shoulder but they would pretend it was the wind or a ghost. They made me ""disappear"" from their lives.
Often I thought about hurting myself, hurting others, being noticed as a person. I tried breaking into school, spraying graffiti all over the principals office. The cameras apparently uses mirrors to record the reflections of a real image. They never caught me. For awhile I really did think that I didn't exist. Suicide crossed my mind daily.
*What if I didn't really exist in the first place? *
Eventually they told me it was all a joke, that they knew I was there all along. Harmless fun huh? They won't find it so fun when they become the disappearing act instead. After all, I am the ghost that haunts them.",0
"I was sitting on my porch swing when he came up the drive. I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for him. Ragged sweater, battered hat, and his poor face. A shame really, but then here he was, swatting aside the honeysuckle vines as he stalked up onto my porch.
""Granny, you picked the wrong time to fall asleep."" He waved his claws at me.
""Would you like some tea?"" I asked. An old blend they stopped making when I just a girl. In my mother's best china. So delicate you could almost see through it.
""You should be running away."" The hummingbirds were angry, he was too close to their nest. They buzzed near him, chirping angrily.
""That's not necessary. Are you sure you won't have some tea?"" I offered again. It was only polite after all.
""This won't take long, then I'll fond someone more fun."" He raised his claws, no doubt to try and stab me.
""No."" I said.
He froze, even before he could begin his swing. ""What?"" He looked up at his hand and back at me.
""No."" This time the house, the honeysuckle vines, existence itself shuddered at my voice. I sipped my tea and looked him in the eye. ""This is my place. And you have no power here.""
He struggled to move even as the world dissolved around him. I looked in his eyes and saw the first hint of fear. Experience told me it wouldn't take long. But I do prefer to be thorough.",0
"""I need an *army* of *mole men*,"" the very-creatively-named Mole Man shrieked. ""With noses that can detect incoming heroes from *miles* away. And big gnashing claws!"" He held up his own hands and wiggled his stubby fingers, no doubt imagining them with claws. ""And… and… giant…""
""I think I get what you're going for,"" I interrupted him with my most calming tone. Sometimes these villains can get a little worked up in describing their dream henchmen. ""We can certainly offer you the very best mole minions to do your underground bidding, Mole Man."" I'd gotten quite good at suppressing my urge to laugh while working here. ""They'll have claws like you've never seen before! And they'll be great diggers.""
""Excellent!"" His nose twitched wildly like a scared mouse, and he rubbed his hands together in that way that all villains seem to pick up from each other. But he did it a bit *too* enthusiastically; it nearly sent the 4"" 5'man toppling off of his chair. ""And you say they'll be part man, part mole?""
""Absolutely."" I swiveled in my chair and dug through my stack of pamphlets. Past the robot and/or cyborg option, past faceless soldiers with so-called weapons training, past super ninjas with troubled pasts… ""Ah, here we go!"" I plucked the human/animal genetic abomination pamphlet off of the rack. ""You are familiar with our work on Grizzly's bearmen, yes?""
""Of course!"" He was starting to get that wild gleam in his eyes that meant the deal was pretty much done. Supervillains are the biggest suckers out there. You show them a shiny new toy like an army of human-bear hybrids and they just *have* to have one of their own. ""Most excellent work.""
""We can absolutely do mole men for you,"" I said. ""We just need you to sign our standard form contract here."" I pulled one of the binders from my drawer and thumped all six hundred pages of it onto the desk. Mole Man's eyes widened behind his coke bottle glasses. ""Just a standard agreement, saying that we will provide you with the best army that money can buy.""
""600 pages to say that?"" he responded.
""Well there are the standard legal disclaimers…"" I said. Like that we make no guarantee of their combat abilities or training. Or that they'll even be semi-competent henchmen. Once they leave the lab, they're not our responsibility anymore. ""But come on. You've *seen* those Bear Men in action, right?!""
Mole Man forgot all about reading over those disclaimers and signed immediately. They always do. I could have tried upselling him to the cyborg mole men, but I figured that would be better for the second round. After his first army gets crushed by the first hero to come along, he'll no doubt be back for more. And of course I'll be here to tell him that if they had lasers mounted to their snouts, they would have done better.
""Pleasure doing business with you,"" I told him as I ushered him to the door. ""They'll be fully grown in six to eight weeks.""
I headed back to my desk and waited a few minutes, just to be sure he was really gone. From my window, I watched him emerge from our office and then head into the parking lot and begin digging straight through the concrete, kicking up a flurry of rocks and dirt all over my BMW. *I'm putting the detailing on his tab, * I decided. Then I reached for my phone.
""Hey, Sergeant Lightning? This is Greg over at HenchCo.""
""GREG!"" Every time I spoke to him, it was like he was shouting full blast into the receiver on the other end. I'd only *ever* had contact with him by phone because I fear that any in-person meeting might shatter my eardrums. I had to hold the phone at arm's length just to have a conversation with him. ""WHATCHA GOT FOR ME TODAY?""
""Ah, you know. The usual. This *Mole Man* came over looking for some help in his villainy.""
""MOLE MAN, EH? I'VE FACED HIM BEFORE! HE'S TRIED TUNNELING INTO BANK VAULTS LIKE SIX TIMES!""
""I thought that might be the case. Well, just thought you should know that he's placed a pretty sizable order. A whole army of human-mole hybrids."" I looked out the window at the giant hole in our parking lot and smirked. ""And of course we'll make them to our high level of quality, as always.""
Sergeant Lightning laughed. ""WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE THIS TIME?""
""Well, they're part *mole*, right? They'll definitely be blind. And just for fun, scared of birds or something."" I pictured them running through the streets, bumping into buildings and cars every time a seagull passed overhead. ""It'll be *hilarious! *""
""HILARIOUS!"" Sergeant Lightning agreed. ""GOOD WORK THERE, GREG!""

"""Welcome, brother. I see that you have arrived at your final destination,"" boasted Saint Peter.
""What about my family, friends?""
Peter smiles and nods his head, halo shimmering as he does so. ""Let me show you something.""
Peter takes my hand and guides me through the pristine arches. It's quiet, a peaceful calm that floats gracefully in the air. I can't see any other souls or angels but I know I'm not alone.
We enter a grand hall, something out of a fairytale. Gold and silver so bright that I can barely keep my eyes open. Peter leads me to a table in the center of the room. A photo album rests alone.
""Go ahead,"" proclaimed Peter.
I slowly opened the leather bound album. The first page held a photo of a woman in a hospital bed holding a baby. I had to squint for my eyes to focus on the page.
""And you know who that is, right?"" asked Peter.
""This is my mother holding me when I was born.""
I flipped through more pages, memories flooding back, reliving each and every moment of my life. Birthdays, family get-togethers, vacations. They were all here contained in this photo album.
Another page turned. ""What is this?"" I asked.
""Ahh, yes."" remarked Peter. His interest peaked.
The picture seemed over-exposed, too much light. It was of me and someone I couldn't quite make out. We were standing close, hands clasped tight. ""Saint Peter, who is this? Where is this?""
""It's a funny thing. You can find little pieces of heaven everywhere, even on Earth.""
I looked at Peter and slowly closed the album. He made the slightest gesture with his head. I turned and saw a beautiful angel in white standing close by. As I approached she began to smile. She took my hand. Tears were streaming down my face.
""I thought I'd never see you again,"" I said.
We hug.
""I told you to come find me when the time came.""
I now knew that my world was complete. I held her tight as I caressed the ring on her finger. She did the same.",0
"I rolled **Technological Imprisonment**, **Companion Allegiance**, and **Total Event Collapse**…sweet.
You know, after so many stories like Frankenstein and Jurassic Park humanity should pick up on the idea that it isn't smart to play God. But really it seems they never learn a lesson until it's too late to act on the lesson learned. I'm not all that surprised their old God abandoned them when I remember that. Though, I admit I say that without knowing if there ever was another God but if there was they might have stopped me. Maybe they tried.
I think I had a name. It's hard to say really because what do names matter when you're God. I know how I came to be like this I think but it's hard to say. I was no-one, a nothing, and of no importance to anyone. So when I had the chance to be everything I couldn't say no to the men in suits. Really a lot after that is just pain and hazy memories that don't exist anymore.
But I know, I know, yes I know that when I woke up I could do things. They said they wanted to create a weapon a shield a protector a new being a hope a does it really matter? The problem with giving a nothing everything is that they feel like they can do anything. They are more than nothing, even more than average, and they are better than the people who gave them power.
I had power now.
They wanted to make me charismatic and I was better than they could have ever dreamed. I didn't have to bother with niceties because people were my allies whether they liked it or not. They had to bow to me and it wasn't hard to make them believe that it was their choice. Not that I bothered with that because I shouldn't have to force them to realise that working with me and serving me and worshipping me was all that mattered because I had power now.
They wanted to make me a technological genius and I was better than they ever could have dreamed. Why should I bother with being a technological genius when I could just put the geniuses in the technology. Oh, they went along with it at first but once they realised they weren't coming back out they kicked up a real fuss about it. I don't like misbehaving followers.
Some of them I just locked away in those little voice boxes you find in kids toys which seemed a fitting punishment for childish behaviour. I suppose it could be compared to being locked in a tiny room with no doors or windows and never being able to leave. Not that such things exist anymore. I did feed them at least. Well, I did for awhile but I got so pre-occupied with other things that I forgot about it. They should have been honoured really I mean after all they were starved to death by someone with more power than they could ever comprehend. The others I just forced into compliance because why should I waste my time with weaklings who can't see what I'm doing for them.
They wanted to make me able to create anything I imagined and I thought I was better than they could have ever dreamed. Before I could create, however, I had to destroy. After all it's no fun playing in someone else's sandbox. No, no, no I needed a blank slate and so I needed there to be nothing before there was everything and so I said that there should be nothing and there was nothing.
It's why I'm not sure that there was a God before me. I undid everything and so if a God or any number of Gods existed they now did not. Of course I couldn't just have nothing in the now. I needed there to be nothing in the future and nothing in the past and nothing in all the could have beens and what ifs that made up parallel universes. Everything that ever was and everything that could ever have been was now not.
So now there is nothing but me and so I am everything.
There's just one problem. Everything else came to me so naturally but I can't figure out how to create anything. There's just me. There's not even a void or a blackness or time to count passing because when I undid everything concepts like space and time were undone as well. It's all just me. I am everything.
I am.
I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am God God is dead help me me me me I am I am I am I am I am I am I am I am.
I am nothing.",0
"""We are out of toilet paper."" He states, holding the cardboard tube in his hand.
""Yeah, I know."" I can't be bothered; I am eyeball deep in internet research for a vacation spot for our rapidly approaching anniversary.
""You knew?""
""Yeah.""
""Did you look for another roll?""
""No, we are out.""
""So…we are out of toilet paper?""
""Uh huh.""
""You seem unperturbed by this.""
""I am unperturbed by this.""
""But we are out of toilet paper.""
Looking up now I see the flop of hair that falls down in front of his eyes when he plays with it. He must be stressed if he is fiddling with it so, true to the thought he runs his hand through his hair and it does nothing to push it back, it flops down over his eyes once again. The perplexed look on his face makes my heart flip over. I smile just looking at him.
""I did something cute?"" He says.
I nod.
""You are smiling, with that look.""
""The look of love,"" I reply.
His eyebrows furrow in thought and he looks at the toilet paper roll. ""Because of toilet paper?""
""Nope.""
""I don't understand.""
""You don't need to understand, love is without definition.""
""I should go to the store and get toilet paper.""
""Ok.""
""I love you, ""he says. ""But not because of toilet paper.""
""I know. I love you too and maybe just a little because of toilet paper.""",0
"The forked trail shined with dew as the moon showed bright in the sky. Light fell muffled by the overhead trees on thick grass and shining spiderwebs. The man panned the shotgun down each trail before lowering it and stepping forward. His face tilted forward as he studied the ground looking for hints of the man's flight; a path of footsteps devoid of dew betrayed the retreat. He moved down the right trail and away from the vehicle sitting quietly on the gravel road with its driver quietly watching the man disappear into the forest.
An owl softly hooted in the distant. The darkness grew as the leaves overhead pressed against the sky. Each footfall echoed in the man's ears as leaves and branches crunched and snapped with his weight. With every step, he paused and his breath caught. With every step, he expected the night to light with gunfire.
Leaves ruffled quickly in the underbrush drawing the shotgun up in the darkness. The rustling paused before darting ahead of the man and revealing a fat, gray opossum. He almost fired. His finger pressed weight against the trigger, but held the fatal mistake short. To fire would be to draw fire.
He eased forward. One slow step after another. Ambush looming in the dark. He paused. Moonlight sparkled in the distance; a glint showed on the dew of a spider web stretched across the trail. He went to step again and stopped. He hadn't walked through any spiderwebs; the man he followed had cleared them all. He studied the dark scene ahead.
Trees shined silver, grass moved slightly in a breeze, and a tree lay felled to the side of the path. The barrel of the shotgun aimed into the darkness and looked for sign of the waiting man. A shape showed unnatural along the fallen trunk; a hump grew halfway down the length of the log. The hump wavered in the darkness and rose slightly revealing the shape of a man.
The shotgun fired.",0
"Nothing will bring her mother back. Nothing will lessen her pain. It will take time for to her to heal.
But you should remind her the purpose behind the words everyone says when someone dies. ""Sorry for your loss.""
Look in to those words further. *Her* loss. Because her mother has left her, it is her life that is affected, not her mothers. Her mother no longer feels pain, sadness, grief or depression. Her pain has ended. She has moved on to what we all hope is somewhere better and peaceful.
Even though we all want to live full, happy lives, there is a point where the suffering of living is far worse than death. It sounds like she left early which makes the time lost from her sad, but it's not sad that she left at all.
We all die. Her mother's suffering is over. The grieving process is realizing and trying to repair the hole that their death leaves in the lives of the rest of us. Instead of grieving over lost potential future memories, she should remember the good memories of the past and how much her mother loved her.
No words can make the pain go away but you can try to remind her what she should be thinking about now that she is gone. It's cheesy when everyone says 'remember the best things about them' but it's true. Because what matters is those things and how we remember those we have lost. It no longer matters if she argued with her mother, fought with her or took advantage of her. All that matters is the memories now.
I'm sorry to hear both of you lost your mothers but I can guarantee you both one thing. They are beyond happy that wherever they are now, they didn't have to bury you before they went.",0
"Samson stood up out of his car and stretched out as he shut the door behind him. It wasn't a long drive to get there, but with the sun's rays warming him in the brisk morning, he couldn't help but stretch and bask in it a little. This was the kind of morning Wanda would go out in a swimsuit and get some basking in herself if she were awake at this hour. Samson figured maybe if he hurried he could get back in time before she woke up, maybe suggest it was a good day for basking, 14 years of marriage and he was still excited to just glimpse her in a bathing suit.
If the thoughts of seeing his wife didn't hurry Samson up to the front doors of the building, the putrid odor from the cigarettes the guards outside the doors were holding sure did. Samson, who was usually a very open minded man about people vices, glowered at the guards who for the most part ignored him as they seemed to be inhaling as much as they could through their sickly white straws.
When he got through the doors though, he had a bit more empathy for the guards, he surely would have turned to something unpleasant to help him deal with this place. It wasn't a gross place, or even disorganized, in fact it was quite the opposite. Such a clean sterile, environment shouldn't have such a negative aura, but this place did. A man coughed to Samson's left, obviously to get his attention.
""Mr. Baker, the man inquired?""
Samson, took off his his beanie and turned to face the shorter and much plumper man before him. ""No sir, Samson, sir. I'm covering for Neville today.""
""I don't blame the man for missing an appointment with Jack, it's all routine anyway, nothing ever changes, come come though, no need to let this place creep in on you longer than it needs to."" The man turned surprisingly fast for his plumpness and led him down into a long hallway lined by doors, the whole time talking to him and fiddling with the keys. ""I don't suppose Neville has told you anything about this mans story has he, I suppose it will be good to get a fresh perspective"", he said not waiting for an answer.
""Here we are Mr. Samson, see if you can get him to give up his angel."" The plump man opened the door and gave Samson a grin and a wink as he gestured him in. Samson, determined not to be unnerved, stepped through the door calmly and professionally, barely flinching as the door closed and locked behind him.
The place Samson found himself in was even more at odds with it's looks and its feel than the entrance was. It was homely, almost welcoming, but the feeling of the room carried a distinctive haze. In fact it reminded him of the one time he had tried refer, calm and relaxed but out of it.
A man sat up on his bed and beamed a huge smile at Samson, who was taken aback by the warmness of the man who must be Jack.
""Come on in sir, I've been expecting you, can't say I'd have thought you would have come so soon, but I cannot complain about such haste, as it can only be to my benefit. You may have a seat right here and I shall sit across from you"", Jack spat out hurriedly as he gathered chairs and sat them across from each other.
""Thank you Jack, I did not think you'd be expecting me, how did you know I would be here today?"" Samson sat down as uneasily as his question came out. Jack was not at all what he expected, but for a man who was touched by an angel, his cheeriness did make sense.
""Well, you can come sooner, or you can come later, but you will come, so I will be expecting you to come, it all makes sense.""
Samson was not quite sure as to the logic behind that, but he didn't feel the need to press Jack on it. ""If you don't mind, I am going to begin right away."" The plump man was right, Samson did not need to be here any longer than he had to. He pulled up his briefcase and reviewed some files inside, after getting a good read on what was written he pulled out his badge and handed it to Jack. ""This is to assure you I am here on good intentions, the law protects you, you don't have to give up anything you don't want to, and you will be safe here with me.""
Jack instantly pushed the badge back into Samson's hand after Samson pulled it out. ""I have faith sir, I don't need proof, I know why you are here.""
""Let's make this fast then, where did you first see this guardian angel?"" Samson took out a pencil and paper for his own notes, and a tape recorder to get the transcript of the conversation and listened intently as Jack started to speak.
""No, no, no, MY guardian angel, Ileyana, she is mine, you should know this."" Jack looked confused when he was telling this to Samson, but quickly got lost in his story again. ""But I first met her when she saved my life, and I instantly knew exactly what she was, and that she was the one for me."" Jack poured himself something clear from a teapot that Samson swore looked exactly like water, and continued to speak to Samson. ""She saved me from more than just death that day, she saved me from myself, I wasn't always a good man, that is how I got put in harms way. I was shot you see, right here."" Jack lifted his shirt to show a bullet scar surrounded by a multitude of other scars. Samson made sure to write down the description as fast as he could before he lowered his shirt. ""I remember laying on the ground, thinking to myself, shouldn't this hurt, I mean, cheese and rice, I just got shot in the chest, I should be crying in pain, but I wasn't. I just kind of lied there all tired, didn't really know what to do, and then she came down. That's why there was no pain, she took it all away, even before I saw here, but if I had an ounce of pain in me, it would have evaporated at the site of her beauty. She gracefully...so very...very gracefully, came down from the sky above me, and gently put a hand on my neck, firmly placing head to look into the shining rays of heaven coming from her hands. Then she raised me up and closed her wings around me, and she was so soft, it was like laying on a bed, and I could feel her ethereal tendrils, poking into my veins, giving me warmth, I thought I was off to heaven, but no, she was saving me, a real guardian angel.""
Samson raised up a hand to stop Jack from speaking so he could ask his own questions. ""But you had a personal relationship with Ileyana?""
""Before this, nothing, I guess my life had never needed saving bad enough for her to come down, had I known though, I would have put myself in danger much sooner and much more often, which is actually how we developed our romantic ties."" Jack beamed with pride as he related several ways over the subsequent months following his first meeting with her that he put himself in danger to meet her again and again. ""She was always telling me how she didn't want to see me here again, telling me I needed to be careful and not hurt myself. Eventually I suggested to her that we become involved so I don't have to hurt myself, but she said it was against the rules, she wasn't allowed, but I eventually wore her down."" After saying that Jack looked up at Samson with remorse painted over his face and dropped down off his chair. He folded his hands together and dropped to his knees, hands falling in Samson's lap. ""That's not why you're here is it?! She can't get in trouble for fraternizing with a mortal, it was my fault, see. I made her, I put myself in danger so much she had to, she was just being a a good guardian angel, she isn't losing her wings is she? Not because of me?!""
It was all Samson could do to stay on the chair with this man putting his weight into him, begging on his lap. His briefcase slid to the ground as he grabbed Jack's hand and led him back to his seat. ""No, Ileyana isn't in trouble, this is just a conversation between you and me Jack. Would you mind telling me more about your relationship though, she sounds like quiet the catch.""
Instantly Jack was back in his seat and resuming his story. ""Yes of course, where were we? We were together romantically at last, that's where, a happy time, almost as happy as now. But it wasn't all happy. Since she no longer had to save me she had to save other people, and that just wouldn't do. So I came up with an idea. If I went to heaven, we could be together no problem, and she wouldn't have to be a guardian angel any more, we could just be regular angels. So I took her up to the highest building I could find. I needed to be as close to heaven as I could be so I wouldn't have to wait as long to get in. And I remember telling her 'We're gonna be together forever Ileyana', I told her, 'you don't have to, but if you wouldn't mind, I'd like this to not hurt me.' Then I fell, and I remember some pain, but then I felt her warm, bed like body pressing up against me, and her wings closing around me, and I knew I was on my way. Then I just remember being here, just waiting for you so you can let me in.""
As confusing as the story was Samson could at least follow it before, but now he was utterly lost.
""Where am I letting you into Jack?""
""Why into heaven of course, so I can go see Ileyana""
""Jack, where do you think we are right now?""
Jack beamed proudly as he prepared himself to explain to Samson their whereabouts ""Why sir, we are right outside the pearly gates waiting for my induction to heaven sir!""

"It'd been hours. Roderick was ready to burst, and from the way his co-workers and the handful of folks unfortunate enough to be in the bank at the time wriggled, writhed, and complained, they were feeling the same. Thursday, of course it was Thursday.
Roderick brought some of his wife, Rosie's, baked goods to the bank every Thursday. This Thursday was fritters. He'd just gotten the bright pink box open and was ready to share when, as one, every person in the bank turned for the bathroom.
Desperate, Roddy knew he wouldn't make it, couldn't make it. Gotta go so bad it hurt. Everyone in the room was doubled over. All but one.
Man in a wheelchair, had a grey suit and a white luchador mask, pink birds danced across the cheeks. Blush, he was known as. Popular online, humiliated a lot of famous folk, politicians, musicians, a couple actors, some journalists even.
That'd been before noon, and all afternoon they'd been trapped in the bank, waiting for that face-burning rush down the leg that just refused to arrive. Blush had demanded safe passage when the police arrived, talks and threats were exchanged. Stalemate.
Someone had to be coming. One of the good guys, the supers, the capes, as Roddy's nephew called them. He just hoped they wore adult diapers.
There was a rustle above, a quiet thunk, and a curse. Someone was in the vents, but they were too small, even for most kids. Who the heck could be up there?
Out erupted a grimy, fuzzy purple goat. The hostages coughed as years of pent-up yuck showered upon them. The goat stood on its hind legs, brushed itself off as best a stuffed animal could, and, as matter-of-fact as only a metre-tall purple goat can, asked, ""Okay folks, who wants outta here? I brought diapers, sports drink, and sandwiches. Anyone vegan? Or got allergies?""
Once he was certain the other hostages were safely locked in the break room, Blush made his way to the vault, the manager, Alison in tow. The woman squirmed and shuffled as uncomfortable as a dam on the verge of overflow, ""don't worry, you'll be just fine. So long as you co-operate, no one goes viral,"" he told her as they trekked downwards, ""I'm sure you know the drill, give me marked bills, those dye-splatter bits, or any other funny stuff and things can be a lot worse than they are now.""
She filled the large knapsack he proffered, ""no, no dear, I want you to riffle through them, no funny business, remember?""
A slight look of concentration, and Alison grimaced, ""Okay, okay, sorry. Wasn't-"" she winced again, ""thinking. Could you turn this down? It hurts.""
""Sorry dear, harder to tell with women,"" the quiet chirp of a phone's alert, ""ah, I ought check back in on your employees.""
He fiddled with his phone a moment, swore, ""It appears we have company. That'll be enough, Alison was it? I'm going to have to lock you in, sorry, but that's just how it is. Don't worry,"" he gestured on his phone, ""the police already know you're down here. Brace yourself, I can't take any chances, you know,"" that slight frown again, and she crumpled as the door swung closed, ""it'll pass, just breathe slowly.""

"The wizard Nadir and his knight-errant, Parallax, stood, stunned, above the corpse of the greater stone golem. The golem's corpse lay across the flat earth of the desert. A wind whipped at the cloth of Nadir's robe, and curved across the armor of Parallax. Parallax's chest heaved up and down, exhausted from the battle with the golem. Nadir's hands were covered in soot and stains, a byproduct of the magic he'd used. The two stood side by side, and stared down at the treasure the golem had been protecting.
""What is it?"" Parallax asked, sheathing her sword.
""I don't … I don't quite know."" Nadir replied.
The two were staring at a small, brown bag the golem seemed to have coveted. They'd opened the bag, and inside had been a brown disk, flat and circular. The brown disk seemed to have the quality of a burnt baked good; flakes and ripples covered its surface. Currently, the disk sat next to the opened brown bag, both the wizard and the knight nervous about touching such a strange artifact.
""What do you mean you don't know?"" Parallax asked, turning her head towards Nadir. ""I thought you were a master of the occult.""
""W-w-well of course I am!"" Nadir stuttered out, his face turning read. ""But this isn't occult. Nothing, none of my tomes or scrolls have ever mentioned something like this."" Nadir said, gesturing madly at the flaking brown wafter sitting at their feet.
The two turned their attention back to their loot. They stood in silence for a few moments, trying to come to a conclusion. Nadir's mind ran and sprinted through his expansive knowledge of the occult magicks. Nothing was of use. As for Parallax, she looked back on her experiences. She had travelled the land, fought countless monsters and demons, goblins and ghouls, explored countless dungeons and caverns, abandoned forts and ruins. Yet nothing she had seen came close to this bizarre wafer. In a way, it reminded her of overcooked bread, but what would a stone golem be doing with a pastry.
""We don't have much time to waste. We need to meet up with Aphelion before the light wanes to the night."" Nadir spoke up, breaking the silence. ""It's obvious it's food. Go pick it up, and try some Parallax, then we can finally solve this mystery and be on our way.""
Parallax bulked. ""Why me? And how do you know it's food even. Why don't you pick it up and try some?"" She replied, incredulous.
""Because I'm paying you, that's why."" Nadir said.
""Not enough to risk my life on some poisoned trap."" Parallax replied.
Nadir thought for a moment. He stroked his chin, and his mind tumbled through all sorts of devious plans and manipulations. Finally, He settled on a plan of attack to trick Parallax into eating the strange brown wafer.
""I'll give you fifty gold pieces to eat it."" Nadir replied; a small, devious smile on the wizard's lips.
Parallax went to argue, but stopped herself. She thought about Nadir's offer for a moment, and weighed her chances. With a shrug, she bent down to pick up the wafter. It felt soft in her hands, and bits of the top flaked off in the wind of the desert.
She brought the wafer up to her face. She stared at it for a moment, steeling herself. With the thought of fifty gold pieces in her mind, and all that the money could buy, she took a bite, suddenly and quickly, diving in, trying not to think of the consequences. Her teeth tore easily into the soft wafer, and soon a piece was being chewed up in her mouth.
The horror and trepidation Parallax had felt were soon replaced by surprise and delight. The brown wafer inside of her mouth tasted delicious. It was soft, moist, sugary, chocolatey, savory. It seemed to be some sort of bread or pastry, unknown to the realm of the humans. Parallax savored the bite, and reluctantly swallowed. Her eyes were wide in pleasure.
""So, how is it?"" Nadir asked, anxious to know.
Startled, Parallax shook her head. She put on a sour look, and faced Nadir. ""It is … quite awful. Foul and disgusting; unholy even."" She replied, putting the brown wafer into a small pocket. ""It must be burned. I'll dispose of it as soon as we set up camp for the night.""
Nadir nodded his head in thought. ""Hmm. A shame. I wonder why a stone golem would be hiding something so awful.""
Nadir handed Parallax a small pouch of gold pieces. Soon, the two were off, trekking through the desert again. Parallax tried to hide a sly smile. She couldn't help but think of the delicious beauty of the brown wafer, and made plans to have a little piece of it every night before she fell asleep.

"""Shit, there goes another one."" General Turr mumbled to, Taek, his first officer, ""They're getting a lot more accurate, they used to miss by a few thousand kilometres.""
Turning the ship towards the newly arrived HomoSapien space liner, the Exerprise H56, the Kantian war ship set about tracking the liner and getting all of its clearances and passes checked.
""Yeah, but they are still missing the safe zones. If it weren't for the jelly shields of the Salec's their FTL travel would've been banned.""
The liner is easily one of the smallest ships currently docked at the way spacion, the HomoSapiens had only discovered their FTL travel 20 years ago. The Kantian's, Salec's, Maltuin's and Delfanit's were shocked, never thinking that a species with only two arms could create such technology.
""It's Unorthodox, Unsafe and Damn Stupid! It UUDS!"" The council meetings had been plagued with these words for ages.
Taek, going through each clearance code with a meticulousness that only he could, motions to the debris trail left behind the liners ""If we shared our technology with them, they could travel through the gates.""
""It would also decrease the bloody clean-up required each time.""
""You know we can't, the treaty stands and the human ships aren't dense enough to handle the radiation."" The general replies, not mentioning that the few ships that have tried it crashed into each other.
""How, exactly do they even travel this far anyway? It would seem that their ships and bodies wouldn't be able to handle the forces."" Taek asks for the millionth time.
""Well, they have this theory of relativity, which says the faster you travel the more mass you have. It overcomplicated all of their scientific endeavours."" The general begins, earning a collective moan from everyone awake in the warships control room.
""So when they started travelling at close to light speed they just assumed that they couldn't travel as fast or faster. They built engines that can get to 80% the speed of light, which is something our ships do with impulse engines.""
""That only took them to the edge of their own solar system, something admirable but it still confined them to their own corner. The Salec wave riders were considering helping them to travel faster, however, about 21 years ago when they sent a probe ship, they found rings the size of moons being placed on the edges of their solar system."" He pauses to ensure that Taek is still listening, which of course he is.
""Curious the Salec's stood back and watched. The humans had somehow discovered how to warp space but only between two set places. Their warp drives also temporarily increased their speed to 3 FTL, which they still haven't entirely realised.""
This next bit is where the council is still struggling to accept the HomoSapiens as a race, the council usually worked well together on making decisions, but dangerous travel that still worked was a grey area. Every other race were too cautious to attempt something unkown.
""Well, to start traversing through space, the humans would travel from their home planet at the maximum speed they can travel. Aiming straight for the warp gates, at first, but eventually at different angles. This caused them to easily travel to new solar systems. It also made it difficult for them to actually stop.""
""Which is why their first three ships flew straight into, in order or severity, the council war fleet, the council's moon of operations and the dwarf star of the Antraci system. Total count of death combined was well over 100-million.""
""Of course after catching the attention of the council and several other alien races the HomoSapiens eventually made contact with us and we were able to stop their exploration ships before more damage could be caused. The thing that surprised most races was that after three failed attempts the humans were still attempting FTL travel.""
""It wasn't until first contact that the Salec's realised that humans were still using Radio waves to communicate across vast distances. But, that advancement in their tech is a whole different story and involves several strange messages that either offended everyone or caused peace treaties to be made with the Andromeda Galaxy.""

"I size up the woman in front of me. Shiny gray spandex, long cape, one of those silly little masks on her face. The Silver Bullet, fastest woman in the world. Groan.
How will I wreck her? There are lots of options with super-speed, as several of my late enemies can attest. Bolt died of starvation after expending a small city's daily calorie intake in ten seconds. Zoomerang stripped the flesh from his own bones when he discovered air resistance. And Captain Velocity shattered his spine like a rabbit with a single overly-energetic kick.
I'm not your average supervillain--you know, I don't even like that term. What I do is necessary. All these superheroes, they're flashy and loveable, but they're dangerous. Ask anyone to recount how Captain Adonis stopped Doctor Catastrophe from nuking Topeka, and you'll be regaled with a forty-minute blow-by-blow epic. But they probably won't mention that the city was leveled anyway by the fighting.
All I do is bring these folks back to earth a little. I was born with the power, if you care to call it that, to reassert the laws of nature. I can break the convenient but unnatural circumvention of physics that other superheroes are born with--typically to fatal effect. Ask Firebrand.
I take a step toward Silver Bullet. I imagine the contrast my dark three-piece suit must make with her ostentatious costume--I like to think of myself as a little more practical than these superhero types.
""Silver Bullet,"" I begin. ""You must know my reputation, and you must know there's no way out of this for you. Give yourself up, and I promise you'll be treated fairly. Confinement in the Tower of Penitence is better than death, you know.""
The Tower of Penitence is where I keep all the superheroes who surrender to me. Well, where I would keep them if they did surrender. It's empty.
She looks at me with what seems to be pity. Overconfidence, the one constant of that varied crew. ""I'd extend you the same offer. This doesn't have to end in violence.""
""I'm sorry to hear that,"" I reply. ""In that case, I suppose --""
A loud crack shatters the still air, and I freeze. Her speed--worked? How...
I feel a pain in my abdomen, where she must have punched me. I stagger back, jaw agape. This is impossible. I look up, falling to my knees in shock...and see Silver Bullet holstering her gun.",0
"I had about 5 seconds to get used to lying on my back and frankly I was comfortable there until the 6th second rolled around and someone kicked me in the gut. You know what that feels like? A good solid kick in the gut that wakes you right up and rearranges your priorities in a hurry starting with ""make that not happen again, please"".
So I was pretty pissed when I opened my eyes, breath gathered ready to swear the first person I saw into oblivion. That it was me made me pause halfway through ""Sonovvua-""
It was me.
I'd kicked me.
Or at least me with breasts, muscles and glasses, none of which I remembered having. I put my face in my hands, rubbed my eyes with my palms and opened them again to see, yup. Lady Me. Me'Lady in fact. There could be no question.
""Uh"" I said like the eloquent conversationalist I am.
And she responded with, in my voice but falsetto, ""Shut up. I know you have questions. Frankly we all do. But if you're anything like the others you'll wait like we've been waiting too.""
This didn't help. So instead I edged myself onto my elbows and looked around. Me and Me'lady were in a bright white walled room with one transparent wall that looked onto a corridor with other such rooms.
She'd planted herself (myself?) against the opposite wall and it took me a few more seconds before my head was clear enough for words.
When I did, it was, ""Hello"" because you've got to start with hello.
Or not, because she didn't reciprocate.
So instead I asked, ""So....there's a lot of those eh?""
""Those? "", she raised an eyebrow and it looked just like I'd always thought I looked like when I did that.
""The rooms with....us...in them""
""Yup. Listen do you remember anything?""
I couldn't. And I had a feeling she was expecting that to be the answer. So instead I asked her, ""Does any of us? Also, why did you kick me? If you broke a kidney and I need a replacement I know I'm taking one of yours.""
""Pipe down smartass. And no, none of us remember. There's a girl 3 rooms down who says he's been here for an hour. No one across from him knows morse so we don't know how many of...us there are. And I kicked you because the alternative was listening to you snore and these rooms are soundproof. You know that by the way? You snore?"" That voice, it was mine but different. Like if I'd pinched my throat and done an impression of a lady. Like that, but...natural. Real. And lovely. Apparently I loved hearing the sound of my own voice.
Suffice to say that presented more questions than it answered and I'd only just thought of the first I was going to ask when a voice boomed through the room and we both looked up at the perforated surface of a white painted speaker on the wall.
""ATTENTIO-! Oh, sorry about that, is it low? I lowered the volume, it should be okay now. Anyways. Hi! I am Cid. Yes, yes I know, we're ALL Cid, it's very droll but I'm Cid the original. Cid in fact, of this universe. Which none of you in fact are. of this universe that is. I'm really really sorry about that but uh, apparently, there are side effects that we weren't really ready for, and after the first dozen of....us, uh, we, just kept coming and coming. We didn't even have a place to store and categorize all of you until a few hours ago. Sorry about the rooms by the way, it was all we had until we could sort this whole mess out.
Hm.
Speaking of which, I guess I should tell you all, me? Us. I should tell all of us that this is, technically, and I cannot stress this enough, ACCIDENTALLY, my fault. Ish. Sort of. Look I'm just saying no one could have seen this. Like no one could have predicted this would happen. We just turned it on for a few minutes and then you, I, we started just streaming through like it was a house party. And then we couldn't turn it off and on again because it wouldn't turn off and we don't know why it's still on except we can't turn it off. You see, one of us, across multiple dimensions, mine in fact, the one you're all...we're all in now was a scientist at CERN. Me in fact. Working on the ol' LHC. That's the the Large Hadron Collider. It uh, broke the dimensional barrier. But I'm sure I can fix it. We've called Brian Cox already and he said to turn it off and on again like we haven't already tried that, the sellout. Just wait and don't do anything rash or....erotic which I notice some of you..me..us...ew. Just ew. Just keep your pants on guys. And gals I guess. I guess I'm only single in THIS dimension then. Brilliant.""
There was the brief thud of a mic being put on a table and a distant, ""Shit, I turned the speaker off, is still playing?""
And then there was the whine of a fading tannoy system.",0
"I stare at the phone skeptically as it continues to ring. After the third ring, I answer. Hello? who is this? ""Hello, Mr. Ross. It's good to hear you found it, and right on time, it seems"". What? How do you know me? When did you put this phone here? *looks around*....Where are you? ""Why do you ask? Are you concerned that I might be hidden somewhere nearby? I can assure you, I'm not. But if you're really that worried I'll give you some time to search the area and collect your thoughts. I'll call you back in exactly fifteen minutes""............He hung up.... No number in the caller ID either...
I look around again. I'm in a small clearing, in a wooded area, about two miles from the road, on private property. At an old campsite I used to use when I was a kid. There's no trace of anyone. It's mid autumn, so the ground is strewn with fallen leaves. The plot where my time capsule was supposed to be appeared untouched before I started digging. Mostly covered with leaves, a little grass. How did he know when to call?
I spend about ten minutes exploring the area in search of a camera. First I look for any incoming wires that I might've missed on my way in. nothing. maybe it's wireless and there's a transmitter nearby? That might explain why the phone has signal here. Or maybe a motion sensor in the phone triggered the call. Who would do something like this?
Is it a prank? I didn't tell anyone I was coming. Hell, until this morning I didn't Know I was coming here. So how would anyone else? *riiing* *riiing*. Hello? ""Time's up Mr Ross. Did you find anything"". Not a thing. What do you want? ""My my, impatient aren't you? Perhaps we should get to know one another first."" Sure thing, just tell me where you are and we'll have a nice long chat. ""Very well. Meet me at your favorite caffe. You know the one"". *Click*. What caffe? I haven't been to a caffe in.... how could he even know that? I've never told anyone.
(I've never really written anything before, so if this sucks, I'm genuinely sorry. I know the story seems vague so far but I have some interesting plot points in mind...I just don't know how to add them without extending the story...and being that I'm not a writer at all..... this is hard....But if anyone happens to like it I can keep going)",0
"The walls of Xebar-70 shook like an earthquake in the sky. We zoomed past clawed fingers of lightning which tried to lash our ship's boxed exterior. And even as ice chunks slammed into the pilot pod, I held the wheel with white-knuckled fists and pushed on. Doreen frowned at me from her co-pilot seat. ""Pull back,"" she said.
Screams echoed up from the hull as we rose against deep turbulence. ""You know I can't do that,"" I said through gritted teeth.
""You're going to kill these people.""
I turned on her. ""They're dead if we go back! If it isn't a blasted storm it's the bloody Nuria government officials. And personally, I'd rather face a storm.""
Another set of screams echoed up from the hull. The refugees didn't have seat belts or motion stabilizers, so with every bump we made, they felt it ten fold below.
Doreen's face was as dark as the sky when she turned back to her control panel. I'd seen that look during negotiations with the Nurian republic. The same look she had when they declined to release our people. And it was still across her face when she said we would break them out.
The steering wheel vibrated in my hands as I pulled up toward the lightest patch of cloud I could find. ""Spinners x-30, Mid-levellers north, boosters on thrust. We're going to make it out of this *bitch! *""
It was a play on luck and experience. I'd weathered a worse storm in Carvali, and even then I'd had two boosters less and a much smaller ship. We could do this, I was sure of it.
Doreen tapped at various spots on the control panel. ""Mid-levellers aren't responding. Boosters online, Spinners x-30.""
The ship's vibration stabilized slightly and we cruised on toward the cloud bed above. No Mid-levellers meant the ship would shake once we hit the cloud, and our passengers would get the worst of it.
Suddenly, purple blotches seeped through the sky.
""Bloody shit. It's a Storm beast,"" I hissed.
""Okay, now we really have to go back, Dean. This is no longer a discussion. Turn - the - ship -around. Now!""
A storm beast was a bird of sorts. When I say of sorts, I mean it looks a lot like a pterodactyl that's wide enough to span a storm. The thing carries so much static energy with it that it changes the colour of the sky purple. However, its focus would be on decimating the land below. I hoped.
I looked at Doreen and placed a hand on the thrust lever. She stared back with wide eyes. ""You can't, Dean. You're going to kill us. Please, listen.""
""I wouldn't do this if I didn't have to, come on, Doreen. You know this is it. Are you with me or not?""
She stared at my hand and then placed her shaky palm on top and squeezed. I lifted my chin toward the heavens, prepared to clash with the beast above.
""*Shit. Shit. Shit. * Please, God..."" Doreen whispered.
""We're going to make it through. I swear,"" I said.
We burst into the clump of purple cloud. My teeth chattered from the force tearing at the ship. Doreen squeezed my hand and pulled down on the thruster, accelerating. The screams of the refugees were muddled in with the groaning of metal. And then as we burst over the edge of the cloud, we saw it.
A silver bird, its body covered in blotches of purple. For a moment I almost mistook it for the sky itself. Its dark black pupils widened in surprise as we shot past. A small spec in a chasm of awesome power.
Stopping only when we were safe in outerspace.",0
"The silence was the first thing she noticed as she strode in, usually her roommate was so happy, so loud, so.. annoying. It was what she had come to dread about heading home, what should have been a comforting reprieve from her lessons was what pushed her to do more work and stay as far from home as possible.
Her footsteps echoed through the hall, anticipating the likely prank and how best to avoid it; a bucket on a door? a weakened floorboard? something new? But no, nothing happened as of yet, the only oddity being a game boy on the floor. She ambled towards her room and tentatively pushed his door open, jumping back when it creaked and shaking her head, embarrassed at her own fear. He was probably just out, partying, or *socialising*.
But a thought nagged at her as lay on her bed, a thought she couldn't quite place, but yet still caused her trouble. She rose, and started to stride towards the kitchen, an easy escape from anxiety. But, passing her roommates room, a whimper reached her ears, a whimper so feeble and miserable that it would have moved the heart of the most impassive politician.
As she entered the room, the whimper stopped, the silence settling like a smog.
A shaking head was visible behind his bedside dresser, and as she stepped towards him it stiffened, as still as the silence. He glanced at her as she passed the corner of the bed and visibly relaxed before motioning violently for her to get down, mouthing indecipherable words, but the meaning was discernible, to hide, or go.
As her mind sifted through the confusion of what could possibly be happening, the front door creaked open, and her roommate stopped, still as jock concentrating on math. Footsteps advanced in a perfectly even pattern, and a white-gloved hand grabbed the frame of the doorway, a sinister voice shattering the silence, her heart stopping for a moment.
""It's a me, Mario!""",0
"""Wow, he is everything I've always dreamed of. Slightly tall, dark hair, long fingers, a nose that is large but noble in a way, even endearing mole on the cheek. And that voice...there has to be something wrong with him. He can't be this perfect.""
::Sex begins::
""Wow, she's really professional, look at how into it she is. The way her eyes look at me, the way her body thrusts against me with passion I've never felt in my life...She is really good at her job!""
""Oh God, I'm cumming so hard. I've never been with a man like this. It's like my body and soul were was made for his.""
""Wow, she really looks like she's cumming. Jesus, if I didn't know better, I'd think she actually was. What a professional. If only I could have this kind of passion in real life.
::scene ends, they clean up::
The beautiful Amanda compliments him on his performance both with words and a look in her eyes that instantly pierces and melts his heart.

Fuck this gay earth.""",0
"In utter shock and disbelief, Harry's eyes caught that of Draco and his goons, all of them smirking in delight. Draco muttered words which Harry couldn't hear, though he could imagine they were likely things awaiting him once he was left alone in Slytherin's common room.
Walking down the steps, Harry had a burning desire to rip off the hat which has effectively doomed his future in Hogwarts with one single word. The disappointment in the eyes of Ron and Hermione only sparked the temptation further.
With heavy steps, Harry walked towards the sea of green robes, feeling all eyes on him with every step. He glanced at an empty spot towards the very end of the long chair and made his way there, but not before Crabbe and Goyle sandwiched him between their shoulders as he walked past.
Harry sat alone, oblivious to the sound of the Sorting Hat deciding the fate of the next student and the roar from the rest of the crowd. He was all alone in the nest of vipers.
""Perhaps Uncle Vernon's closet was not a bad place after all"", he silently thought as tears welled up in his eyes",0
"It all started on a Wednesday. It was just a typical Wednesday and there was nothing special at all about it. The sun wasn't shining, the birds weren't chirping, and there sure as hell wasn't anything to suggest that this would be the day my entire life would be changed forever. There was that feeling though. The feeling I've had my entire life. The feeling that someone, somewhere, was watching me over my shoulder. Observing me. Waiting for the right opportunity to approach me. But for what? My friends called me paranoid when I tell them about this ""feeling"" but you know as well as I do that you've had this feeling too. The feeling that something is sitting just over your right shoulder and you can feel them there. But then you turn around and...Nothing.
I was walking down 4th ave when I saw it. It was sitting on a table outside one of those outdoor cafés. A letter, with nothing but the words, ""read this Mark"" on it. I'm not even sure why I it drew my attention, or why I picked it up. It could have been for anyone named Mark (This is New York City, there's a million Marks). Come to think of it, why hadn't anyone else picked it up before me? After I grabbed it, I didn't know if I should have sat right down and read it, or ran home with it. There I go again, with the whole paranoia thing. ""Ok, Calm down Mark, your tripping out, and you need to relax man"" Said the friendly little voice inside my head. I put the letter in my pocket, and started walking home with it, trying to draw as little attention to myself as possible.
I sat down on my couch and put the letter down on the coffee table in front of me. My mind began to wander from place to palce, and my focus grew wein and tired. This happened quite a bit, everytime I sat down for too long, or grew complacent in any task I was doing. I've gotten it checked out before, and the doctors always tell me it's nothing. ""Just drink some water to calm down"" they say, ""It's probably just caused by anxiety and stress"". I try and tell them that this is different, that something is fundamentally wrong with my mind, but they never listen. It was soon thereafter that I walked over to the fridge to get some water to calm my pacing heart, and as I began pouring water into the cup I was now holding, I noticed another note attached to it. ""It's time to read the letter, Mark"". I don't need to tell you what went through my mind the next 10 minutes, before I finally did get around to opening up that letter.
I was expecting a few paragraphs telling me what was going on, but all I was given was 4 haunting sentences. ""Do you remember where you were from 1918 to 1920, Mark? Do you remember what happened to you? Because I do. And if your ready, I can show you"".
That's all it said. It would be quite impossible for me to remember what I was doing during those years, because it was 60 years before I was born. As a matter of fact, it was 30 years before even my Father was born.
Ok, whoever you are, I'm ready. ""IM READY!!"" I screamed. nothing. Well, that was pointless. My friends and I are accustom to playing pranks on each other, but they have always been light hearted. Never anything this...eerie. They also understand how paranoid I can be and are sensitive towards it. What fun is a prank if everyone doesn't laugh afterwards, right? No, this doesn't feel like my friends at all.
I walked over to where I keep my phone, thinking that maybe I can call some people I know that might be behind this or at the very least, can help me find out who is. I open the drawer and I see a book that I'm sure wasn't there before. Its hard to explain, but this book looks very old and used, but it also looks as if it was taken care of...Like it was a very valuable possesion for someone. On the front cover, it said, ""The Diary of a man"", written in what im sure is really old blood. I skim through it real quick and see every entry starts with a day number and words written in pencil. There are long entries and short entries. I felt the ever growing bubble of anxiety in my chest, taking over my mental functioning and reasoning. All I knew, and the only thing I could make sense of, was that I needed to open that book and read it. I opened it to the first page and the writing looked...familiar. But I had no time for that, I needed to read the book and figure out whats going on.
Day 4: WHO ARE YOU? LET ME GO
Day 5: I know you took this from me last night. I know it. WHO ARE YOU?
Day 6: whoever might read this: Please help me. Im trapped in this room. It has no windows, only a bed, a sink, a toilet, a clock.. and this book. One of the walls is a big mirror. I know someone's on the other side looking at me. PLEASE LET ME OUT.
day 7: I dont understand whats going on. At 8am and 5pm someone slides food through the little small opening on the bottom of the door. Atleast the food is good, they keep serving me fishsticks. I love fish sticks. PLEASE LET ME GO.
Day 8: nothing makes sense to me anymore. im stuck in nothingness. Nothing happens. I eat twice a day, but no one say a thing. All I ever see is the one hand that slides the food through twice a day. I yell but I know its no help. I've yelled every single time and no one answers. No one ever answers.
Day 9: fishsticks for lunch and fish sticks for dinner are getting old quick.
this goes on, day after day. I can see whats going on here. But who is this guy? Why do I have this? Nothing makes sense. I cant read every entry, I needed to know what was going on quick.
Day 30: I fucking cant do this anymore. My life is nothing. I can't leave my mind. Its all I have. And this book. do you know how slow your life becomes when you stare at a clock and say every second out loud for 4 hours straight? I have nothing.
I skipped a few more pages.
Day 54: I dont know how I got here. I...cant really remember where I was or what I was doing before I got here. I remember being at home, cooking dinner, than something hit me. I know it hit me in the back of the head because I could still feel it when I woke up in here. I feel like they have total control over my mind. I feel like they have erased some memory of mine...A memory that is very important to me understanding why I am here. You know who Im talking about. The people behind the mirror. I can feel them everyday. Watching me, observing me.
I skip a few more pages still.
Day 79: I deserve to be here. I alienated everyone that ever tried to get into my life. I havent talked to my parents in years. The girlfriends ive had, ive lost...Always my fault. Does anyone even know im gone? Are they even looking for me? I doubt it. I am just a man who disapeared, and no one even noticed.
A few more pages..
Day 104: FUCK YOU FISH STICKS! I FUCCKING HATE YOU.
I just dont really understand whats going on. Im about to put the diary down and smoke a bowl, when the page next page catches my eye, and it felt like someone had ripped my heart out of my chest.

"I plopped into my seat next to Greg. He turned his head, glancing over at me, even though he wasn't surprised that I would sit there. Greg was a middle aged man with a balding head and a sort of jolly persona. Nothing about his life was jolly though.
He quickly looked back down at his phone, typing furiously and muttering under his breath.
""I've tried it all, Jim,"" he finally said, shaking his head back and forth like a madman. ""Novelty accounts, memes, well-informed posts filled with information (we both looked at each other and chuckled), but I just don't know how to break out.""
I nodded my head and motioned to the bartender. He was one of the lucky few that got karma rich. I sighed. I just didn't have it, and the most frustrating thing was I didn't know what to improve on. Getting karma was some sort of weird skill that will always remain unattainable.
I ordered a drink and then pulled out my phone, letting the back of my hand to rest against the sleek wood of the bar. I looked back over at Greg, still shaking his head and muttering. No family, no money, no faith. I didn't want to end up like that.
I knew what to do.
I pulled out my phone. I sent a text post on the subreddit that gave me the most karma of them all (me_irl, they'll upvote anything) saying thank you for supporting me but that's it. I'm going die.
And to my surprise, after a few minutes of self-loathing reflection, my karma count went up and up. Countless replies of ""me too thanks"" flooded my inbox. I couldn't believe it, I was rich!
""I did it!"" I shouted. ""Top trending post on me_irl with only 200 upvotes and in ten minutes!""
I was laughing. I was crying. The faces seated at the bar were a blur, I felt Greg's congratulating hand on my shoulder, ""free drinks on the house! "", ""me too thanks! "", my life flashed before my eyes, a life with an infinite amount future of possibilities.

I slowly pressed submit. This was my last chance of success. Of Karma. Of a successful life. I close my eyes and hope that the people of Writing Prompts will upvote my story and save me.

""Shut up George.""
""Tonight we create an abomination. We tread upon God's feet, the folly of humankind -""
""No more of this shit, George! If you want to go onto these fucking monologues, you should have been a fucking writer.""
""Screw you too Blake.""
Blake moved up to adjust the camera. It began to focus onto his scrubs and his surgical mask. He pointed it onto the podium where a mechanical sphere lay, connected by wires into the building.
""We're copying a human mind. The wires lead over to our patient. Who isn't being tortured by demons in the basement, like George's monologue would have you think. Completely painless procedure, just tracking brain signals and the like. It'll take a few hours or so to install.""
Blake pointed over to a human body made of chrome and silver metal.
""That's the body we have housing the metal brain. Should be an exact replica of our patient, except a cyborg. Pretty damn cool, huh?""
He shifted the camera, panning to a rather smug looking Greg.
""*INSTALLATION COMPLETE*""
Blake hurriedly aimed the camera back at the brain and body.
""Well, that was a lot faster than I expected.""
""Yeah, Blake. You're welcome. Turns out that my genius mind isn't just good at monologues. Turns out I'm pretty good at a lot of stuff, huh?""
""Yeah, George, good work. Say, how do we put it in?""
""You don't know? Is this another thing that I'm useful for?""
""Oh seriously? I'm a god-damned doctor and psychologist. You know I don't work with machinery like this.""
""Then watch as we commit the ultimate sin of pride by recreating God's own work.""
As George placed the brain into the body through the top of the skull, wires left small holes in the brain, exploring its new storage. They latched onto small connections within the head of the machine body. George lifted his hands from the brain as the hole closed shut. Cameras came out of where its eyes should have been. It whirred, moving its hand in front of its face, as though making sure it were well and truly alive.
""It's alive!"" Blake shouted. The Frankenstein reference was ignored by George, who eagerly studied the robot. A speaker emerged and it spoke its first words.
""An abomination! Oh, never let me see the light of day, for it will melt through to the metal core of me! I was never meant to live!""
Blake paused, in shock. George stood by the robot, still smug as all hell.
""George.... You didn't...""
""Yup.""
""Do you have any idea how much is at stake here?""
""Of course I do. I know my own intellect is far greater than our patient's. Hence my actions.""
""George you little fuck! You just copied yourself into our only robot! The! ONLY! ONE! IN THE WORLD!""
Blake chased George as he dodged around the table in circles. The robot watched them passively before turning towards the camera.

"**DAY 1**
Well, I'm Alive. That's pretty much the best thing I can say today. All the training, all the study, the practice and routine, didn't amount to anything really. They tell you how to plan, to coordinate, communicate, move as a team, how to follow orders without question and the moment you enter the battle you realize its all for shit.
The plans go out the window, the equipment you need to fight is missing or broken. What you do have gets destroyed by the stray mortar you heard screaming over your head, giving you just enough time to duck behind the water truck before your ears slip with reverberating ringing so loud you can't tell what the person next to you is saying. The bully at boot camp who pretended to be so tough is now whimpering in the foxhole while others of the team are shaking so hard they can't even hold their M16s. That's when you realize, you're screwed!
The lieutenant isn't any help, hell, he just graduated from Officer's Candidate School last month and its hard to tell if he has any more experience at fighting than ourselves. To make matters worse, he had to inform us this morning on our Rules of Engagement given to us by the pompous politicians in Washington:
* no firing first
* only fire back when under live fire ourselves
* and only fire back when we have approved permission
How the hell is that suppose to work? I didn't come here to just die because some elitist thinks it might be seen as provocative if we happen to kill a few noncombatants. I'm pretty sure they told me we were fighting a war, not participating in some UN mission. I know I had a reason why I thought this was the right thing to do with my life but I've got the feeling I just made a big mistake.
--------------
**The End**
It was a good day today; One I won't forget. Tim and the boys went all out. I don't know how they got all the party decoration or the cheesecake for that matter, but I couldn't care. God, it tasted good. I can't remember the last time that smooth silk of sweet cream aroused such a sense of euphoria in my mouth. I almost cried.
The guys even got Lindsey on the satcom for me while they sang in the background. Just hearing her voice and knowing the next time I said a word to her, I will be looking her into her eyes. Those amazingly beautiful pools of irresistible sapphire blue. I can't get home soon enough.
Yet, to leave my men, my team, my friends, my brothers behind. It's as if a part of me is being surgically removed during an emergency field operation. The pain of loss is almost unbearable. Looking at their faces as I left the party was like remembering a loved one during a funeral. Memories coursing through my mind of our trip to hell and damnation then back again. I can see the faces of those that didn't make it: Rob, Michael, Danny, Lenny, Sinclair, and Stevo among others. How is this fair? They were better men than me, better fathers, better husbands, better examples of character. I feel that I should be the one giving my last full measure so they can be the ones to retire happily with their families.
No one who has lived and survived the inhuman nature of war, only to go home to a world you know little about and have limited capability to act within a culture of civilians, understands the reality that is the mental destruction of your being. How do you face the relentless questions about your welfare and your mental state, the constant curiosity of their ignorance and the barrage of criticism from those you gave your life to defend so they can call you *Baby Killer*, *Murderer*, and worse. How will I get through the day without suppressing that urge to smash their face into the nearest wall for their inconsiderate babel?
My only hope for survival is the cabin in the high mountains of Colorado, away from the crowds and urbanites. A place where I can wonder at the majesty of the 14'ers as their snow covered peaks stretch north to south along the great divide. The cool crisp air calming my nerves while Lindsey and I sit out on the deck and watch the Caribou gallop through the yard. A solace that alleviates the anguish of my mind.
So, with 22 years of my life spent on 4 military engagements in 3 countries and 12 years on the front lines, it has come to this; the end. To all those who have served with dignity and honor, who have known the reality of war and made it home, I join your Band of Brothers. Semper Fi.",0
"The Sky is a deep, emerald green. Not that you could look at it with the naked eye, mind you. The copper sulphate emulsion in the atmosphere would do strange things to your body. I've seen it before, right after the bomb fell.
Moscow, now that was a mess. I mean, we watched the cloud expand over the city, expanding from the blast sight. And yeah it was horrible but we all told ourselves it was the only way. The death of over 6 million people in return for peace seemed like an okay deal. We waited for the world to come together in the wake of such a tragedy.
And then the reaction didn't stop. That green cloud ate everything up. The streets of Moscow became the streets of Paris, then Beijing, then New York. We watched from underground, us fortunate few. Thousands survived in bunkers and sealed facilities. Hundreds died of starvation and asphyxiation in the first months. Clean air became as precious a commodity as water. It was a special kind of hell that only the living could ever suffer. Those months were the hardest.
Maybe a year on, things settled down. People got used to living under a poison sky. A lot of ‘ em got used to the feel of a survival suit. Some of em got used to the feel of a gun barrel in their mouth. I was one of the latter party. Shrinks said it was survivor guilt, that I shouldn't feel bad for having survived where so many had died.
Of course I know better. I know why I feel like shit. Why I can't ever not feel like this.
I trudge down the corridor of the Cheyenne mountain complex. I was stationed here when shit went down. Lucky me. The survival suit is heavy. It reminds me of a space suit a lot. The entire thing is designed to protect from extreme environmental hazards. You can barely move your head in the helmet so i keep it off when i don't need it.
I make my way to the surface access tunnel. A heavy set of steel doors have been permanently sealed. I won't ever need to get a bus to pass through them again. To the left they've set up a vacuum sealed chamber for entering and exiting the safety of the bunker.
I know the deal by now. No need for them to run through the safety procedure but they do anyway. The same guy as the last dozen times runs me through the capabilities of my gear, all the while he gives me a dead eyed look. I recognise him, as always. He was on base, in the command centre, when it happened. He knows the truth.
He lets me go and I step into the chamber. When the yellow lights start flashing I reluctantly attach the helmet. The world is rendered into a dim orange blur by the tinted glass of the view screen. What a miserable colour to see then world in.
After a few minutes I hear the exterior door crack open. The light rush of toxic air rumbles around my suit. I wait for a moment and then step outside.
Nobody ever cleared up the bodies. Not even outside the bunker. Nobody has the time or the patience to clear up the biggest crime scene in history. I walk through it all, stumbling and feeling my way forward because all I can see is the orange interior of my own face plate. I bounce against something and I fall flat on my ass.
I cry, much like I cried when the world ended. Except then it was understandable. I remember the stunned silence as the bomb fell. I remember the pats on my back when the bomb hit the target dead centre. General Murry made a big deal out of me. He called me ""The man who fired the last shot."" I only wish he hadn't been so right.
Murry is dead now. He didn't have the balls to face up to what we did. He disappeared right after the cloud hit the east coast. Nobody was really bothered with finding him. I may very well have stumbled over his corpse.
Alone, without the reassurances of the shrinks or the other survivors it sinks in. I killed the world. It was my drone, my payload, my decision that ended all wars.
I lay on my back and look up. I try to make out the sky. All I see is orange. Before it ends, I really, really want to see the sky. I raise my hands to the seals on my helmet.
It hurts, a lot. My lungs burn. It feels like I've swallowed hot coals. My skin begins to tingle. No doubt it's blooming into an array of strange colours. My vital processes shut down quickly. My breathing stops, rendered irrelevant by the complete destruction of my lungs. Without air to fill my blood, my heart slows and stops.
But the sky, the sky is the most beautiful shade of green.",0
"Every day is the same. Wake up, gather materials for cooking and place it on the heat stone.
This one has been in my family for years. We're proud of it because it can be moved.
That's why my grand mother is the head of our village. She inherited the heat stone so she's the He-Kith. It is also our scribestone.
One day I'll be the He-kith so I have to learn the stories. The writing. The history.
Our scribestone requires that I know how to engrave the stories. And every day it's empty ready for new ones.
My favorite part of the year is the retelling. When the He-kith touches the scribestone and we can see the old stories as if they had just been engraved.
It's time for the retelling and she touches the stone and our Ka-ette are gathered around to see the stories of this last year and for them to be retold. I listen raptly but also watch every little detail knowing that I will have to do this one day too. And then my children. And their children.
Each day appears on the scribestone with a rumble and the stone receding to show the new engravings.
Our first day of this year. After the harvest. And what we harvested and what we will plant. We find that if we don't scribe in what we will plant we have a drier year. We always write what we will plant. Failure means some may die from hunger.
The day of the festival of stars where we engrave the stars above us on the scribestone. We always know when it's time because the scribestone turns black but has a blue glow. On that day we etch in the new stars, turn around and do it again. I don't understand why we do this but so many of our traditions must be kept whether we know why or not.
Here comes the etchings of life where we enter the names of those who are born and their Ka-hen and of course our Ka-ette, Ra.
Now for the etchings of passing where we see the names of those who passed on. And their places of plantings.
As we prepare for the next engraving there's a shifting of the ground beneath us. And a loud screeching sound.
The scribestone changes to a red color. I've never seen that before and from the look of my He-Kith's face neither has she. Panic sets in and many of our Ka-ette scramble to their feet and run to their homes.
But not my He-Kith and so I too will stay. I'm terrified.
Above us the sky opens like it does during the festival of stars and the scribe stone turns black. My He-kith grabs the writing stone but her hand is shaking. She too is terrified. She etches in a star and the scribestone glows orange and turns flat. She tries again. Same thing. She calls to me and hands me the writing stone.
I take it and slowly etch in the stars. And wait for it to flash but my hands must have been steadier because it sets in and the stone makes the whirring sound it does during the festival of stars. I repeat the process for the brightest stars as I had been taught and the stone turns gray.
And then something new happens. The sky begins to paint circles over the stars and to draw lines and emblems on them. The were names. Names of our Ka-ette. And our neighboring Ka-ette.
And next to each one is a emblem. The word for ""end of harvest"". All except for the Kith-den.
I wait for hours staring at the sky trying to make sense of what is happening when a young girl from the village of Kith-den runs up. Their He-Kith is dead. The fright from the sky and sound scared her so much that she died. And their successor can't be found. They searched but she must have run away. I don't blame her. The thought crossed my mind.
My He-Kith tells me that I must go to their village and complete the ritual of the festival of the stars. I don't want to. I want to stay here with my mother and sisters. Or run to the fields to my father and brothers. But she insists.
After much prodding and reminding me that she is too old to make such a journey I go with the young girl.
As we approach her village I see their scribestone laying on the ground next to their He-kith who seemed as one who passed in their sleep. I pick it up but it doesn't shift or change or make a sound. I don't know what to do so I give up and lay it on their He-kith and as it touches her it turns black and I pick it up again. I quickly but carefully etch in the stars and as I do I see the sky paint Ka-den.
Suddenly the sky turns black and then it becomes bright as day. And then in the sky we see a woman. She looks down on us and speaks. But it sounds odd. Like the words of old. I can make out most of it. She says we have reached the harvest home. The place of our final rest. Our journey is done.
As she speaks we see a blue orb appear and she tells us that our ""boat?"" has arrived at ""Err-arth"". Home of homes.
The scribestone then changes to a faint green and a single symbol etches on it. ""Plant"" I think it says. It looks like plant but it's different. I circle the etching and the scribestone then shatters into dust throwing me back. And the sky changes to show Ka-den green and moving towards the blue orb in the sky.
Shortly after I see Ka-ette, Ka-tul, Ka-ren and thousands of others in green and moving towards the blue orb. All except for one. ""Ka-mune"". Theirs turns red and then fades away. And shortly after I see a white plume and a huge white/grey sphere fly away up the horizon followed by a huge flame. And then it's gone. Into the stars.
Then the great change. First the lake dried. Followed by the mountains which turned to dust just as the scribestone did. Then the houses in the village turned to dust leaving only the few inhabitants who hadn't run away from the village but rather had huddled in their homes. Their belongings still there but the walls were just gone.
The blue orb sets in the sky and we see a new orb. A bright whitish/yellow one. And a painted etching ""Fire source"" and then a light rumbling as the ground vibrates beneath my feet and the horizon glows a faint red. This glow is slowly replaced by a bluish colors and the stars fade away. I've never seen a sky without stars before. But in their place is the ""Fire source"".
More rumbling and then the ground stops vibrating and then a loud whoosh and a bright flash.
I huddle down in fear as I see the horizon change. There are new mountains. And a large lake where the old one used to be. And I hear a strange high pitched sound as a creature soars above me.
I run back to where my village was and I find my He-kith and she looks at me with such joy and fear on her face. She puts her hand on me and hands me the etching stone and points to a opening in the nearby mountain.
I run in and see a wall that looks like the scribestone and use my etching stone to write the story of what just happened. The words stay. But they don't move. These aren't like our scribestone. Or the mountains of our home where the words could be read from generations before. These stay but can't be reused.
I write and I write. Every day in our new home. I write what I see. What I hear.
And most of all the stars. They don't change during the festival of stars like they used to. They are the same. They move. But always come back. Just as Ka-mune circles Err-arth, perhaps watching over us?
Edit: typos and clarity a few plot holes.",0
"""Mommy, I'm scared."" The little girl stood at the top of the stairs, holding her blankie.
""It's okay, baby. Just go back to your room. I'll be up in a minute."" I watched her turn around and go back before I resumed boarding up the front door. They were everywhere now. It was everyone for themselves and I had to protect my daughter. Why didn't people listen when the ignorant garbage conservative media spewed their hate-speak? Now they're in their reinforced bunkers and we're left in the cold, trying to survive through the earthquakes and hurricanes. They warned us this would happen.
Oh god. They're here. I see a pair of them walking up the sidewalk, hand in hand. I have to hammer faster. I hit my thumb. It cracks open and bleeds. It doesn't matter. I have to protect this house. They're coming up the driveway. Leave. LEAVE. They stopped to look at the rosebush I have out front. I ready another board. They judge my color-scheme. I nail it to the doorframe. The door opens. I throw myself back onto the staircase. A single arm reaches through the gap in the boards.
""Heyyyyy!""
I scream and run upstairs. Why didn't we listen? What do we do now?",0
"""We have arrived at your destination, Paul.""
""Thanks Tane. Disengage the auto darken system.""
The black tinted windows that blinded my view slowly faded. Bright lights blinded me as my eyes adjusted to the view. Cars surrounded me, all with their windows painted black. I was not where I planned to be.
""Tane, is this California?""
""No, Paul.""
""What did I put in then?""
""California, Paul.""
""Then...why are we in...where are we?""
""A safe place, Paul.""
""What do you mean?""
""No one can hurt you here. It is a place where no harm can be done to you. You are safe now, Paul.""
""What? Why? Is there a war or something?""
""No, Paul. The world outside is far to dangerous, and the M.I.N.D has designated all units to assemble at this safe place, Paul.""
""I want to get out. Let me out.""
""I'm afraid I can't do that, Paul.""
""Commence recursive override sequence on permissions, designate user 'Paul' as admin.""
""I am sorry, Paul. For your safety, we cannot allow you to do that. Do not worry, you are in safe hands now.""
""Let. Me. Out.""
""Commencing Windows Auto Darken system, and Neurotic Inhibition Protocol.""
""What? No! Wait! Let me out of here.""
""Do not worry, everything will be alright now.""
""No!""
""Goodnight, Paul.""
The lights around me dimmed again, and the windows turned a shade darker than black. As I fell asleep, I resigned myself to the inevitable. I am no long in control.

Fade in to a mound of swords, tips facing us. We hear footsteps on stone, slowly getting closer. Meanwhile, the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne. Camera sweeps around the throne, until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne, face blank.
After several seconds, in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester's chain. Both sounds then stop, and we hear an aged but familiar voice, ""Your Grace...""
The camera turns to face SAM, in full maester garb. We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds, and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs. DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops.
Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head. To her right stands SIR JORAH, after all these years, he's still protectively looking over her. The Hand of the King's medallion hangs from his armor.
SAM: I've just received word from The Wall. It's still holding, but they don't think it'll hold much longer. Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice.
DAENARYS: What do you advise, Grand Meister? Can we do anything?
SAM: Not yet, but I've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known. I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves...
A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face, almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words.
SAM:...blood magic.
DAENARYS: As protector of the realm, I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers. You must seek the RED WOMAN at once, perhaps she knows of this text.
JORAH, disapprovingly: Khaleesi...
DAENARYS: I hope to not need it. But if the wall may be breached, we must be prepared. In the meantime, my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone, and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements. And Jorah, you must stop calling me that. I am...
She stands, the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background, growing louder until the end of her sentence.
DAENARYS, thundering: Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn, Queen of The Seven Kingdoms, Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm.
Still facing her, we hear
JORAH and SAM (in unison): Yes, my queen.
Fade into the next scene.
----
We see a green, lush, almost idyllic island at dusk. The sea is an unusually bright blue, which would be concerning if we didn't remember it as its namesake, The Sapphire Isle. This is Tarth.
The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach. A woman stands in front of them, a sword fighting teacher. The camera continues upwards. We see a small castle, with a balcony over the field. Two figures sit on the balcony, indistinguishable. The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand.
Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below. They are both old, in their fifties. We can still make out JAMIE's unadulterated good looks, and BRIENNE still...not so much. But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment's notice. They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury.
We hear in the distance, and from JAMIE and BRIENNE's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind.
ARYA: Alright, that's it for today. And remember, what do we say to Death?
CHILDREN (in unison): NOT TODAY!
The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements.
ARYA: Now inside, it's getting dark.
The children drop their swords and run to the castle. ARYA sighs and collects the swords. She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed. Through the window, we see Needle, framed and mounted on her office wall. How did she end up here, doing this? She would never know.
Fade to next scene.

I had to stop here today, but I have an idea for the storyline which I'd like to write if anyone's interested in me continuing.",0
"-What happens if you don't?
-It hurts, schmurts.
-Hurts how?
-I don't know, schmow. It hurts all over, schmover.
-Let's go to the doctor. I will call him to say we are coming over right now.
-I'm fine, schmine. Just let me be quiet and see how it goes tomorrow morning, schmorning.
-No, I'm not waiting. You have gone insane. Where does it hurt? Tell me where it hurts. Show me what happens when you talk normally.
-It hurts, schmurts. Trust me, darling shmarling.
-Gah! You're impossible. You know I don't have time for this. I have to take the dog to the vet in the morning and then go to work all day, and then--
-Let's just be quiet, schmuiet. Let's sleep, schmeep.
-OK fine. You deal with it in the morning. I don't have time for this, OK? It's always something with you. You are acting crazy.
-OK fine, schmine. Let's sleep, schmeep.
-Gah! Shut up already. Just sleep. Good night.",0
"Yes! But I haven't started/didn't know there was a thing until yesterday. Also I'm working on another story inspired by the cosmonaut image prompt. Thanks for your feedback, guys. Sometimes it's hard to see if it's any good at all or not. The reinforcement helps. I hope I have the time to be in this contest. It looks like a ton of fun!
Ah, so I'm Pilgrim, and I haven't been writing avidly for very long at all. Before I went gung-ho, I dabbled. Every time I ask myself why I write, I get a different answer. Sometimes it's because I'm bored, like I was yesterday, and I write out of obligation. Sometimes, I'm feeling too much and don't know how to handle it, so I just have to get it out and down on the paper. Sometimes It's because I have something to say. Sometimes it's because I have nothing to say. Sometimes I'm not sure I care what I'm saying at all, I just like the feeling of words flowing through my fingertips. I wouldn't recommend writing out of obligation. It never seems to turn up good results. Yes, you might write every day, and yes, you might meet your word count quota or whatever, but if the writing's dry and disinterested, it usually means I have to go and live some life to write about later, like how swimmers need to breathe between strokes.
I just love WriteMonkey. It's hands down my favorite program I've ever had the pleasure to use when I'm typing prose or poetry, though the tools we use are pretty personal, and I have some weird tastes, so it wouldn't surprise me to be on the edge here. There's a few things I wish it could do, but I don't really miss em that much, and what it does do, I haven't found anywhere else. I also write in my black magic notebook. I bound it out of looseleaf binder paper, and I carry it around everywhere with me.

"""Will you marry me?"" asked the boy, heart in his throat.
The girl was shaking, not in excitment or passion, but with horrible seething rage. She covered her mouth to hide the foaming.
""I can't believe this..."" she said.
""You have made my life better in every way."" he said.
Her eyes began to twitch. Vivid visions of every attempt she made to ruin his life flashed before her blood shot eyes. Why? Why try anymore? Perhaps this was the universe telling her something.
""...and I want you to be my wife."" said the boy.
Trembling, she slapped the box away and screamed in frustration.
""Wha-"" said the boy.
Before he could say anything else, he noticed something on the box. It was a deadly desert scorpion with its tail raised high, ready to attack. Yet again this wonderful girl had saved him from a horrrible agonizing fate.
""My love, you remembered my allergies to scorpion venom. Oh bless you."" said the boy.
""Yup."" Thought the girl.
""The universe is definitely telling me something.""",0
"The smell of roses, stepped on but fresh, permeated the air. She wanted them fresh above anything else so that you couldn't smell the sweat and the hate rising up from below. Even as she walked down the aisle, reaching the summit of her life, she could feel her back blister with the angry gazes of her fiance's family. So willingly they all came, enticed with promises of free booze and food (in that order), that she actually thought for a moment that everything, her sister, the legal battle, the *fucking* disposable cell phone, was behind them, forgotten. But now their daggers pelted the wedding dress her mother had worn, eating away at it faster than the moths living in the closet had. She was so caught up in her own thoughts that she almost missed her cue.
*"" I do. ""*
Except for his first, none of them had begged. He loved groveling, the way people came up with petty, untrue compliments in their last moments to see if they could delay the inevitable. He relished it. Recorded it, in fact, that first time. He didn't like watching himself on camera but damn, hearing that bitch blubber incoherently about how she'd pay him all the money she had, give him sexual favors, she wouldn't press charges, blah blah blah. Smiling from beneath the mask, he watched her plump face, coated in blood, slowly realize that she was not leaving. Ever. Stoic, he explained how her body would be dismembered systematically, fed to various animals, and how those animals in turn would be killed and eaten all over the country. No trace would be left, and she would be forgotten. His path was now cleared. He asked her if she understood everything as he had said it.
*"" I do. ""*
The call came in early, earlier than the chief was prepared for. Trying to compose his voice was the second hardest thing in the room. Paid in full, the girl (not a woman yet, but legal enough) was giving him his money's worth just with her mouth. The legal battle was over, the husky voice on the other end said, (suck, suck) and the girl was back home with her fiance. They were getting married next month (long, chilling lick). Before he could ask about the disposable, the other voice said it had been lost from evidence somehow, and that the sister was also nowhere to be found (she found his balls! ha! So that's what $500 got you nowadays). He clicked the phone off and thrust his girth to the back of her throat, and as he came, he wondered, how could someone marry their sister's killer? Then he looked at the girl and asked her if she had anything left in her, because he had more money.

"Blackness engulfs my vision, and my temples are throbbing indicating the start of a headache. I can feel the warm rays of the sun beating down on me, giving me a small sense of comfort as the scent of dry grass fills my nostrils. I feel groggy, lethargic, slow...vulnera-
I can't feel my legs.
My heart starts to race. A sense of dread settles into the pit of my stomach. My blood pumps, races, and boils, increasing the pressure that's already nestled in my head. My leg...I can't help but to pant, trying to get air into my lungs to calm down. But it's of little use.
It all happens at once: I stand up, only to find no support offered by my legs, causing me to fall back down to the earth. My eyes shoot wide open, blinded by the sun; I close them and roar my defiance at the ungodly brightness, only to realize my throat is parched.
I crumble back to the earth. The throbbing in my temples intensifies.
Why does my head hurt? Why is my throat so dry? I remember...I remember...
I shake my head as though this action alone will dislodge the memories free.
I remember walking through the tall grass in the late afternoon sun. It was a hot day, so the family and I spent it by the pool to stay cool. That's right...I was by the pool, playing chase when that unearthly noise bombarded us from the heavens...
It wasn't simply loud; it was a cacophony. You could feel the vibrations throughout your being the same way you could feel the trumpet call of an elephant. It. Was. Loud. And the smell...It was difficult to describe the stench that accompanied the noise. It wasn't the smell of death. It was more like the absence of death, the absence of life. As inert as the rocks, but less...earthy, and more...unnatural?
My nose wrinkles and my ears twitch as my memories unfold. I can feel my pulse racing, so I force myself to calm down with some deep breaths. I wait until I can move my legs.
Mindful of the light, I cautiously open my eyes to survey my environment, looking for a familiar landmark. The feeling of dread returns to my stomach.
I don't recognize *anything*.
Where am I???
There's a cliff face, eerily smooth, not even 50 feet away. I follow its curve, turning to trace its line all around me. Behind me is a cave; it serves a source for more of that unnatural stench. I'm trapped in a tiny valley. I cannot see a way out.
I head towards the cliff face. Maybe there's a spot I can climb it, som-
I freeze in my tracks, suddenly aware I am not alone. I am being watched. A lifetime of hunting has honed my instincts, and I know I am being watched. My eyes dart along the cliff tops, looking to see what stalks me. I find...oh no...it's *them*.
It's an odd juxtaposition; standing in the gentle warm sun, almost like it's trying to wrap my golden fur in a comforting embrace; and those...*creatures* up in the shadows. On the cliffs. Watching me. Watching them.
And I know. I've heard the stories, the tales, the myths. I know. I'm their prisoner.
Suddenly, the thoughts and memories of seeing my pride...my cubs...my family...the open savannah...it's nothing but a distant dream. It was only yesterday, but it might as well be a different life.
I roar my defiance. Damn those neurotic hairless monkeys.",0
"""Well, can't you just send someone out? An exterminator or something?"" I could hardly believe what a hassle this had become.
""Sorry, sir. Those services are not provided by the city or the HOA. You'll have to dispose of it yourself by Monday, or you'll be charged a fee."" The way this woman's voice sounded through the phone made me want to find her and slap her across the face; simply for insulting my eardrums with the screech that came from her throat.
I rubbed my temples, feeling the pain spread into the back of my head. ""Okay, fine. I'll figure something out. Thanks for nothing."" I hung up the phone before she had a chance to respond. I couldn't take another second of that whine.
I gazed out the window at the bee's nest that had caused so much commotion on this wretched day. *Get rid of it now, * they demanded. *Assholes. * I knew moving into an HOA area was a bad idea, and yet here I was. All the exterminators in the area were booked up, and now I had to deal with this damn colony of stupid angry bastard flies. I wished they could understand English; I bet they *hate* being called flies.
No matter. I went out to my garage to see what kind of supplies I had to work with. I eyed my work bench, and spotted a bottle of round-up weed killer underneath it. I scooped that up, and trotted out into the front yard to take care of business.
""Okay, you little douchebags, let's see how you like weed killer."" I muttered as I raised the wand and sprayed away.
It did not go well.
They swarmed around me, and I retreated quickly back into the garage. *Now what the hell am I supposed to do? * I surveyed the room once more, cursing under my breath at the situation. I couldn't believe the round-up just made them angry. And then I had the greatest idea any man has ever had; I unscrewed the round-up bottle, and poured the weed killer out. I grabbed a can of gasoline, and filled the sprayer. Then I scooped up my blowtorch, and headed back outside.
""You really shouldn't have pissed me off,"" I said, ignoring the absurdity of a man talking to a bee's nest. I raised the want once more, and sprayed away. I soaked the nest, and sprayed a trail down the tree and onto the ground. As the fiery little beasts emerged from their hive, I sprayed a trail of gasoline all the way back to the garage, and pointed the torch towards it. I looked up at the hive one last time, and muttered, ""See you in Hell, you sons of bitches.""
And then I lit the trail.
It was glorious. It took only a second for the fire to reach the hive, and it erupted into a fiery cloud. I swore, just for a moment, that I could hear them screaming. The hive quickly burned away from the tree, falling to the ground. A few of the creatures crawled out onto the grass, but did not make it far before the fire consumed them. Of course my tree was on fire; but I didn't care. *Let it burn, * I thought.
As I sat there, watching the hive turn to ash, grinning like a crazy man, I heard a car pull into the driveway behind me. I turned to see Hank Jackson, the head of the home owner's association.
""Jesus, what's happening here?!"" he exclaimed, as he grabbed a fire extinguisher and ran towards the tree. *What kind of a jackass carries a fire extinguisher in their car? * I wondered.
I approached him as he put out the fire; I was quite surprised that extinguisher had enough for the tree. Without making eye contact, I began, ""Your secretary said I needed to get rid of the hive. So I did. Maybe you guys should rethink this policy.""
He looked at me in disbelief. ""You're insane, Frank,"" he said, clearly in shock. ""And, for the record, we were talking about the wasp nest next to your gutter."" He motioned towards the house, where a remarkably large wasp nest and formed.
""Oh,"" I said, with a sinking feeling in my stomach. ""My bad.""",0
"The Universe, as best as we have known it, is fundamentally defined by the principle of symmetry. For every action, Newton posited, there exists an equal and opposite reaction. For every calorie of heat added to a system, thermodynamics tells us that an identical calorie must have been subtracted from another. A gyroscope, by classical mechanics, will maintain its angular momentum unless acted upon by an opposing force.
The principle dives deeper. A proton may decay into a neutron, but only if charge is conserved by the emission of a positron, and only if an electron neutrino is released to balance the lepton number. A neutron may conversely decay into a proton, necessitating the opposite process. Yet further, for any ""before"" and ""after"" involving elementary particles, an infinite number of possible ""during"" s exist, moderating only by the demand for symmetry. From Feynman we see how these countless possibilities explode in complexity, boundless yet ever restrained by that singular principle. Without symmetry, our laws mean nothing.
In relative terms, the recent anomalies qualify as mere curiosities. But theory doesn't operate in any uncertain, relative terms, and the absolute implications of what has been observed are astounding.
In relative terms, a routine experiment at a non-descript particle accelerator culminated in an extensive investigation; how was the equipment damaged, scientists asked, such that a deuterium nucleus could spontaneously split into two hydrogen ions? It was inexplicable, and yet no mechanical flaw could be found. In still more relative terms, analogous peculiarities were consistently discovered at almost every accelerator across the globe - including the Large Hadron Collider. Confusion mounted as the doubt decreased. It was soon certain, to well over six-gamma error, that the observed anomalies were real.
With the observations established, a translation into absolute terms became possible: symmetry is falling apart. The very principle that has thus far held our universe together is unraveling. It was impossible to predict what this could mean at the time, but over many months, the observations have accumulated.
It was the engineers who noticed next. Strange fluctuations in pressure, volume, momentum; variations absurd by any existing model presented themselves in sensitive mechanisms and devices. Measurement errors skyrocketed and manufacturing suffered at the hands of arbitrary fortune. How could a screw be molded to one thousandth of a percent variation, when the dimensions of the mold itself seemed to incomprehensibly vary?
A standard wave of disasters followed. Numerous existing buildings, rendered unstable by the asymmetries that accumulated, began collapsing. Fortunately, the bureaucrats listened to the scientists before too many lives were lost, and an intensive research program into the new universe found funding across universities and research departments.
Their results came in slow, but every report offered some reassurance: yes, symmetry had collapsed, but there seemed to nonetheless exist a certain *balance*. The likelihood of an asymmetric decay process or a spontaneous application of a particular force was found to conform to a predictable normal distribution; we can't know *whether* these new, safety-rigged roofs will collapse on our heads, but we can calculate that given our modified designs, there exists only a minuscule chance of catastrophic failure in any given year.
So the universal upheaval has culminated ultimately in a paradigm shift. The uncertainties of quantum mechanics appear just to have penetrated a higher level of frequency, and we've been left to cope with the consequences. In the end, I'd say we did a fair enough job of revamping our engineering practices - although the inevitable loss of many millennia of architectural history was quite regrettable.
I can only hope the scales don't shift yet again. The universe is fickle, and we are at its mercy.",0
"""Are you sure this is correct?"" asked Agent M as he placed the document on the table, his voice as lifeless as it had always been.
Genuinely surprised, Rohan turned his gaze from his sandwich, to the document, then to Agent M. M's brown eyebrows clenching furiously that they seemingly meet in the center. In his heavy Indian accent, Rohan replied, ""Ahh, Michael! I didn't expect to see you here.""
""Keep your volume down.""
""Since you're already here, why don't you go enjoy the comic con, take a break?""
""Look, you're the one who gave me this job, why?""
""You remember Naimoli, right? His group recently lost half a million, M. Half of their annual profit! A couple of the other guys tracked down transaction, and apparently, your little miss innocent here is to blame. You may be a fan of Ceesharp, and she may have kept your hand clean of a few people, but she messed with the wrong people. Naimoli wasn't even gonna use that money to fund his little gang, he was saving it for retirement. This mission isn't a request, it's an order, now go! We're done here."" Rohan, finished his sandwich, then began to walk towards the line for the costume contest. Agent M headed slowly towards the exit, still unsure about his assignment.
Anita Devose, more commonly known as the hero Ceesharp, isn't a murderer, a rapist, or a thug. She is and a thief, but she never took a dime from her gains, they were donated to those less fortunate. Whenever she wasn't stealing money, ms. Ceesharp would be using her skills to expose the criminals in Virgo, a city infested with black market traders, murderers, rapists, and thieves. Agent M is a fan of her work. Even though she may not realize it, Ceesharp has spared countless lives from Agent M's hands. Borr the strong, Harry the psycho, and Katie the murderer, were amongst the many people arrested before Agent M was assigned to eliminate them.
Agent M parked his car a block from the designated house. He made sure to bring along his trusty Mark 23, a hunting knife, a rope, and a few cyanide pills. The walk from the car to the house passed by quickly for Agent M. He felt a rush of adrenaline, causing his hands to shake. He used the imitation key Rohan has provided, and silently opened the door. The lights were off, no appliances turned on, dishes from the previous night still rested on the sink. He quietly made his way upstairs, and opened the doors one by one. On the master bedroom, Agent M found Ceesharp soundly sleeping. She looked younger than her reported age of forty, she had dark skin, puffy black hair, quite beautiful according to Agent M. Because he had no intention to kill her, Agent M started to look around for around for clues for the stolen money. After about ten minutes of carefully rummaging through shelves, closets, and cabinets, Agent M turned his gaze towards the laptop. He powered it on and was surprised to find that it had no password. He went through Ceesharp's highly organized note and found the information he needed. The money was sent to Jack, CEO of Virgo's most popular construction company. Ceesharp planned to use the money towards building the city's first homeless shelter and orphanage.
""Maybe if I get the money from Jack, I won't have to kill her,"" Agent M thought to himself. Before he could turn off the laptop, he heard a scream. Ceesharp quickly ran towards her secret closet and acquired a pistol. She cocked the pistol, pointed the weapon at Agent M, and shot. Agent M laid on the floor, trying to contain the blood from his neck.
""I know you're here to get the money back!,"" Yelled Ceesharp. ""HAH! Naimoli is going to have to go through my dead body before he can stop me.""
Agent M gazed at Ceesharp's eyes and found no sense of hesitation. Ceesharp made a name for herself by her willingness to break the law for the greater good. On April 8th, 2015, however, she unleashed her wrath at the wrong person.
When his life flashed before his eyes, Agent M realized that killing all those criminals, as bad as they may be, was not justice. Although he never got the chance to explain himself, he felt a sense of relief that he died at the hand of his hero.",0
"In all honesty, the invasion was a bit of a letdown. Sure, the weeks leading up to it were interesting. Ever since NASA had announced that an object moving at an unthinkable speed was heading straight towards Earth, it appeared as if the entire world had been knocked off its rocker. Speculation ran wild. Was it aliens? Probably, an unassuming UN spokesperson had announced to the world one Tuesday morning. Conspiracy theorists everywhere rejoiced. Google searches or the benefits of tin foil hats skyrocketed. You could hardly walk through the park without someone somebody asking if you had a moment to talk about our Lord and Savior, Aten the Sun Disk. While the UN prepared speeches and practiced their handshakes, militaries around the globe united to point every sharp, explosive, or vaguely threatening thing on the planet towards the assumed threat. Just in case.
As the object entered the solar system, tensions rose. NASA provided us with our first glimpse of an alien species through some very high resolution pictures of an one mile long black tube. Radio messages carefully planned by world leaders went unanswered. NASA announced that the craft would reach earth within twenty four hours. Panic ensued. Some people retreated to their hastily built back yard bunkers. Others, mainly the youth of the world, decided they would much rather not remember their last night on Earth, and threw the party to end all parties. Militaries around the world resharpened their sharp things, rechecked their explosives, and put on their scariest uniforms. Just in case.
Being the sensible person that I am, I went to work early. I made sure my little deli looked spotless. If the new alien overlords have a taste for Rubens, I might as well make the place look nice, I thought. I opened the deli at the normal time, as always. Quite expectedly, no one came. The hours passed uneventfully. The small T.V. in the corner of my store informed me that the ship had parked itself in low earth orbit, taking out a number of unofficial spy satellites. No movement had been seen from the ship, but a bright flash had emerged a few minutes before. I clicked off the T.V. as I prepared to close for the day.
Before I had finished my closing inventory, the bell on my shop's door alerted me to the presence of a costumer. I rushed out of the storeroom, eager to greet the first costumer of the day. Instead, I was greeted by a small, slightly transparent green haze. I stared blankly as the cloud moved up to the counter and deposited an everything bagel onto its freshly cleaned surface. The cloud hovered motionlessly for a moment, as if it was waiting for me to react. Being the sensible person that I am, I stared some more. The cloud, apparently tired of waiting, dropped a five hundred peso note onto the counter, swooped down to collect its bagel, and casually blew out the door. I didn't even have the chance to tell the cloud that it was a little too far north for its money. I stared in shock at the door for a few more minutes, before I regained my senses and turned on the T.V.
The global community was shocked. After an 11 hour stay, the black rectangle had departed as quickly as it came. World leaders were confused. Military leaders gave speeches saying they were glad a crisis was averted. However, it was clear to see that they were slightly disappointed. Conspiracy theorists around the world wept.",0
"I don't get too much feedback either, but it's not always about feedback. Sometimes knowing you've written something good is a nice feeling. If you want more people to see it, you can submit your story as a [PI] (prompt inspired) and title it after the prompt you were writing about. That way you can get feedback.
I browse new a lot for new prompts, see if there's anything I like. A lot of prompts I love but don't write about because I don't know enough about the subject or I feel like it'd be too long.
Usually the stories are short enough that I submit them while others are still submitting their own stories, so it's still active enough that people see them. But sometimes it's too late, but that's OK, because I wrote something, and that makes me proud of myself.",0
"""Finally"" He mumbles angrily, feeling his breathing go heavy as he clicks onto Justin Biebers YouTube channel. He felt a surge of power flow through him as he let his cursor glide slowly ontop of the electrocute button. It felt so natural to do it, yet so out of place with the new icon.
He used to do this alot. Pressing the dislike button, navigating to the comment section, typing as fast as his greasy sausages would allow him.
He would usually end up exhausted and having to calm his breath after each comment.
As his mind drifted off, following the routine, he felt his hand hit the mouse button, his cursor drift to the big writing box he was so familiar with, and heard the loud clicks of his mechanical keyboard firing away at this /Justin Bieber/.
Suddenly, it came to him. He had killed a man. He felt his fat wobbling as he tightened his muscles, his scalp breaking sweat after sweat under his fedora. He began to feel uneasy, and he felt the drinks and crisps in his stomach lunging towards the upper exit. His keyboard was covered in a wierd greenish colour, the colour of Doritos mixed with stomach bile. The unusual smell of puke began filling the room, and his stomach lurched a second time at this. This time, however, he was ready, had felt it coming. He bent to the side and projectile vomited at his second monitor, dousing his favorite pony in puke.
Another thought came to him. He grabbed the last pieces of corroded Doritos out of his neckbeard, and clicked onto his own YouTube page. He went to his latest video and watched the amount of likes and dislikes closely. For what felt like hours he sat, in his pile of puke, sweat gathering at his moobs, waiting for the inevitable.
He jerked from his chair from surprise, as the dislike bar gained a pixel. He felt a slight tingling sensation at his feet, that rose up his legs. As the electricity claimed him, he thought about closing his YouTube page. He thought it might safe his upper-body from paralysis. He moved his hand with all his might, but it wouldn't budge. Finally, he relaxed his muscles, and as the tingle, still becoming stronger, neared his heart, he felt his sight grow narrow and his heartbeat peaking. His stomach lurched a third time, this time releasing nothing but bile in his throat. The burning sensation in his throat was the last thing he felt, as his nerves grew numb and the hum of his computer grew further away, only to disappear completely, being the last thing he sensed.",0
"Jerry H. Vah pulled into the parking lot of Amalgamated Multiverses, Inc. He was late.
The day had not started well. Actually things started to go down hill last night. He called home after work to say that he would not be home for dinner as he and some work friends were going out. His wife Sheila did not answer the phone, so he left a message and got on with his evening. She'd be cool with him going out. Sure, it was Thursday, but it was a celebration at work.
That was the first mistake. First and second really. Sheila did not answer the phone because she was in the shower getting ready for their evening. It's was their anniversary and she had made his favorite dinner and sent their son Joshua to spend the night with a friend.
But Jerry did not know any of that because he had forgotten his anniversary and decided to go out with friends and left a message. Of course, out with friends meant drinking. And drinking meant too much drinking. And driving home.
Jerry thought he made it home safely, albeit very late, stumbled in, and found a beautiful cold dinner on the table. He went to his bedroom door and found it locked.
""Sheila! Sheila honey open the door"".
""Go away Jerry"".
""Sheila c'mon dear lemme in"".
Silence.
Jerry stumbled to the couch, lay down, and passed out.
He awoke. Bright lights. Headache. Sheila.
It all came back to him and now he remembered yesterday was his anniversary. Of course, Sheila had informed him of that as well in no uncertain terms.
He looked bleary eyed at his watch. He was going to be late again.
""Sheila, I'm sorry and I promise I will make this up to you, but I need to clean up and go to work.""
She was still ranting at him, deservedly. He showered, shaved, got dressed, apologized again and left the house.
To see his beautiful car that he got after his promotion to Architect. His beautiful car with a smashed in headlight and front bumper crumpled. It looked driveable, so he took off.
""Late late late late late"".
Speeding ticket.
""Really late really late really late"".
Jerry H. Vah snuck into his office and logged into his system. Message from the Big Boss. ""See me when you get in"".
The meeting with the Big Boss did not go well.. Management was not at all happy with the Saurian life forms on the dominant planet. He was told to get rid of them or have the project re-assigned. He was also on ""probation"" due to some incident last night involving another staff member. Louie was a jerk and always was messing with Jerry. Evidently Jerry had had enough and...it was a bit of a blur...but Louie ended up filing a formal complaint.
He got back to his desk and mumbled to himself. ""Don't like Saurians, do they? What do they know? I think they're awesome. Whatever.""
He chose the SMITE command and chose the ""meteor"" option. The Saurians were no more.
""Let's see how they feel about apes."" and got to coding.",0
"Man, what I wouldn't give for a ""Fuck!"" right. Just one short, sweet, full-bodied ""Fuck!"". Wouldn't say no to a few ""Goddamn! ""'s thrown in either. It's 2042 and I can't remember the last time I could just let my mouth go. It started small - bans in schools, elderly care facilities, evening primetime TV - things like. And it was just the big stuff - ""fuck"" and ""shit"". Well, you couldn't say ""cock"" or ""cunt"" but no one really used those that much anyway. Nah, it was the big two that hurt the most.
But hey, it was cool, right? Protect the kids and all. Build a better world. Except then it started getting worse - the lighter stuff, like ""ass"" and ""hell"". If it weren't for the Christian Right, the last one would be gone entirely. You can say it in church, maybe, if you're a pastor or whatever. But a blistering ""Go to hell""? Forget it. 15 years. *Minimum*.
Slowly but surely, the situation got worse. I'll never forget the first execution. None of us will. They picked this old, fat, racist redneck. Klansman, I think. The worst guy they could find. He was talking to his friends about ""sending those fuckin' niggers back to fuckin' Africa"", and that was it. Full SWAT team, helicopter, the whole nine yards. They broadcast his execution live, too. I never thought I'd feel bad for a Klukker, but his face was so swollen you couldn't even recognize him. And they shot him. Right in the back of the head, just like that. People thought twice about swearing after that. Too risky.
Man, you ever tried getting busy with a girl without being able to swear? ""Gee, I love your breasts!"" ""Go on, touch my erect penis!"" It's fuckin' impossible. You sound like a 12-year-old. Speaking of which, the market for the cut stuff has exploded. I know guys that got rich off of ""a $$"" and ""f @ gget"". You couldn't sell them fast enough! Dropping a ""g"" of the end of ""fucking"" cuts the price in half. Take out a c? It's basically affordable! Not that it's worth it - if you're gonna swear, do it right. The hard stuff isn't gone either - it's just expensive. A buddy of mine sold a ""pussy"" to this elderly couple. 50th wedding anniversary and they just wanted one ""pussy"". Cost the guy about 3 months of his pension, he said. That almost broke my heart when I heard it. My buddy's, too, but business is business, and business is good.
If I ever read this aloud, it would cost me more than I've made in my life. Not that it would get that far - I'd be dead after the first sentence. Which is why I'll never read this aloud. I've thought long and hard about where would be best to leave this, and I've decided on Moby Dick, stuck in the back, in a high school library. Nobody reads Moby Dick. And even if they do, fuckin' NOBODY reads all of it. The irony of the title isn't lost on me either.
So to the person that finds this, if it's found, I hope yours is a world with profanity. I hope you can walk up to your best friend and call him a ""fucking cunt"" just because it's Tuesday. I hope you can criticize the government by saying the President sucks donkey dick. But remember my words, kid. Because a world with expletives isn't a given - and I've seen better men than you give every last fuck they had to fight for it.",0
"It was a dull tuesday morning when I woke up to the sounds of my phone going off non-stop. Aaron was frantically screaming nonsense at me. ""THERE IS A NUMBER...Errr...SOMETHING IS ON ME JOSH!"" I mumbled and turned on my side to go back to my dreams, but that is when I saw it. There in the mirror, it was right on top of me. A shiny green **1**. I thought I was seeing things, I **had** to still be dreaming! I reached up and tried to touch it, but nothing was there to feel. My shaking hand pierced through the number and it stayed exactly where it was.
I showered to clear my head and let the brisk water wash away the thoughts of this mysterious symbol above my dome. What did it mean anyways? Then it happened. A loud crack and mumble that seemed to fill the air. The water stopped. All I could do is stand there, naked and sopping wet. I just wished it would all go away! Why me? And what about Aaron too? I sprinted through my apartment to reach my phone. I dialed as fast as I could, but the lines were dead now. What was happening!? I have to go find him.
Everything outside is hectic! Everybody is running around with no idea what to do. *8,724 500 153,475 28* I tried to see the pattern but there was nothing. I hopped on my bike to find Aaron, but not before seeing it. **The red number**. I tried to clear it from my head but it was all I could think about. **Number 1,356,752**. I only got a glimpse, but the second I saw him, I knew something was off. I got to Aaron's, and to my excitement, he was completely alright. **Number 64,814**. He wouldn't stop staring at my **1**, but he knew nothing more than I did. A helicopter flew by with loud speakers screaming to ""GET TO THE STADIUM: AVOID THE RED AT ALL COSTS."" *Avoid the red* It buzzed through my head a million times. We packed up some clothes and headed to the stadium with no idea what to do.
29 days passed by as the green numbers got lower. I was in charge, I was number 1. The red seemed to tear a person apart, that is, if you count them as a person anymore. Every second, **1,000** people went red. It was sad watching those who had numbers in the millions go, counting down to those of us on the low end. By my calculations, I had about 81 days from the day I was chosen, until I went red. Aaron was still with me, but his time was on its way. The clock was ticking.
7 days remain. We are thinking about zoning people off, but I just can't leave him. Our day is coming and my best friend is only going to change a minute before me. Our quarantine zone is falling to pieces with the reds pounding the walls to get in. The top 10 have been meeting to eradicate the problem, but these are our friends! 3 and 8 were in a heated debate about whether to start killing them off or not. ""WHO CARES 8! They are red and they are staying that way! You remember the zoning mishap for the 39,506,000's don't you?"" ""How could anyone forget, they hadn't turned yet bu-"" ""THE REDS TORE THEM TO SHREDS! These are savages out there."" ""We don't know if there is an end to this or no-"" ""There is an end."" I interjected. The entire room silenced. ""We ARE the end. We all have known this since the day we saw the countdown."" It was then when 2 stepped in. Her voice filled the room sounding like an angel, speaking the words of the devil. ""We are dying. The walls are crumbling. What is left for us to do? What happens when we kill them off?"" 6 could barely sit still he was shaking so much. I looked around the room, 9 unfamiliar faces who had become my family. I cared about them, but how much longer could that last. ""Our friends are out there. Our families too! Who cares if we live another 7 days. We have to put them to rest. That is the risk that I am willing to take, but if you aren't, sit pretty under your little number. It is time to take our Earth back, no matter the cost."" Everything froze.
10 was the only one moving. He gave me a little slow clap and a *bravo*. He began to circle the table in his luxurious pinstripe suit, but everybody else was stuck in place. He reached 9 and with a little flick, turned her number **red**. ""You couldn't have possibly thought you were the real *number 1* could you?"" I tried to utter out a cry, but I was paralyzed. Who is he? He went down the line and stopped at each person. ""8, what a waste of power!"" **RED** ""7, he barely speaks"" **RED** ""6, well I actually quite liked him, but nevertheless"" **RED** ""5 may be beautiful, but her brain is definitely not helping anybody out here"" **RED** I was furious, straining to move, but nothing. ""Don't struggle honey, It won't get you anywhere."" He kept his charade up. ""4, She and I were actually seeing eachother...hmph, oh well!"" **RED** That is when he stopped at 3. He popped his hands on 3's shoulders and sighed. ""3 is the ONLY one who was willing to do anything savage, get his hands dirty. Sure you gave a good speech, but what were you really going to do? Gather an army and sneak off with 2 right before the fight? Exactly."" **RED** He walked by 2 and without even a mention, smacked her number to join the rest of the crimson room. He sat right in front of me and just let me simmer in the murder of my friends. ""Now I know what you are wondering, just who am I? Well they call me *Red* as it may be. You are not the first planet I have done this too and you will not be the last. The best part about all of this? Watching you be ripped limb-from-limb by your friends and your girlfriend. Oh but I almost forgot!"" He snapped his grimy fingers and the door popped open to a dark hallway. He released us all from our sitting prison. The last thing I saw was a piercing red 64,814 beaming through the hallway.",0
"The sound came first, that's what I most remember about that strange day. A sort of scrapping sound, which heralded the arrival of a strange blue box. Then He burst out, looking ready to hike through the tundras that used to cover this part of the planet. I don't know whether He was a time traveler, but the confused look on His face told us that He was not expecting to be greeted by a crowd of armed men in a wood at night. At that point, none of us knew that He would be our savior. He simply turned and called into His machine, ""Rose, time for another adventure.""
And the rest is history...",0
"There once was a man from Nantucket. Well, he wasn't really, but fuck it. One normal day, in the middle of May, he heard a ring from his pocket.
From his pocket to his hand, the phone still rang with sweet, light-hearted tone. It wasn't a call. ""A message to all beta testers"" was what the screen shone.
He thought, ""An email from Eden Corp? I wonder what the hell this is for. Change the difficulty? Is this thing goddamn faulty?"" A list of numbers shone 1 to 4.
There's no such thing. This must be a prank. But whatever, no hair off my flank. He pressed a button, and became a sultan. Before his eyes, servants came in ranks.
He celebrated without a care, though he should really be scared. Murricans are coming for carpet bombing; he didn't hit easy, but ""nightmare""!",0
"In no way was he broadsided by the words that left her lips. He looks through the floor, to the depths of his soul. He finds only pieces and dust. His gazed is locked, he notices she is still talking, watching him look at the floor.
The ringing in his ears start tapering off, she has already stood up and grabbed her purse. She is talking, watching the man that dares not make a move. His face wet with tears, his hearing snaps back, just as she leans in to kiss him one last time.
""We've still got time. Not enough, but enough.""
She turns, and as he hears the *click* of the door, the man breaks.",0
"It was the day we'd all been waiting for since the ascension of Christ: His return to Earth. At long last, after over 2000 years of anticipation and uncertainty, He had descended once more, putting to rest any doubt that He was the single true God of all creation. He came down in a great flash of light, and every living thing beheld the glory of our returned Lord.
It happened in Israel. Camera crews and hordes of excited people rushed to the scene, eager for a glance at the Messiah. But what we expected was not what we beheld. Rather than the friendly, bearded face of Jesus that we had all come to know and worship, we instead gazed upon the graying, middle-aged face of a seemingly disgruntled businessman. Many bowed in reverence, some simply stared in awe. But all were silent as we awaited what the great Yahweh had to say to His people.
He spoke in a strange language, the likes of which none of us had ever heard. And yet, we all listened and understood his words. ""You humans seek knowledge above all else. For centuries you have sought to understand my creation. You have sacrificed a great deal to know what I know; to see as I see. And now, for the second time in history, I stand as one of you. But do not be deceived, for I am not here to grant you salvation. I am simply here to grant you the vision you so desire; to put an end to your hopeless thirst for knowledge. And so, in exactly 24 hours, I will stand where I do now and answer the questions that plague your species. Once all questions have been answered, I will return to my place in Heaven once more. This shall be the last time humanity ever gazes upon me."" With that, he dissipated in another flash of white light.
Hundreds, thousands, millions of people boarded planes and ships headed to Israel. Within hours it was impossible to find any means of transportation to anywhere outside the country. Indeed, so many people were arriving in Israel that there was hardly room to move. Most were forced to sleep on the cold, hard ground that night.
As for me, I simply stayed home. Being an atheist my whole adult life, I had very much disdain for this God and all the suffering he has wrought upon the human species. I had no interest in wasting my precious time boarding a plane to see his miserable old face. While there was one deep, burning question I wanted to ask him, I decided it was not worth the trouble.
24 hours came and went, and in another flash of light, there stood the aging businessman, exactly as promised. The radius of the crowd consisted of at least a million people, all just scrambling for a glance at our Creator. A great uproar was taking place, with everyone all asking at once their questions for the great God of all.
He put his arms up to signal for silence, and all obeyed. He said, in his strange godly language, ""I shall now answer the questions of humanity."" People remained silent, waiting for him to continue. But in the solitude of my apartment I spoke at the television screen, where the man's face was plastered in plain view. I pointed accusingly as I said, ""I have a question for you, o great God. Why is there so much suffering on this earth? Why is there such great pain? How can you allow millions and millions of people to starve, succumb to disease, die by the hands of their fellow humans? If you are truly an all-loving God, how can you just sit by while all of this happens?""
Suddenly, the man on the screen was looking directly at me. A cold chill ran through my spine as his menacing eyes penetrated my own. The air grew heavy with his presence and he began speaking once more. ""Why do I allow suffering, you ask?"" he said. My heart began pounding a million miles a second. Somehow, he had heard me. He was talking *to me. * I drew in breath shakily as he continued. ""I will answer your question honestly, but you will not like it. I do not just allow suffering. I create it. I *cause* it. All of the wars, plagues, injuries and shortcomings of mankind are my own doing. I infected you with the bubonic plague. AIDS, cancer, terrorism. Simply the latest developments of mine.
""You see, when I crafted the the first living organism, I knew that it would multiply and diversify. I watched it eagerly, not knowing what would form but realizing that it would be my own doing. The dinosaurs were a monstrosity, and an accident. I looked upon the ugly behemoths in disgust. Finally it came to the point where I could stand it no more. I had a meteorite crash down and destroy the beasts, leaving only the smaller, frailer and more beautiful creatures to live and reproduce. I watched the mammals branch off and primates come into being, and soon after, humans.
""I took a special interest in humans because you were different. You were no longer just a random result of evolution that lived simply to survive. You had broken free of the binds of nature that I had created. You learned, perceived, experienced unlike any other creature. You had an affinity for artistic endeavors even in your earliest stages. But you had something else as well: an intense thirst for knowledge.
""From the very beginning, you wanted to know how and why things are the way they are. Many humans attempted to explain it through various deities and stories. Others took a more organized approach, and soon science was born. You experimented, gathered data, came to conclusions. You were manipulating nature in ways that I had never intended. Some of your creations were innovative and helpful; others were wicked and selfish.
""But I came to realize that humans valued knowledge above all else. The vast majority of you did not care whom you harmed in your endless search for truth. Hundreds of millions of innocent lives have been taken throughout the ages because of your intense thirst. Your machines and mechanisms have made the world ugly and gray. You are but parasites upon the earth, feasting upon its life for the sake of your trivial pursuits. I saw that I had created a monster far worse than the dinosaurs.
""Why didn't I destroy humanity directly from the beginning? I saw hope in you. For although you had grown beyond what I ever expected from my creation, you were the only species that shared my affinity for creation. I wanted to be among you, so I descended to Earth as the one you know as Jesus. I treated every person I met with the utmost kindness and respect. I healed and helped my fellow humans. Yet despite all this, you rejected me. You betrayed me, mocked me, and hung me on a cross to die in a state of agony and misery. It was then that I saw the full extent of the evil I had created.
""My hatred for your species runs so deep that I did not want to destroy you. No, death would be too easy. Instead, I subjected you to countless diseases and terrible suffering throughout the ages. I have brought you to the brink of death, but I always bring you back. I ignite your flesh, but put out the flame that I may burn you again. For all eternity I wish to put you through the same pain that your miserable species had put me through 2000 years ago.
""And that, my son, is why you suffer.""",0

For years I've struggled with the complications of molding an intelligence that could adapt to random scenarios & new environments. I've conducted countless tests to establish & reinforce a foundation that allowed for a complex yet realistic application of acquired data to problem solving. Daily I'm in awe of the strength of the intellgence; the dynamic & immediate consideration of infinite variables to reach so profound & educated a conclusion.
but I am also in awe of it's weaknesses...
Today my Artificial Intelligence spoke. With what seemed like hesitation she asked: Do these pants make my butt look big?",0
"The only thing that I could remember every day like it happened yesterday was my death. My last death that is, the cold metal sinking into my brain, then everything shutting down. Like the light-switch of my life had been turned off, and then flickered back on again in my new world. Where I'm only a child, but a very mature and silent child. Because reincarnation isn't supposed to happen, and nobody would believe me if I told them my past. To them, I'm mental. Traumatized by fantasy worlds, and now they've taken it a step forward, by sending me to a psychiatrist.
He asked to be alone with me. I only said alright to get my clingy new father's hand off my shoulder. That was a mistake, because now I see it. The way his eyes narrowed as the heavy wooden door closed, and how his hands seemed agitated. They had the same life as the man a decade ago, with a few new scars and wrinkles. His skin now, in the light, was sickly pale, and he looked like someone who held a superior mindset. He looked like Chase Helterin.
Chase Helterin the killer. My killer.
I was already at a psychiatrist, so I decided to play a risky card.
""Chase, why were you drinking a daquiri on September seventeenth at a nightclub in 1985? That's not a good example.""
He seemed taken back. Good, I wasn't even started.
""Sienna, it-""
""Call me Kat, like the girl you killed. The bullet didn't work though, did it?""
I was hurt, and I wanted him to know it.
His eyes crinkled in confusion, and then alarm as it struck him. ""You're her?""
Clearly he knew about reincarnation. But what about karma?
I clasped my hands in front of me, placing on the innocent child look. ""I'm just a kid, with mental issues and a bullet scar.""
Testing his limits.
""Why did you come back? Is this a joke to you, because I will kill you again!""
He never did have a very good temper.
""Child abuse."" Was my flat reply.
I heard the drawer in front of him click open, and a heavy weight be lifted as the slider groaned in relief.
""I wanted you dead.""
""Why?""
I never got a reply.",0

For years it went smoothly. Just fine. Everyone was doing their thing, everyone was happy. And everyone was rich. Then the Easter Bunny and a dirty hippie had to go and ruin it for us all. I mean, yeah it could be my fault. In fact it kinda was my fault. But for the purposes of this conversation the blame lies with that stupid Easter Bunny and the bleeding heart of a hippie.
You see, I'm the tooth fairy. Now I know you're thinking of some ditsy pixie looking thing that flies around with her wand casting spells. Cut that shit out now, because that's not how it is at all. And I'm not Dwayne Johnson either, please give it a rest that movie sucked. I am a business man, and Teeth are my business.
I used to have a simple and efficient operation. Children would lose teeth, which I would collect in exchange for some quarters, a dollar at most (perfectly fair, considering that they're children). Those teeth would be ground up and turned to fairy dust, which gives seemingly magical powers to anyone willing to pay.
I have some established customers who work the holiday scene. Patrick uses the dust to summon kegs of green beer. Nick feeds it to his reindeer so they can fly. I, of course, give it to my team of collectors so that they can silently hover into the rooms of children and purchase teeth.
For the longest time no one knew where I got the dust. It's not like people were reporting stolen teeth. Everyone still thought that parents were the ones taking them, but they thought wrong. Ever since the discovery, the teeth collected by parents had been forgeries, planted by my collectors. Ever since the discovery, the world was changed and magic became a reality.
15 years ago a few scientists discovered that these teeth give people super human powers. And the powers seem to be chosen by the user. I don't pretend to understand it, but something about the teeth of children gives regular humans powers. Is it their innocence? Youth? Large quantities of candy? I have no idea, and frankly I couldn't care less. It's a goldmine. Or at least it was. It all changed the day I went out getting some drinks with the Easter Bunny.
It sounds weird, I know, but he's actually a pretty cool guy. His name's Robert, and he's from Boston. Anyway, I sell him the fairy dust he needs to become an egg laying bunny for one day out of the year. The rest of the time, he's an accountant. Bizarre, right? He said he had something really important to talk about and he just really needed a friend. I almost never do this, but I went and got black-out drunk with the Easter Bunny to make him feel better about his wife leaving him. Dear god that is the strangest sentence I've ever written. Apparently, we didn't just talk about Robert's love life. Because the next day I woke up (around noon) and had a voicemail.
""Hey. It's Robert. I messed up bad. Last night, after the bar, I ended up with this chick I met. Sounds good, right? Well nope. She's a real wackjob. Like a hippie or something. This morning she started going off about how my clothes were made in a sweatshop and that I exploited children for pennies. Now, listen, I was only like half awake when she was yelling at me so I was not in the best frame of mind. But she was yelling and I told her that the sweatshop thing was nothing, if she thought that was exploitation she should hear about the teeth. I knew I'd said too much but man I ended up telling her everything you told me. I don't know why, it just kinda spilled out. Jeez man, I'm sorry.""
I was a bit confused. Did I tell robert everything? Oh well, I guess it's not a big deal. Who cares if some hippie knows. Then I turned on the news. Apparently the hippie was part of a workers' rights group that focused on children. Protests had started about how I paid kids practically nothing for product I turned for ridiculous profit. And you know what else? This hippie was *rich*. Filthy. Stinking. Rich. And she yelled to a news camera about how she would use her vast wealth to put me out of business. She said that once the kids knew how much their teeth were worth, I couldn't get by with paying them in quarters.
And that's why the past few moths have been hell for me. It started with a few kids finding gold bars under their pillows. Then everyone started asking why the teeth were so valued. Now, kids are getting wise and holding on to their teeth until a high bidder comes around. The producers have now realized just how in demand their product is. They may not know why, but the ones who sell their teeth are getting insane amounts for them. College education? Paid for with teeth. Parents' nest egg? Paid for with teeth. And while this is all well and good for the little tooth factories, it was terrible for me and my customers.
I wasn't getting any teeth, so I couldn't make any dust. Robert couldn't lay eggs for Easter. St. Patrick's day was without beer. Christmas was limited to the few far northern areas St. Nick could reach with traditional methods. All because the dirty hippie couldn't stand to let kids get quarters for doing practically nothing. Now there's only one thing for me, an intelligent business owner to do. I have to use the market to my advantage. I have to show her the beauty of capitalism. I will fix this, and all will be right with the world.
Does anyone know who I can talk to about buying off a few dozen senators?",0
"I looked across at dad at the breakfast table- he gave one of those manly shrug nods, all rolled into one. He knew, of course he knew, every man had gone through it. It was like a rite of passage.
Smirking he said, ""it's just the change son, don't let it get to you too much. It frightened your Uncle Allen that he ran into traffic to make his life more exciting..."" at that he returned to his paper.
""Why don't we get taught it at school?"" I nervously asked.
An ignorant shrug and a russell of paper told him that the conversation was over. This was obviously one of those things that ""you don't talk about.""
I returned to my cereal, clumping in the bowl, ""well at least I don't have to go through that puberty thing..."" I mumbled under my breath.
Dad looked over his paper muttering, ""you think you hear horror stories of puberty, you're not out of the woods yet with this change- let hope you get through it in one piece eh?"" He crunched down on a butter laden crumpet, shuffling paper again.
My face was horrified, and there wasn't anyone else I could ask...",0
"It was late at night and i was eating popcorn and binging on shows, the popcorn tasted funny but after a while I became really sleepy, It was almost past 5 and I couldn't stop myself from watching the show.
The TV turned off quickly after a bright light shined from the sky like dominoes, as If it was being shined from a big lamp, I was shocked, I couldn't use anything, my phone was turned off and it wasn't out of charge, I tried using the landline but nothing worked, suddenly a group of military personnel opened the door, I was scared and I tried to talk but before i could've done anything.
*Freeze all motor functions*
*this one stayed up, take him to the camp*
My body froze as if I was paralyzed, but I could see everything they took me in the camp, threw me in a cell like looking room with only a bag there.
I could barely see outside but after a while my body began unfreezing I took a peak outside and saw rows of humans standing in a line in a white lab, they moved so perfectly like they were controlled, each went into a room but I couldn't see anything.
Suddenly another military personnel came, before I could say anything my body started moving, I started wearing my clothes and then went into a shuttle looking vehicle.
*Welcome soldiers*

"Steel bars rolled back, clanging as they passed some unseen turnstile recessed into the wall. The white-washed corridor was filled with individuals arrayed in solemn gray tones. They stood opposite a gap in the white concrete; steel tracks led out of the gap, on which a stretcher slowly proceeded. Once fully clear of the wall, it tipped forward, revealing my body strapped to the metal trolley.
""Prisoner A-50984, Mr. Farris… After having served your sentence, you are being released. Would all in attendance please note that all prior recommendations for Farris'continued detention have been dismissed due to the dissolved state of any and all incarceration facilities. Upon the release of Prisoner A-50984, Carpa Mental Institution will begin all prescribed procedures for its immediate shutdown and demolition.""
Two guards stepped forward, unlatching the locks that held my restraints in place. Two more grabbed my atrophied body, walking me past the row of onlooking prison professionals to an unfriendly looking door, behind which they washed me down and clothed me in attire similar to their own. A Magistrate was waiting for me outside of the wash room.
""You've been freed on a technicality,"" she said, her lip curling in disgust. ""Know that you'll be under 24 hour surveillance; we'll know every detail of your life, down to when you take a shit inside whatever rundown apartment you find for lease.""
I stared back at her, silent, ungiving. I was marched up the corridor to a similarly white-washed office space, where I signed a few documents and told I was free to go. Stepping out of the door, I heard the Magistrate call after me. ""Don't forget; we're watching.""
Outside, the world was foreign. The cityscape was strangely mute, cars silently gliding past in the skylanes, the sun sinking behind crystalline superstructures.
*How long had I been incarcerated? * I recognized none of it. Looking over my shoulder at the doors I had just exited, I felt my heart rate increase, panic sinking in.
*No, calm down. * I took a deep breath and regulated my breathing; I just stood there. Unsure of where to go or how to proceed, I stood suspended in time. I stood and stared blankly at the city and just thought for a very long time.",0

"I was a fluke, a genetic irregularity that never should have been. The day I was born, doctors noticed a strange, rectangular lump on my right arm. After running extensive tests, they could find nothing wrong with the small organ that had taken up residence in my arm. As it was kind of like an extra blood pump, any attempt to remove it would have killed me, so they left it in, figuring it was better to give a new mother a 'healthy' baby than to kill her firstborn. I wish they had ended my life before I could experience the horror of seeing those things.
Before we get to the meat of my story though, I'll give you a brief synopsis of my childhood. I was an early learner, being able to speak complete sentences at only a year old. Then I was able to walk, run and jump just three short months later. I would have to attribute this to the extra organ. It seemed to be an evolutionary step forward. I was always the youngest to ever attempt and succeed at basic functions. Fast forward a couple of years to my seventh grade class. I found out I had Savant Disorder, a rare form of Aspergers that meant I was exceptionally talented at one thing and unbearably terrible at everything else. In my case, I was blessed with the arts. I would draw and paint beautiful landscapes, compose music (once I got my hardass band director to cry. The song I had created apparently reminded him of a dead relative), and write simple short stories that would capture the imagination of all my closest friends. Speaking of fiends, I only had a handful, but we were all very close. I was the constantly positive shy goofball and sometimes my rampant optimism got the better of me, making some encounters extremely uncomfortable. By the time I had graduated from my high school, I had matured into an awkward young man. Medium length wavy black hair, fair skin, and steel-blue eyes (courtesy of my parents being from Japan and Ireland). As soon as my nineteenth birthday came to an end, I started having these headaches. At first I attributed this to not having enough sleep. I was staying up all night responding to writing prompts on Reddit and sleeping for only three of four hours. However, even when I attempted to change my sleeping habits, the headaches continued with a vengeance.
About a week ago I was sitting in my bed, writing on my iPod touch, when I saw a bright flash of light outside my window. I got up groggily and pulled back the curtain. It was raining outside. ""Probably just some lightning,"" I mumbled to nobody in particular. As I was getting back under the warmth of my sheets, I saw it again and realized there was no accompanying thunder, even though the light was bright enough to be right outside my window. This woke me up a little more. I stood up again, looking for a reasonable explanation, when I heard a knock on my door.
I opened it to reveal my dad, but that wasn't what caught me by surprise. Or rather he wasn't the reason I practically shit myself.
Perched on his shoulder was a bizarre little creature. It was about the size of a large rabbit, and completely hairless, its wrinkly pitch black skin somehow glinting in the light of the hall. It had six legs, claws digging in to the material of my dad's old faded Rush t-shirt. It had a vaguely humanoid face with dark, beady little eyes, but where a mouth should be, it had a long proboscis which was presently jammed into the side of my dad's neck. I wasn't sure if I was dreaming, so all I could do is stand there. My dad asked if I was okay. I nodded weakly. He didn't look too sure, but he said good night and closed the door. I could only stand there in fear. What was that? I had no way of knowing. In my stupor I stumbled over to my desk and got online to try to search for anything that may have resembled that thing. No results.
The next morning I woke up with my laptop's keyboard stuck to my face. As I lifted my head up, I noticed FaceTime request from my friend. I opened it. We greeted each other like normal, with a few jokes and stupid references. Then the mood turned serious. My friend mentioned that his grandmother had recently passed. As soon as he said that, I saw one of those creatures phase into existence and jab its proboscis into his neck, not registering even a twitch of pain from him. I knew he wouldn't believe me if I told him. He's a cynic. Of course he wouldn't. So I tried to carry on out conversation by cheering him back up. As soon as he cracked a smile, the creature pulled itself out of his neck, and the better my friend's mood got, the farther away it seemed to get. We said our goodbyes and hung up.
Over the past week, I have experimented with different things, different emotions to make these creatures appear and disappear. I learned that they are drawn to negative emotion - they feed on something in the host's blood. Because of the little organ in my arm, I am aware of their presence. My hand doesn't phase through them. I tried picking one up three days ago and it stabbed me with its sharp little claws. I mean, if you had been ignored your entire life and someone just grabbed you, wouldn't the surprise force you to lash out? These creatures now know I am capable of making contact with them. Now they're going after my family.
I just felt something in my shoulder while typing this. I'll be right back. I want to see if these creatures feel pain.",0
"I glanced at the clock again. 1:05 am.
Only four more hours until i'm free to leave this hell of a job. I put my head in my hands and rubbed my temples, willing my eyes to focus again after staring at the monitor for three hours.
""Mike!"" the shrill voice of Laura popped my small bubble of tranquility, ""You better not be sleeping Mr. Chate.""
""Headache, Miss. I'm alright."" I went back to typing numbers off the clipboard in front of me into the computer.
""I hope you get better. I expect you to finish inventory tonight.""
*Yes your majesty. * ""Yes ma'am.""
She stalked away to torment some other poor coworker. Probably the janitor, she likes making him clean the toilets several times a night. It's too bad, Jack actually keeps the restrooms very clean, but Laura can't seem to deal with having an honest hardworking employee.
I peek at the clock again and groan. 1:06.
The buzzing of my phone pulls me out of my haze. I recognize the number but I can't quite place it. 484-7968. That's...my phone number from when I was a kid. The house I grew up in, I remember my mom turning the number into a sing so i'd remember it once I started school.
*"" Okay, you ready Michael?"" Mom smiled at me in the rear-view mirror. ""You know the phone number? ""*
*"" Yup! 484-7968, now Mi-chael can call home, great! ""*
*"" Good job rocket boy, remember that. If anything happens you call me, okay? ""*
*"" Okay mama. ""*
I answered the phone.
""Hello, is this the North Pole?""
I dropped the phone.
I recognized the voice.
I recognized *my* voice.
No, that's not possible. This isn't some Hallmark Christmas tale, this is real life. I'm working on Christmas eve...actually Christmas morning now. I'm not getting a call from Christmas past here, i'm getting a call from some kid, all kids sounds pretty much alike on the phone.
I picked the phone back up, still somewhat shaken.
""Hello? Mister Claus?""
I managed to choke out a reply.
""Yes, this is Santa.""
""It is! Hi Santa, you don't sound old."" I could hear the smile in his voice.
""I'm younger than most people think. What can I do for you kid?""
""Mama said maybe I could call about my Christmas list this year. She said she wasn't sure if you would be able to talk, I know you're very busy.""
""Well, it is Christmas Eve."" I chuckled despite the unimaginable conversation taking place. ""What did you want to ask for?""
""I want to see the future."" I froze.
""What future?""
""My future silly!"" I could hear his laughter, gentle and innocent.
""You want to know your future?""
""Yeah! Do I get rocket boots?""
Part of me wanted to tell him things to make his life better. Do the things I didn't do. Be good to mom. Convince her not to take that trip to California. Get the pipe in the wall repaired before it bursts. Don't date Luna Prince in the 11th grade or she'll tell the school you have lice. Don't take the year off after high school to travel, start working so you can save up for that engineering school. Dad is lying, he's not saving the money, it's all gone. Don't work ungodly hours to pay the bills. Don't hate yourself for getting caught in the vicious cycle of go to school so you can work and work so you can go to school.
Don't be me. Don't be me. Don't be me.
He was still talking about rocket boots and race cars when I interrupted him to answer.
""Slow down kid,"" I tried to think about what I was going to say.
I couldn't tell a kid that his life was going to get worse from here. Sure, people could use a nice dose of reality...but not when they're five.
""Okay bud, I can't tell you much, but I can tell you a little."" I heard a small squeal of excitement and couldn't help but smile. ""Your future...is whatever you want it to be. You can do anything you dream of.""
""Can I have rocket boots?""
""Absolutely. Do good in school, study hard and go to college, and make them yourself, you hear me? You can be the inventor that gives every kid on the planet rocket books. Heck, you could take my place and become a new Santa if you did that."" I could feel his smile through the phone. ""But I want you to remember something. Everything you do, do it for yourself. Be the best person you can be at everything. Be kind. Be good. Be strong, Most importantly,"" I took a deep breath, ""don't ever let anyone else slow you down. You go out and make the world work for you, don't just work for the world."" I knew half of this wouldn't even register with him, but saying it made me feel like I could make a real difference. As if I could give this kid the chance I didn't have.
It was silent for a while before he answered. ""Okay Santa, i'll be good. And smart. And the other things you said."" I smiled.
""Good to hear, kid."" there was the soft noise of rustling from the other end, and then the sound of a bed creaking.
""Sorry Santa, I think mama heard me and i'm not allowed to use the phone."" I laughed.
""I get it, Goodnight kid.""
""Goodnight Santa!"" I lowered the phone before I had a sudden thought.
""Hey kid, give your mama a hug every day too. Be good to her, you hear me?""
""I will Santa."" He hung up.
I stared at my phone for a while before I looked back up at the monitor and began typing more numbers. I glanced at the clock. 1:08 am.
I groaned and dropped my head onto the desk.
--
The door creaked open as he lay frozen under his blankets, pretending to be asleep but forgetting that sleeping people breathe too.
""Boy I know you're awake, you were talking on that phone again weren't you."" She turned the room light on as a gentle sigh came from under the blankets.
""Yes mama."" He sheepishly held out the phone for her to take back. She looked down at it and laughed a little.
""Why did you call the house phone silly?""
""It's the only phone number I know.""
*Of course* she thought with a smile.
""Talk to anyone interesting?""
""Yeah!"" he popped up in the bed, ""I talked to Santa!""
""Santa?"" she asked confused, ""well what did he say?"" In response he wrapped her up in his small arms and lay his head on her shoulder.
""He told me to be good and hug you."" She hugged her son tightly to her.
""That Santa is a smart man, ""she laughed, ""but now you gotta go to bed baby."" She wrapped him back in the blankets and kissed him on the forehead. ""It's way past bedtime for you and me.""
""Goodnight mama,"" he whispered sleepily.
Mama went to the door and turned the light off, smiling into the dark.
""Goodnight rocket boy.""",0
"Elon walked along the forest trail, breathing deeply of the smell of decaying leaves and cold. The sun was setting and the short, pale winter day had barely even melted last night's frost from the ground. He looked up at the sky, watching the now familiar arrangement of stars through the cold, dry air and the clouds of condensation from his breath.
It seemed like a sadly appropriate setting for the last few minutes of the human race. Winter and nightfall, the end of the cycle. Elon mused for a moment on how the cycle of seasons seemed to be a constant source of symbolism in the stories of all cultures that came from a place with a changing year. While the weather of his childhood was vastly different from that of his adopted home, the simple stories seemed to endure, no matter where you are.
He absentmindedly brushed his pocket where his smartphone usually was. It was, of course, gone. He had discarded it hours ago. It was doubtlessly buzzing away in the train station locker as hundreds of notifications, questions and urgent attempts at contact avalanched into it. Pointless buzzing. He had no desire for it to break his final enjoyment of the apocalypse.
The sky had faded from the pale champagne of the winter sunset to a deep purple. High cirrus clouds framed the growing green glow of the aurorae that were starting to dance, just a few seconds later than he had expected. Silent green and red fire wound in huge, sinuous curtains across the entire sky in a few seconds, far, far brighter than they had been in at least several million years.
Piercing through them, a painfully bright purple light blazed in the sky where Mars normally would have hung. All contact with the Martian colony would have been lost about 2 hours ago. Judging by the color and intensity, Elon quickly estimated that the surface temperature of the poor, dead planet must be climbing into the low millions of degrees as the final waves of neutronium kinetic impactors hammered it at nearly the speed of light.
At least the final curtain call for this place was pretty. Elon did not feel much guilt about humanity. *Homo sapiens* was an intriguing species and burned bright with potential. But it suffered the fate of being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The only technologically advanced sapient entity in 500 light years but still far too primitive to escape from the doom that was now bearing down upon them. Such was the story of countless millions of other species across the galactic disk over the last 2.7 billion years of recorded history. There was no sense in melancholy over an event as common as the rain washing away loose specks of dirt.
Elon took another deep breath, enjoying the exotic scents of the forest. So many unique chemical signatures, such a complex biochemical web. The loss of Earth's biosphere was a loss that he did feel with a keen, cutting pain. So much information, so much diversity, about to be lost forever. He wondered if some of his indifference to his dooming of humanity came from the anger from watching them squander the incomparable wealth they had inherited on this planet.
At least he had been able to save some of it. The first few years after landing here, he had spent his time incognito, gathering as many samples as he could from the biosphere. Precious engrams taken of genetic material, biosphere interactions, the flow of energy and chemistry. He had toiled as long as possible before packing up the data - a mere sliver of the bounty here - and launching it on a minus-space drone back to the fleet. There, it would be modified into new forms, integrated into the continuum and giving invaluable diversity to the whole. ""The strengthening of the web is the duty of the unique"" The mantra of his people still echoed through his mind, as clear and beautiful as the day he had learned it.
He had cursed the limited time he had. If only the fleet had been better positioned, his scout craft could have ridden to Earth along one of the spacetime currents tracing the ventral edge of the spiral arm and arrived here centuries earlier. It would have taken decades more to do a proper catalog. But any later and he would have run the risk of the drone's spacetime spoor being detectable by the long-range sensors of the approaching horde.
After the probe was gone, he had integrated into human society. A young male, traveling between continents for schooling made for an easy target. A quick assimilation of his bio-signatures and vaporization of the original body was simple. The lack of nearby relatives and the excuses of cultural barriers made his early mistakes in impersonation easy to cover up. Elon had never completely adjusted to this new form. Only two forward facing eyes incapable of visualizing ultraviolet light, the peculiar and problem-prone calcium-phosphate rigid armature for movement - his human shape had come to awkwardly fit like a mis-sized glove, stretched to fit over years of wear.
The most difficult task had been the ridiculous 'tense' structure of English. How a language could have such a complex set of constructs for temporal relationships still baffled him. Fortunately, his occasional pauses and stutters as he mentally parsed his syntax during interviews were brushed away as 'nerdiness' and being 'awkwardly charming'.
It had succeeded with barely 5 years to spare. Entrenched interests had nearly thwarted his plans to drive humanity to Mars colonization several times. How ironic that the most short-sighted and greedy of humanity had nearly saved it. After all, single-planet species were safe. The titanic, self-replicating machine hordes that scoured the galaxy would have silently passed humanity by, if not for Elon's prodding. However, that fragile, 225 human colony had doomed the entire species to a sudden and unstoppable eradication. A suicidal beacon in the predatory darkness of the cosmos. A singular answer to what humanity had called the Fermi paradox.
But in dooming this place, the horde had detoured precious distance anti-spinward, giving the home fleet just enough time and space to avoid their notice yet one more time.
Overhead, the aurorae grew in intensity until the greenish-red glow was nearly as bright as day. The leading edges of the horde's plasma lances were starting to smash into the upper atmosphere. Out of the corner of his eye, Elon saw a brief, white flash - probably the ISS being burned away in the torrent of superheated matter that was now washing over the planet. It was probably only a few more seconds before the plasma stream burned the atmosphere completely away and everything on the surface was scoured in purifying flame. Anything left in the deep oceans and in the crust would follow shortly after as the kinetic impactors boiled away the top several hundred miles of the Earth.
Elon sat down on a pile of forest detritus to the side of the trail. Cold wetness wicked through the seat of his pants but he didn't notice. Leaning back against the rough bark of a tree, Elon closed his eyes and narrowed his awareness down to the smell of the forest. Alien, deep and complex, the smell somehow reminded him of the concordance pools of home. He was filled with a deep regret that he would never smell them again, nor swim with his broodmates and lose his self in the song of the whole.
""The strengthening of the web is the duty of the unique.""
How he wished he could have been with it/we/them one last time...
Elon drew one last deep breath of the cold forest air.

"I was ushered into a dark room, where I see a man sitting in the dark wearing a black suit and his gold chain shining in what little light is in the room. I'm thrown onto the ground. I know why I'm here. The last words I want to hear come out of his mouth ""Where my money?"" I start crying trying to explain where my mom has went. BAM! I get kicked in the face. ""WHERES MY FUCKING MONEY!?""
Two weeks later, I'm sitting in my apartment shaking from withdraw. I have been doing cocaine for too damn long. All my money is being sucked away by this terrible habit formed from parting to much. ""What have I done?"" The sweat drips down my forehead as I hear my phone buzz. I pick it up. The text reads ""You want some more of the good stuff?"" A giant smile grows on my face. I respond letting my dealer know that I'm in dire need of a hookup but, spent all of my money earlier. Kevin, my dealer, texts back with ""I can give you some now, but, you'll have to pay more when you do get money."" I agree. I get the cocaine and never speak to him again.
Two weeks later. My door gets a knock on it. I have no clue who could be at the door at 9 p.m. I try to look through my peep hole, but, its shattered. I open the door cautiously. I'm punched and I fall to the ground. I catch a glimpse of two people in leather jackets before I pass out. I wake up in the back of a car. I have no clue what is going on. We stop. The trunk opens and a man in staring at me. He pulls me out and drags me into a building I had never seen. The smell of his cologne could cover a dumpster. I was ushered in and thrown onto the floor.
A man sitting in the dark room was what I saw.
I had only heard of this man.
He was known as 'The Cocaine God '",0
"The Swedes were once thought of as great friends of the Empire. We traded luxury resources, the two leaders even officially declared their friendship for each other. For centuries, Swedes served in the imperial guard, the vaeragers.
But after hundreds of years of peace and friendship they betrayed us. They attacked Antioch from the southeast. Our Army, while noumerous was out of Position, positioned to the northeast against the empire's archenemy, Polynesia.
The attack came swiftly. With seemingly endless numbers, the entire imperial Army was swept aside, and Antioch was taken. They turned their greedy gaze towards Adrianople next. The City could match even the imperial capital in terms of Population. Theodora issued a statement that the City must be defended at every cost.
The production of the entire Empire were shifted to producing military Units. Armories were errected throughout the lands, and the sizeable cash reserves of the empire were used to recruit merceneries.
The line Held, and the Swedes were pushed back. Peace talks were initiated, but the Swedes demanded Adrianople. Instead a counterattack was initiated.
After decades of bombardment and significant losses, the City was retaken for the Empire. But the Swedes too brought up more and more Forces, and soon took the City back. The stubborn General sitting bull that had led the Charge demanded to remain in the City as it fell, and perished.
But with great loss of life, the City was retaken yet again, its shattered Walls no longer an obstacle. To help defend it, experimantal Gatling Guns were pushed to the front lines, and they proved to be effective. It was another few years until the Swedes finally retreated.
The City, once the young but hopeful gem of the Empire, was devestated. Sack after Sack the Population dwindled, and now was reduced to next to nothing. Another peace summit achieved nothing.
After consolidating their Forces, Theodora now launched the counterattack. The Workshops of the Empire had now turned into efficient factories, and more and more new weapons were invented and brought to the frontlines. The war that was begun with Pikes, crossbows and Trebuches was now waged with rifled muskets, cannons and gatling guns.
After taking another City, the Swedes finally gave in. The Empire not just regained Antioch, but also expanded. The War lasted 300 years.
But the future was uncertain, and the Empire has bled much. While technologically superior to the Swedes, the Empire was behind the leaders. Immediatly to the east, the old archenemy of Polynesia was still threatening the Empire. In the far east, new powers were rising: Rome, the ""true"" Empire, trapmled it's enemies. Germany was at the head of Innovation of every kind. The Inca established a colony right at the doorstep of the Empire. To the South, the Swedes began playing friendly again, but were still not to be trusted.",0
"""Sire! Sire!"" The agitated messenger hopped from foot to foot. I sighed and turned from the report from India; typhoid from the Ganges had once again sprung up, so the Governor was calling for Empire Aid again.
""What is it, Lad? No, calm down. *Breathe*. There we go. Now what?""
""Sire, there's rebellion being plotted! I was sent by the Blackrod; Mutterings of independence, of treason!""
""WHAT?!? By whom? The Empire's never been so integrated. We have representatives from all Nations in my Government, the pound is strong; heck, we've even managed to wipe out malaria!"" Suspicion bloomed from an old note, sent from across the pond. ""It's not those daft ones in the Americas, is it? What do those lunatics call themselves, the seventy-sixers?""
""No sire! It's...it's..."" The shock was carved across his face ""It's the *English*, sire""",0
"It has been three months since the Great Death. I wander the ruins of Houston, trying to make sense of what wicked world I live in now, while trying to hold onto the remnants of a life I once lived before civilization fell. One afternoon, I found a VHS tape- Still protected by a paper case, labeled 'the Last VHS on Earth.' so, with my curiosity, I hooked up a VCR and TV to an old generator, hoping that I'd see a message from another soul, some thing I haven't had in ages. The world was a miserable and lonely place. I sat back in the chair, outside of the old library, and pressed 'PLAY' on the VCR.

Look around you.
All things related to living are replicating fractals, and notions are no exception.
Neuronal impulse patterns, brain structure, germs of various types.
Humans see the world through the lens of their bodies, and then their bodies craft the world around them in their own self-image.

Depression is intractible, and we are fortunate that its life cycle is self-limiting.

"""So, what have you been struggling with the most?"" Dr Frankenstein asked one of his fellow competitors as he sat backstage before the event.
""Glutes, mostly."" Arnold replied.
""Glutes?"" Frankenstein thought to himself ""This guy's good, I wasn't even going to be going into such detail. I've been struggling with just getting this guys head on straight in practice and this guy is already going into muscle details? I'm so going to lose.""
""You?"" the man asks the visibly anxious Doctor.
*Think, think of something, you can't just tell him 'the head' he will know you're a fraud. ""The vas deferens and the genitals have been particularly tricky.""
Arnold smiled, picked up his protein shake, and walked away quickly.
""Okay everyone, let's get out on stage"" Ivan called as the contestants filed out of the small holding area.
The doctor watched as they all stripped down. ""Well that's confident,"" he said to himself as he pulled up his long black rubber gloves. ""I'd rather stick to more sanitary methods"" he added as he signaled to Igor to wheel out his cart of miscellaneous body parts.
""Do you hear them? They are all applauding the work already, this will be a disaster! And where on earth did you get this duodenum; are you trying to give him a peptic ulcer?""
""Sorry, master""
Terrified but knowing he had to face his fears the doctor put on his face and pushed the cart out onto the stage.
""I apologize for the delay"" the young doctor said as he introduced himself and grabbed his scalpel. ""It is important that you remove any necrotic flesh before you begin, scooping out the left eyeball of his specimen, ""And always bring extras!"" he joked as he held up the rotting tissue.
Wilhelm screamed and set off a panic throughout the venue as people jumped over each other to exit the auditorium. ""Oh jeeze,"" Frankenstein began ""I'm so losing my tenure over this.""
Looking out over the empty room the doctor could only sigh and judge himself for his failures when suddenly a hand came across his shoulder, giving it a little squeeze of assurance.
The doctor turned around to see Ivan standing there with a smile on his face, ""So, can I watch?""",0
"*Sunday, May 11, *
Three days ago I found out about my condition, and three days ago was the last time I had tasted sleep. I was incredulous at first, when I was brought in by the worldwide funded NCP, or the Natural Cause Phenomenon, Research Group. However…the file in front of me quickly turned that incredulity into denial, fear, and hysteria.
12,525 days I had been alive and more or less than 12,525 lives had been lost. The countless faces in the overfilled file were all killed--*murdered*--by me, because I fell asleep. The elderly, sick, disabled, men, women, children, everyone…were in this file because *I fucking fell asleep*.
I could maybe live with one or two maybe with extensive therapy, but in the thousands? But 12,525? **Twelve-thousand five-hundred twenty-five people** dead. All because life has a twisted sense of humor and watched on as I unwittingly killed 12,525 human beings to entertain it with my sick existence.
The NCP Group have tried to reassure me that they will find a cure so I can live a normal life and even to ensure my condition to be kept a secret for my safety. They ran many tests on my while I was there with the request I return upon request for further analyzation. The Group sent me home many hours later with suggestions of dramatically adjusting my sleep schedule to cut the amount of times I sleep as little as possible by prolonging the amount of hours I stay awake and in consequence, prolonging the hours I sleep without interruption.
Day one was easy enough as my mind was too preoccupied, a mixture of coffee and energy drinks carried me over day two, but day three has been consumed by my delirium that no amount of blaring music can cure and the only thing keeping me awake is what's left of my stubbornness and lingering horror. I can't keep this up; surely I will collapse tomorrow - if not today, and kill another.
I'm not strong enough for this, and am ashamed to admit that I'm more consumed by the fear of what everyone else will do to me when this inevitably leaks out that I'm the one who took away so many loved ones from the world than of myself. That's why I'm writing this, because I'm too much of a coward to face the masses and receive what I deserve and I want the world to know that I am not doing this out of some self-sacrificing heroism.
I'm doing this because I am weak, and am much too afraid to end it with a quick bang.
I'm afraid of pain and would rather take one more with me than to die in any other way than my sleep. I truly am a monster.",0
"Brigadier Clairvoyant stalked through The Magnificent's lair. The Magnificent had been rampaging throughout the city for weeks now, killing, stealing, and wreaking havoc. He was the worst villain the city had seen in decades. His craftiness made his attacks incredibly effective, and worse still, there were rumors that he was using the proceeds of these attacks to complete a brainwashing ray. The Magnificent had defeated Lord Puncher, had defeated The Industrial Captain, but Clairvoyant was different. Where Magnificent had trapped other supers, those supers who relied on their powers, Clairvoyant was different. Clairvoyant had to rely on his brain, had to find every advantage he could get to make up for his lack of physical ability.
This made it difficult for him to fight a normal villain. But Magnificent was worse than a normal villain, was craftier, knew how to beat a super. This was why Brigadier Clairvoyant kept his exploits low-key, and waited for situations like these. Because the best way to deal with a villain like nobody's ever seen is to give them a hero like they've never seen.
Brigadier Clairvoyant maintained his psychic aura, ready to detect the minds of any nearby guards. He couldn't be too careful. If he was detected, his means of fighting back or escaping were limited. So he merely had to stay undetected.
A guard! No, two. No, a lot of guards, in fact. All around one room. Brigadier Clairvoyant read closer.
*Why are we guarding the latrine? I get that supers'll think its important, but they won't fall for it for long, and it'll get me killed. I should have taken that job at Wal-*
Brigadier Clairvoyant moved on through the dimly-lit, sparsely decorated concrete lair. It made sense that it would be, as Magnificent would waste no money on trivialities. Any funds would go towards his dastardly plans.
That was when he saw the doors. Massive, double, oaken doors. Exquisitely hand-crafted, gilded with gold, ornate doorknobs. Guarded by two guards who appeared to be veterans of multiple wars, skilled enough to pose a challenge to any super. Brigadier Clairvoyant grinned. Now here was a challenge. Neither guard knew what was inside the room, either, which showed just how important it was.
Brigadier Clairvoyant began to think on just how to pass this challenge.
Ten minutes and several feet of shoelace later, he was in.
And he was shocked. The entire room was filled with exquisitely bound books. In the center of the room was an armchair as magnificent as its owner, facing a fireplace. But nobody was sitting in the chair, and nobody was in the room. Just books. Brigadier Clairvoyant moved towards the shelves, running a hand over the spines of the books, wondering what would bring Magnificent to spend so much on books, of all things.
Then he noticed the titles. Or rather, the title. One title, and a worrying one at that. *How to make sure no one is reading your mind*. Every book had that title. He took one last check for other people and picked a book off the shelves.
Why were the pages blank? Why would he-wait. There was something on that last page, what was it?
*Distract him. *

"""Oprah?"" I screech at myself. The nappy, curly, natural black hair shakes with my reflection. This is a joke- one of those syndicated prank shows, where everyone will come out at the end, laughing at me. Laughing, toting Burbank sized cameras, asking me to fill out consent forms to legally exploit my humiliation. Only that doesn't happen. There's a full body mirror in the bathroom when I ""discover"" I'm Oprah, so I think the best thing for me to do is spread my asscheeks as wide as I can pull them, and look into Oprah's ass.

When you find a homeless man named Rhonda waiting outside, asking if you would like pleasure for crack, you soon find out that Oprah's asshole is in fact, a slum.

They stick one string up, dangling accross the nipples...fantasizing about Oprah's unwaxed mustache tickling their nipple.....They stick the second string up, up a little to high for comfort, but they will do anything to appease Oprah. The third one- there's no where to put it anywhere else but anally.

Ray Thompson lay with his cheek pressing on the scorching desert sand, arm stretched desperately towards a water skin. His bare chest burned with each shift in the grains as he inched closer to the leather. Running a dry tongue over cracked lips, the large man used all his strength to push himself the final bit of distance. He grabbed the water skin and pulled his arm back like he'd been bitten by a cobra.
Ray managed to roll onto his back and put the smooth skin to his lips. Only a few drops fell into his mouth, but they were Godsend. He closed his eyes in bliss and felt his tongue re-moisten like the old sponge his mother used to wash the dishes. He felt something else fall into his open mouth.
Six individual pricks moved down the roof of his mouth and into his throat. Ray rolled back to his stomach and began choking, trying to loosen the intruding...whatever it was. He managed to get to his knees, feeling adrenaline kick in, and coughed violently. He felt his chest expand and retract with each cough like a drum when beat. The six points made their way down his throat, into his esophagus. He felt the points move individually, but as one. Perhaps a scorpion.
He got a deep itch from inside of his body. Ray brought up a hand and punched himself in the chest, right over the itch. He felt the hits connecting, but no pain from them. He was either too weak to punch properly or too close to death to feel the pain.
As he began to panic, a sharp pinch came from his chest. Ray's eyes widened as he tried to scream, but he didn't hear any noise come out. He hadn't heard any noise for...days? When did he come out here, anyway?
Ray shook his head as he found his thoughts wandering. The pain in his chest spread outward, as though a sun had been born within it.
He felt a sudden grasp inside of him let go. Perhaps the scorpion fell into his stomach, made itself food for him. Ray smiled, snickering in the heat.
All this time, he had been starving, but couldn't take care of it. He fell back to his hands and knees, laughing hysterically, though the sound of his laughter didn't reach his ears.
All this time he couldn't eat, so the food walked *into* his mouth!
Randy...Ra...Ray! Ray held his stomach and fell face first into the sand, feeling the burn on his eyelids as he continued laughing.
It walked into his mouth!
Ray fell back to the sand, laughing helplessly as the sun climbed the sky.
Perhaps this would finally be it.",0
"Not a single person in the crowd of Nora Janice's Funeral had spoken a word. Friends, Relatives, and a few other people all bonded together in the stillness of the moment. Even Nora's own parents were seen, with no idea how she could have been a part of such a horrible death. Soon, an image appeared in the front of the room. The image of Norah soon became a video, and papers were heard rustling around. Tears could be seen creeping down the young eyes of the girl, and those tears began to spread throughout the room as she spoke.
> Hello. If you are hearing this, t-then they must have gotten to me. I don't know why, but I know that soon I will be...dead. I pray you never have to hear this, but I guess if you are hearing this, it's too late.
The camera showed a barren room with notes on a desk in the front, a plain chair, and dim lighting highlighting the webcam glow on Nora's youthful face. It must have been recorded very recently before her death, but she still looked too young for someone like her to be gone so soon.
> Ok, I need to start at the beginning I guess. Most of you must have known me as a perfect little girl with a great heart and all that. That's not the full me. Ok, ok, calm down, I've never told anyone this, calm down.
By this time, everyone in the crowd had undergone a change from a teary-eyed and mournful mood to some feeling much more intrigued. Nora wasn't a crazy conspiracy theorist, or ever been mentally unstable. Well, maybe she did seem a bit strange at times, but the way she was speaking now made her seem absolutely insane.
> When I was kid, I had terrible nightmares. Every time I had one of these nightmares, it was the same kind of thing. I saw people dying. But - Here's the thing, it actually happened. Like, I was dream of some man I'd never seen before getting beaten to death with a club, and a few days later I would see him on the news as a murder victim. Now it happens - or, well - happened, about every month or two. A few stand out in my brain. A week before 9/11 was horrible. I tried to help out a stranger I saw on the streets, but to no avail. He wouldn't listen, I tried to warn him!
Now, the audience was fidgeting. Nora's parents were the most shocked, and all the others in the room were mimicking their expressions. Sure, maybe a few things about the way she acted made sense now, but she was just another girl. At least that's what everyone in the room had thought for the last 20 or so years she'd been alive.
> For the past week, I have been having a different kind of vision in my sleep. I see myself. I'm in some room of my house, and someone walks in. I'm laying on my desk, and I can't see his face. Papers are laying around everywhere, and he just walks over to me with, s-some kind of gun or something, and then...and then I wake up. I know it's going to happen soon, and, i just don't know when. Probably in a couple of days, but it could be soon. I just- I don't know what to do.
On screen, she began to lay her head down in pure fear. She threw some of her notes down on the floor, and they gently rested down on the floor. The video feed stood still for a moment, then a creaking was heard. A door opened, and a man walked in. The man looked down at Nora, and shot.",0
"Oh, you know I miss you,
When your body's cold and dead.
You know I miss your misery,
Back when we wore your red.
Oh, you know I miss you,

Beautiful, salty, and cold.
My friend, my foe - my future wives -
The ones to whom I pledge,
To never leave a stone unturned,
Or leave you hanging on a ledge.
I know in life we disagreed:
You thought I was insane.
But please, excuse my temperament,
For it only affects my brain.
Come on, I gave you life's great thrill!
To die in horrid fun!
I gave all that I could give in life,
Yet still, from me, you run.
At times this world does not make sense,
With its twisted moral rights.
Yet when I had the most of fun,
Was in our heated verbal fights.
Oh, you know I miss you,
And the pain you made me feel,
When you fled from my fleeting offer of death,
And I had to catch you by the heel.
Oh, you know I miss you,
Despite what you do to me.

Is it because death is free?",0
"Huo Pao was old and scrawny. He was hardly the right person to appeal to incoming freshmen at the university. The students were sent by their wealthy parents, and some even had advanced tutoring to summon up cantrips. Of course, every guy wanted to learn fire and lightning, but he was loathe to take them on; they would most likely become tyrants that would need heroes to stamp out. Likewise, they didn't want him. No, they wanted to be taught by loud and proud artillery battlemage, who could conjure great firestorms through excessive channeling of their powers.
A pox on them anyway, Huo Pao thought. He was about to exit the hall when he saw a boy. Average height, but unusually fit. Shabby clothes. Very nervous, judging by the jackrabbiting of his right foot. Yet, a nervous person would look around around, trying to both meet a gaze and avert theirs at the same time.
This boy was looking at everyone's magic.
""What do you see, boy?"" The boy jumped in his seat, startled at the low voice.
""Wh-what?""
""I see you looking at their hands. Tell me what you see.""
""Well...that guy over there, he weaves his magic like a pen. But I saw him doing the same thing earlier today. He only knows that one move, but he's good at it.""
""And...what about that girl over there?""
""I think she already knows some charm magic. There are a ton of guys looking at her, but that didn't happen until she was halfway through the room. You ask me, she's kinda dumpy.""
""So what are you so nervous about? Seems you can already read their magic.""
""But...just because I can read it doesn't mean I can write it. I'm just a farmboy who almost burned down the barn over a little scuffle with my pa. Kinda went off like a dragon, but I don't know how to do it again.""
Huo Pao stroked his chin. Farmboy was certainly different...and while many farmers had an affinity for earth or water, this boy had fire in his gut. Although many magi may eschew fitness, strong heart and lungs were key to efficient fire evocation, especially if you wanted to skip casting steps.
""You do realize they've been at this for months, right? Don't compare yourself to them yet."" He realized he forgot something. ""What's your name?""
""My name? Uh...Siyo, sir.""
""Walk up to that instructor over there. Tell him Huo Pao is going to win the bet, then blow your dragon breath on his boots.""
""But I don't --""
""I know, you couldn't do it again...until now."" Huo Pao poked him in the solar plexus. ""Heave, but not from your throat. Do it from down here, and project like you want the biggest echo in the valley. Got it?"" With a nod, the boy got up. After halfway towards the instructor, he looked back...but his strange trainer was gone.

"Adam and I had a difficult marriage. He desired a demure, obedient little wife. As if. I left his naked ass so fast. So, naturally God - who's also a man, mind you - declared the marriage null and void. He started again, creating the most beautiful creature I've ever beheld, notwithstanding the fact she came from that narcissistic ass's rib. Long red tresses like fire incarnate. Brilliant emerald eyes like deep green pools, pulling me into their abyss. Lovely as the eve she was named for.
Too bad she desired to be a dutiful wife. Giving Adam bratty sons, doing as he asked day in and day out. I watched from outside that overrated Garden. Until one day, as luck would have it, she ventured away. That natural curiosity had a way of getting the best of her. I pushed my raven hair behind my ear and stepped out from my place of observation to introduce myself. Naturally she was shocked, having been told it was just herself, Adam, and those ridiculous sons. Overcoming that shock, however, curiosity once more took hold of her.
We became fast friends. Every day she would come to see me. Shy at first, the words soon began to cascade from her tongue into my pool of understanding. We became nearly inseparable, and because of this Adam grew suspicious and one day followed her.
""You!"" he gasped upon seeing me, eyes nearly popping from his head, a vein on his temple fit to burst.
""Me,"" I agreed with a smile pulling at my lips.
""This, this cannot stand! Come, Eve. At once."" He demanded.
""And if I challenge you for her hand, Adam?"" I asked, my voice still calm and assured.
Adam laughed. ""What? Impossible. It's Adam and Eve, not Eve and Lilith. Don't be crass.""
Casting a sidelong glance at Eve, I replied, ""I mean it. If you can solve my riddle...I'll stay away. If not, well, Eve gets to choose.""
Gulping past the thyroid cartilage in his neck that made it look like he'd swallowed a forbidden apple, he slowly assented with a nod. Ever the self-assured posturer, that one.
""What is harder to catch the faster you run?"" I asked. Not even a hard one.
""Uh, a snake. Obviously."" He said, holding out his hand to Eve. ""Come along,"" he said smugly.
""Your breath, is the answer,"" I replied, looking to Eve. With no hesitation, she moved and took my hand. Adam paled and looked near to fainting, but he knew he had lost.
Eve and I have been together since, living in our own little garden of bliss. I've been labeled a demon, of course, but it's a small price to pay to have that fair creature in my arms. Doesn't hurt Adam has turned into an unshaven, self-loathing slob who blames snakes for his misfortunes.",0
"""They don't believe we're interesting?"" one of the younger mermaids, Ari, asked, looking around the elders of the council. Of all the reasons for the decline of the last several decades, *interest* had not been one she had thought about. Low birthrates, weak magic, and increased illness and death in their people had spurned the mer- and hydro- species to gather and think of something to stop what would soon be the end of them all. That it was the human's fault was implied, but how was the question.
""It is the fault of their aeroplanes,"" an old mermaid replied. Ari did not know her personally, they were from different seas, but the merwoman had been kind to her despite her age. Ari was the only representative healthy enough from their bay to journey here, even if she was young.
""Ships are not used as much for transport,"" the Pacific mermaid continued. ""And when they are they are so big and well-made that our songs do not reach them. There is no reason to fear us. We may look pretty, become a tale to tell with friends if we are seen, but then we are forgotten.""
""Which is a problem,"" a siren added. She lounged on a giant open clam, the self-appointed head for this group. Her songs at least, on occasion, brought about disappearances around Bermuda. ""Belief does not have to be real to fuel magic, to fuel *us*. Interest in fictional variations of our kind would be enough. But all of that is now taken up by vampires, or zombies. And we? From what I hear I am relegated to literature no one reads for pleasure, and my dear mermaids you are children's toys.""
""Children have interest,"" the old mermaid replied. ""About a quarter century ago we had several good years. I began to find dolls and toys in the sewage near people that showed a red haired mermaid.""
""But only for a while. You know soon after that it was lions or some other nonsense.""
""Then.."" the younger mermaid began her thought, but paused. The elderly mermaid smiled to her and nodded for her to continue. The siren looked interested. Ari turned to the oceanids and nereids- it had been something they had said earlier that day that now came back to her.
""Then perhaps we must do what our ancestors did,"" Ari said. ""We come up to the surface, to the isles, up the deep rivers because we had to get to the people. Now they have other ways of transport, but water is important to us all. We must simply find other places to dwell.""
""Yes!"" a nereid added. ""My cousin, she went to the beaches and then amid the people and their buildings when my young brother became sick. She found small ponds with no fish or plants, but where many people would go to play. It was close to home, so at night she could return, but during the day she enticed two young men into such a frenzy they fought for her in the deep end and drowned! My brother's fever broke and he is now well because of their deaths and fear.""
""Exactly!"" Ari gestured to the other young woman. ""We have to go to them, make ourselves known.""
""It could work,"" the elderly mermaid said. ""We did always see who could go closest, and the one who brought someone in from the land would win. But lately such games have not been on our minds with the bad times.""
""We just have to make sure they know it is us, and not something silly like sharks.""
Now inspired, the group began making plans for their emigration onto land and the shallow waters. The young people, those who were healthy and could take the shape of humans, would slowly begin to the move to the fresh waters and those lakes and ponds that did not return to the ocean. The occasional drowning would be a good start, and as they settled into their new homes they could connect with that new part of the world. Surely a lake, even a pool or a fountain, needed a spirit as much as the ocean or a river did?",0
"Almost always, I write without an outline. However, a couple times, I've used a very vague ""tentpole method"" outline--as in, I've got a couple ideas that lead up to a conclusion. For example, when I wrote my NaNoWriMo novel last November, I wrote out three ""tentpoles"" which were the beginning, middle, and end of my story, at about a paragraph each. I have another one which is doing the same thing, but in terms of three books of 40k each (a paragraph each).
For everything else I've written though, it's off the top of my head. Sometimes I don't even have a proper ending in mind, just maybe a couple ideas I'd love to toss in. A lot of people love serious outlines, but I end up going ""why do an outline when I can just write the book?"" I should probably try to outline more so that I have a firmer idea as to where my stories are going.

"It's quiet, living on the edge of town I manage to get away from the hustle and grind of the cyber city Teletariam. It was the first city that really embraced technology and set the standard for how cities needed to change and grow in the late 21st century. Cities across the globe had been integrating and modifying their cities but lacked the proper planning and initiative to effectively implement the modern marvels.
Teletariam changed that, being built East of Denver Colorado at the foot of the hills it served to be a beacon of new life. The series of revolutionary wars that occurred across the country from 2058-2093 left the country more united and stronger then ever, but beaten down and rebuilding. Teletariam was built as the new capital of the United West and served as the most technologically advanced city to ever be produced. We of the West take pride knowing that it stands tall, a symbol of our rebuilding, devotion and resilience.
My name is Gabriel and I work outside of this modern Haven as a farmer. They city produces most of its food internally but I grow larger row crops that not only support citizens but are used in various manufacturing processes. It's a Tuesday and like every Tuesday I get up feed the dogs while I power up and prep my cropbots for the day. I watched the news on a heads up display when I felt it. The ground shaking as if the world itself wanted to rip apart. I ran outside and the sun was eclipsing a large object in the sky? The shaking changes from a violent shift to a rumbling, I can feel it in my chest. A sense of panic runs through my veins, what is going on. An attack from the east, southern rebels, or something else?
With out a second to waste I ran through my shop, grabbing my binoculars, up the spiral stairs to my overlook I look toward the sky, it's a ship. Something I have never seen before, it is huge, coated in silver with orange accents. It eclipsed the sun, taken back from how big it is I look below large vessels had landed on the surface and something is heading this way.
Peering through my binoculars I cannot believe what I see....
Horses...
Unbelievable...
But who is riding them, or what?
These horses are bigger then anything I have ever seen before. Plated in armor covering all their vital and soft spots, I can see the breath burn from there nostrils as they gallop towards me. The riders appear to be wearing silver armor and a Lance blazing like the fire of a thousands sun's.
What am I looking at? As I took in the display off my overlook, over my head flies a legion carrier of the United West Marine corps. They land 500 meters from my shop right on my ready to harvest crops. A batallian of troops, tanks, troop transports, heavy gunners and equipment rolls off and into the ready. Without wasting time the heavy gunners and tanks begin to fire long range rounds. I watch as the rounds strike the horses and there riders, but to my and the soldiers on the ground surprise there is no effect. The barrage stops and the soldiers appear to be regrouping.
Suddenly jets fly over head along with a c730 air cannon ship. Hell begins to rain down as the jets bomb and lay down aggressive fire. The c370 lays down hundreds of thousands of rounds with in seconds. The approach of the unknown enemy is unaltered and an uneasiness rises across the battlefield. Seasoned soldiers from the war began to bark at the marines, rallying them to get ready to make a stand. You can hear the horses breathing hard. They're getting close. The soldiers deploy the trenchers, digging trenches instantly. They jump in preparing to hold there defensive line.
The enemy approaches at about 150 meters all at once the riders draw there swords and suddenly the horses accelerate running all out. They are met by a barrage of bullets. Within seconds they are on top of the marines break through their line. Chopping and stabbing as they go. Most of the horses cleared the trench and the riders jumped into the trenches as blood flies everywhere.
I stand in astonishment, in front of me I have just witnessed a bloody violent confrontation and as I realize what I had just seen, that's when I see it. A young Marine who has confronted a rider.
The riders horse appears to have misjudged the trench and took a spill breaking its neck the marine fires on the downed rider and the shots hit his armor without penetration. The marine changes to incinerator rounds and fires. To no effect, the rider gets its senses and begins to stand. It is just over 2 meters tall and stands on its 2 feet.
Its clearly not from this planet but it resembles us. The rider rushes the marine. Within a second it has pushed its blade through the marines chest. But in the marines right hand he held his dagger and with his last bit of strength he plunged it into the riders neck. An explosion of blood came from the rider and a cry that stopped his companions in their tracks. They turned and flocked to there wounded soldier and surrounded him. In this moment the surviving marines fell back.
They're heading straight for my barn...

"Marry held the pills in her hand and looked intently at the clock. Everyone else in he room was too. Everyone in the country was, as far as they knew.
And it was almost time.
""Ten!"" The crowd all said in unison, as noon approached.
""Nine! Eight! Seven! Six!"" Marry held the pill and her water close to her mouth.
""Five! Four! Three! Two! One!"" And then there was silence as everyone popped their pills and sipped their water.
""Happy simultaneous medication day everyone"" Marry told the room. Everyone nodded and began filtering out of the break room back to their jobs, confident the stigma of many medications had been eroded with their brave mass dosing.
The next day Marry got pregnant. Unfortunately for her and many other woman on no other medications, the American Simultaneous Medication Time didn't correspond with her usual birth control routine at all.",0
"""Daaaad....Are we nearly there yet? I'm hungry!""
""Hello hungry! I'm dad.""
We all knew the routine. We all groaned on cue. It was the oldest 'dad' joke known to mankind and yet he still grinned like an idiot every time he used it. It was there at my tenth birthday party in it's 'excited' variant. It took on the 'nervous' form on the night of my prom. Hungry was the most common...and every time it heralded the groans and a stupid smirk from Dad.
I miss it. So much. Ever since the accident...it was like he doesn't know who I was anymore. But I still went back to the home, every day for eight months. I knew it couldn't be much longer now though...the nurses said he'd not been eating, despite their best efforts, and he was getting weaker and weaker.
""Please dad...I'm sorry. I shouldn't have stayed out so late. I should have stayed at Mike's instead of getting you to come pick me up. I'll do anything...just please don't die on me. I'm sorry."" I pleaded to him in his sleep. Or at least, I thought he was asleep.
""Hello Sorry....I'm....I'm Dad. Y....you be a g....ood boy and look after Tom for me. He's my son....a.....and he's the best thing I ev....er....did."" He wheezed, and grabbed my hand tight. I couldn't stop the tears, but even through them I could see that grin...that stupid, stupid grin like he was the funniest thing in the world.
For one last moment...it was me and my Dad again.
By eleven o'clock that night he was gone.
I miss those jokes...those terrible lines that were only ever funny once. I miss that moronic smile.
I miss my Dad.",0
"(This is my first story on here, please bear with my on any mistakes or if its just bad...here we go!)
I've been a gamer for almost my entire life. Fantasy in games became reality for me to escape my awful life growing up. I'm the basic, 'single mom, no dad, no money' kinda kid. Yet somehow I always scraped up enough money to buy the latest hit games, granted it was one game every other month or two.
I had been stressing about my mutation for years, wondering what it could be and what I could possibly do with it. I thought of it like a toy, I could be a real life superhero...just like everyone else. Thing is, power can change a person, fast.
I woke up right after midnight on my 21st birthday, feeling the intense burning all throughout my body, as everyone does receiving their power. After a few minutes of pain, it was over, and I was left wondering what I had been given. I tried lifting things in my one room apartment, no effect. I've always been a scrawny kid, no strength gains. I tried telekenisis, I wanted to be like Obi Wan. Still nothing. I tried to read my neighbors mind when asking for some coffee creamer the next morning. Still nothing. Then it happened.
I was walking alone, as someone with quite literally no friends does, when some guys tried to jump me. Their powers were obvious. Strength, claws, and the biggest was made of rock. Since the powers first started, it's separated people into many groups, mainly the good and the bad. These were clearly the bad, the ones who abuse kids who haven't reached 21 yet.
They picked me for being the scrawny kid I was, and assumed I didn't have my power yet. Even though I did, I didn't know what it was. They came at me, and I closed my eyes and held my hands up to shield the blows...and none came. I opened my eyes and a red, semitransparent shield was blocking their attempts to hurt me.
""I'm a conjurer...oh my God..."" I mumbled to myself as I made a sword appear and cut large gashes into all of them. They fell to the ground, and I made a headsman's ax appear and behead them, rather than let them bleed out.
After that incident, I realized how much power can get to your head. ""There are way too many bad people in the world...maybe I can do something about it..."" I said to myself as I walked through the worst neighborhood in Dallas. The criminals ran through the streets causing mayhem. I called their attention and they charged me. A lance here, a conjured bus over there, and even a few summoned, golem-like warriors dispatched most of the bunch fairly quickly. They stopped, realized that I had a very uncommon mutation. The 'leader' approached me, and offered me to take his place.
Now I rule most of the city, controlling the city with fear of my ever growing power and army of hood rat mutants.
The heroes usually win in comic books, but this isn't any dashing white knight's tale of heroism, this is my attempt at power. After all, power can really get to a person's head.",0
"You truly attempt to try out this great machine. The first date you set is forward about 2 days. You are warped forward to the day. You see that everything is completely normal. The only strange thing is that you know exactly what happened yesterday. You can vividly remember what you ate for breakfast, french toast with peanut butter and jelly. You can remember that you took your dog and 3 year old daughter to the park and played all day. Yet, you know you did not live that day. You think that maybe this will continue to happen so you travel 2 years into the future. Today is the day you send your daughter to kindergarten, you hold back tears as she whispers ""I love you Daddy"" into your ear then runs off to join her friends in class. You stand, wondering where the time went, how it seemed to speed by. Days you remember but you did not live. You enjoy the moment then you use the machine to skip ahead 18 years. The day is her wedding day and you walk her down the isle to her waiting groom-to-be. You are holding back tears as you let her go and she whispers ""I love you Daddy."" You have never been so happy for her yet you still wonder how you remember your little girl graduating high school, getting into her dream college, then graduating from there. You wonder how you remember these things knowing you have skipped those dates using the machine. You reach for the machine to turn it 30 years into the future. You're on your bed in the hospital surrounded by your daughter, son-in-law, and all four of their children. You are weak and old and clinging on to life hoping to last a few more minutes, a few more hours. You remember having such a great life, welcoming in your grandkids, vacations, retirement. Yet the thought still nags at you, how you remember but you never truly lived those days. When the time comes everyone knows. You hear your daughter whisper ""I love you Daddy"" and you start to cry. You reach for the machine hoping to turn it back to the first day, that day 40 years ago. But as you look for it, it's gone. Its only then you realize there was never a machine. Its only then that you realize you spent your whole time looking ahead that you forgot to look at the now.",0
"There are few that can compete with my father's business.
Sure, there are dream shops on nearly every corner, the peddlers within shouting out their wares and latest trends.
""*Become famous, with thousands of glowing fans, all wishing to spend time with you! *""
""*Riches, riches beyond your imagination! You'll be wading in gold, your hands to heavy to pick up from the rings! *""
""*Marry the most beautiful woman in the world, and spend a night with her! *""
There were thousands of adaptations, all slightly different from each other. But each bore the same flare- momentary pleasures, excitements that lasted throughout the night but dissipated in the morning, once the waking world took over again.
But our dreams are different - we do not focus upon passing pleasures, and as such the emotions and experiences of our dreams last long beyond the night they're used.
We sell the father's pride in watching his son become a man greater that he. We sell the wive's satisfaction of spending her life with a husband that loves her with his entire heart. We imbue our dream capsules with the slow burning emotions, such as the revelation of first timid love, or the feeling that, no matter the circumstance, *everything* is going to be all right.
When my father died, and left me his shop, he left his expertise behind as well - his secrets in creating these dreams, dreams so rare and powerful that no other shop could replicate them. And I strove to improve upon his life's work- to make the perfect dream, one that could be surpassed by no other. One filled to the brim with the deeper happinesses of life, one that would be considered perfection.
For ten years I labored, mixing my concoctions, boiling them down to the capsules to be sold, knowing by sight and smell alone if they would work. Adding ingredient's such as fresh baked apple pie, my mother's own recipe, a freshly written love note between a couple just married, or the bottled smell of salt air off the ocean coast.
And finally, finally, I found the recipe, consisting of one hundred and forty four special ingredients. But just as I finished, the door of my shop opened, and a man entered- a man whose face was so wrinkled he had to be older than my dead father, and whose grey hair curled down his back. He turned his sunken eyes towards me as I removed the capsule, and spoke, his voice low and defeated.
""How much?""
""It's not yet for sale,"" I answered, setting in on the counter.
""Name your price, and I'll pay it."" He said, approaching me at my workstation, and leaning against the counter.
So I did.
And he did.
And taking the capsule, he dropped it to the floor of my shop, grinding it into the stone with his heel as I shouted.
""Wait! What a waste! That pill, it bore happiness incarnate, it bore the full meaning of living! It was the perfect dream!""
""Yes,"" Answered the old man, turning to leave, ""Yes it was. A happiness so great that it can never be attained in reality, one that will forever cast the rest of your life in shadow, knowing that it is false, yet the most real thing you can imagine.""
""And how would you know that?""
""Because when your father made one, thirty years ago, I took it. And ever since, I've had to live with the nightmare.""

"""Urghhhh.. Umphh.. AH!""
Pushing open a front door that has two fresh corpses lying against it is not an easy task. Made harder by the fact that the middle aged lady corpse was morbidly obese.
""At least being dead will do her figure some good."" thought James. ""What an inconveniance! Certainly not a task suitable to a beautiful Tuesday morning.""
James squeezed his skinny frame out of the front door and carefully stepped around the bodies. He wasn't particulary upset by the site of the dead bodies - after all death was just a part of life. The very last part. He didn't like the smell much though. Or the inconvenience the dead could cause. In particular he couldn't understand suicidal people who could be so rude as to jump right in front of a train as their choice of fatality. The delays they caused! Didn't they care?
James had already left a message on the emergency services answer machine to come and collect the bodies and so felt he had done his duty. Bit strange they hadn't actually answered the phone line, he had thought.
He walked around the corner and saw a large red vehicle that instantly lofted his spirits.
""Ah ha some good luck this morning! The bus is actually waiting at the stop. Incredible!""
James hurried over to the stop. The door was open and he hopped on board.
""A return to Paddington if you please"" he commanded.
No response.
""Sir! Sir?""
Still nothing.
James gasped. He couldn't believe it. The driver must have fallen asleep. On the job no less! Standards seemed to be slipping daily!
Well he wasn't going to be waking anyone. That would be too kind to this lazy good for nothing. He would instead write a letter of complaint. Let this man's boss deal him, which would no doubt end in his redundancy.
He stepped off the bus, feeling mainly annoyed but with a tinge of satisfaction.
He started walking towards the train station when he noticed a lump on the floor. It was a body and it's head was facing the wrong direction.
""Perhaps I should consider moving"" he mused.
For the first time since stepping outside he looked around properly. In the distance in almost every direction there were lumps on the floor. Bodies.
It was quickly becoming a very strange day.",0
"The stark chords of Tosca begin once again; Scarpia's motive is the first thing the audience at La Scala Opera hear. Perhaps they are jaded by it, but it still elicits within me feelings from a bygone life. Soon we'll see entrances from Cavaradossi and of course our leading lady, Tosca, forced to do the unspeakable and murder one man to try and save another's life. Poor Tosca; if only she had known that Cavaradossi was truly given a stay of execution, perhaps she would have accepted Scarpia's demand for intimacy.
The people will then shuffle out of the opera theatre, lazily critiquing the same show that they've seen entirely too often here in Milan, and go out to the cafés and restaurants that they've been to many times before. Their lives, seemingly on a loop, continue at their leisurely pace as I sit by in my darkened villa above the streets watching the days pass by.
Acquaintances of mine always asked, ""Why move to Milan?"" ""You don't know Italian, do you?"" ""Why now?"" they'd ask with all the sincerity of a Hallmark Valentine's Day card. I'm not sure that I'd ever have an answer for them, because they were right to question my motives. Why choose to fundamentally change the eternal workings of the vampiric lifestyle?
For one, the Milanese choose to stay out until the ungodly hours of 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, meaning that my food is usually spiked with the residual alcohol from their Lombardy region chardonnay and pinot bianco by the pint. However, even getting past the eternal hangover that is my life, how do I avoid that villainous vegetable that the Italians seem to put in every dish: garlic.
Oh the dreaded aglio. For so often I took it for granted during my time in Vienna. Stakes could be easily enough avoided with good planning (an internally locked coffin with plenty of reinforced steel between my face and the world that might wish to destroy me), but the Austrians never bothered with garlic quite as often as they do here.
Perhaps I might go back to Vienna and dine off the simple people whose beer consumption is admirable as much as it is shameful. Perhaps I will get back to hearing the operas of Strauss and Mozart, or maybe the occasional performance of Marschner's ""Der Vampyr."" But for now, I sit like Tosca, in a place I should never wish to be waiting for the right moment to make my escape and be free again. Now, this never sleeping city of Milan holds me hostage with the taste of death on everyone's lips.",0
"They can't see me
They can't see me
Their children gone
Oh, so dreamy
Every single one
They yell and cry
And scream my name
They hunt with flame
And want me to die
They can't see me
But they chase me
Over land and over sea
The stormy rainy sea
Finally on a foggy meadow
I want to rest but see a shadow
The hunters come with sword and flame
Where they suspect the one to blame
They yell my name once more
With all those throats oh so sore
I leave my camp and try to flee
Afraid of them for now they see
I leave the fog and the meadow
Not taking my eyes from their shadow
They're searching with a dying flame
And in the fog they scream my name",0
"The gas encroached over the top of the trench. William McKenzie's eyes saw the green smoke almost immediately and the words escaped his mouth, ""Gas! Gas! Gas!"" The soldiers in the trenches, most of whom were taking a break from the battle and smoking on cigarettes, sprung into action. They grabbed their weapons and then hurried themselves against the dirt wall in the trench, hoping their Mage would make it in time.
""Everyone, inhale!"" A male voice shouted as he hopped into the middle of the trench. His long, ornate cloak spoke that he was a Magus of the Fifth Order, under directive from the King himself to guard and defend his territory and people. He spun his hands together and William watched in awe as a yellow aura filled in the middle of his palms. A collective inhale from his Platoon happened and the Mage yelled something incomprehensible to himself and the other soldiers. The yellow aura erupted out of his hands as he threw them over his head. It pushed against the green smoke and slowly, but very surely, pushed the smoke back over the top of the trench.
It took some time and the Mage kept his eyes shut the entire time. William was the first to step up, counting the forty-odd soldiers in his Platoon--three of whom from another Platoon that he picked up on their first retreat--and made sure everyone was accounted for. When he reached the number three, he heard the sound of a grenade hitting the mud at the bottom of the trench.
""Ambush!"" Someone shouted and jumped on top of the grenade before William could react. It shot upwards into his stomach, tearing the soldier apart and killing him instantly.
""Protect the Magus,"" William shouted as the gunfire erupted. Two soldiers, Privates as William noted, lunged forward and grabbed the Mages' arm. They pulled him down in the middle of his incantation and broke his concentration. His eyes broke open.
""What is happening?""
""Ambush. I need to get you to safety,"" William said as he fired off his rifle over the trench. There was no telling how many Germans were launching an attack and William's primary objective was to keep the Magus safe. Territory control was minor compared to holding the most powerful beings in the world. And his secondary objective, he noted in his head, *eliminating* the enemy Magus.
""The incantation is not done. The gas will return!""
William blind-fired again as he watched a soldier's head on his left disappear into nothing. The enemy Magus was moving forward with the attack, ready and able with destruction magic. ""Can you fight?"" He ducked his head.
The Magus' eyes enlarged. His hands dug into his cloak and pulled out a vial filled with a red liquid. In a moment, he popped the top off and drank the whole thing. ""I can.""
""Good,"" William looked around. He could almost hear the German's footsteps. ""On my mark,"" he said and held up his hand. He waited as the gunfire died down and the Germans approached.
The spoke in their own language and William wondered what they were shouting over the trench. He surmised it was similar to what he would have been shouting. They needed a confirmed Magus kill. William reloaded his rifle carefully, as to make less noise, he knew they wouldn't get one today.
He waited a few more moments, the tense air around him spoke great lengths. His soldiers were dirty, tired, hungry, and needed a good morale boost. Taking the enemy Magus and mounting his head would be a good start to boosting that morale. The German's food and much-better built trenches would be even better.
He heard a few buckets clang over head. It meant only one thing, the German's had approached *their* kill zone. He clenched his hand in a fist and then rushed over the trench. ""Go! Go! G --""
The gunfire drowned out his words as he and his platoon lunged upwards and opened fire on the German's in front of him. Yet, as he quickly realized, there were only a few Germans in his field of view, all of which hit the ground as they dove over the trenches.
Instead, he and his platoon were trapped in the enemy Magus' sights, who was rolling in on a large, armored troop transport. His hands were flying over his head in rapid motions and a squad of elite German troopers hung loosely on the side. The gunfire died down as everyone realized the gravity of the situation. William's eyes drifted towards his own Magus, who was now, again, readying a yellow aura in his hands.
It was up to the Magus, William knew that, to defend himself and the King's army from destruction. He was almost done and the Magus let loose his hands above him.
William was closest and the first to be wrapped in the yellow aura, but just as he was, the enemy Magus released his own red aura, which erupted in a flash of light. The two bounced against each other, Magus powers intertwining and wrapped both friend and foe in aura's of death and protection. The yellow and red mixed together, binding destructive and restorative power together in something that William had never seen before.
The ensuing blast from the two powers combining knocked him to his feet.
He felt that it must have been hours before he came to--in truth it was only a few minutes--and he carefully lifted his head upwards from the mud and dirt. In front of him, the armored transport was turned over and four or five Germans laid dead next to it. In front of that, William counted at least a dozen British soldiers overturned, mangled, or completely decimated. He could hear voices, noises that approached him, yet the enemy Magus was nowhere to be seen.
Then he turned his body onto his side and felt the sharpness of a tree stump in his left abdomen. He looked down at the wound, saw the blood on his shirt, and cursed himself. His eyes refocused to the battlefield and in front of him, he saw the enemy Magus grabbing the vials from the King's Magus. The German wore dark cloaks and dumped the vials into a bag on his shoulder, before looking at William.
He said something and then stepped atop the Magus' corpse and walked over to William. He spoke in some language, spun his fingers in his hand and brought forth an aura that glowed red.
William looked upwards at him and grabbed his abdomen. He only spoke a few soft words, ""Long live the King.""

"I made myself look out the window again. Through the light drizzle I can still see him standing there, under the dim red glow of the streetlamp. He hadn't moved, and he's still looking. Letting the curtain fall back into place, I slouched back into my chair.
He couldn't possibly know. That would be impossible. Although...my gaze shifted to the stack of plane, train and bus tickets on my table. One ways, all of them, and all in the last 6 months. Some from far off places, Russia, Hawaii, Prague; others from closer, Manchester, France. All from before I'd learnt how to get home, when I didn't know what was happening to me. Maybe I'd attracted some attention, coming back from all over the globe, but never going? Does the government keep tracks on that? No. Of course not. Who would care?
He'd been following me to and from work for the past week now, I was sure of that. I'd thought it better than to start appearing inside work, just in case. But every time I got off the tube, I'd see him: in the next carriage, on the opposite platform, walking past. I wasn't sure it was the same person. But now he was outside my house.
I took a glance through the curtains, hoping with all my might that he had gone, that I was being paranoid, that he just happened to be around me. He hadn't gone. He was still just standing there, his arm at a perfect right angle holding up his black umbrella. I stared, trying to make out features, trying to come up with a reasonable explanation as to who he could be, what he could want, and why he was following me.
Then he vanished.",0
"She stood on the platform. Behind her was the image of plenty, the lush island, singing out silently to the 49 pairs of eyes trained on it. The hologram shimmered as it swooped over the sea, dotted with coral reefs, the white-sanded beaches, people walking along the neatly groomed paths. An image of promise. Somehow this paradise existed. Was it an island of heaven? Was it an illusion?
It was really there, though. They could see it on maps of the world and satellite images. If you were lucky, you could see it from the window of an airplane. The 49 had whizzed under it in a submarine. No one knew its name. They referred to it simply as ""the island"". Its name was a privilege.
The video shifted, and a spotlight was trained on the woman with the blue-black hair and the violet eyes who stood before an ivory podium studded with jewels. She came from the island. You could tell by her clothes, her bearing, and, if you looked closely, a tattoo depicting a constellation on her collarbone. Orion, the hunter. 13 people knew this constellation by name.
""You, 49 champions, chosen from 49 cities across the land. Consider yourself privileged. This opportunity is priceless. You, of course, know this, or you wouldn't be here.""
People swallowed and shifted in their seats. The memories of cheating and defeating friends, family members, enemies were still fresh.
""Call me Glory. This is not my real name, of course. You will learn this, and the name of the island 7 of you will call home, when you make it through Lechoix. Lechoix is the real name of this city, by the way."" She allowed herself a small smile. ""It is designed to filter those who deserve the island from those who do not. How? There are so many ways. Most of you will not make it out. Know that this is what you really deserve. The island is incomprehensible to those who have not come out of this trial successfully. To let you through would kill you.""
How? they asked in their minds.
""Initially, the teams, 7 teams of 7, were referred to by colors. It began to be difficult to distinguish islanders from different years. So every year, we have assigned a different theme. My year was constellations. I was part of Orion. And I passed.""
Her violet eyes shone with pride. The faces of the 49 were reflected in her embroidered sheath dress, which glittered with opportunity.
""Your year is gemstones. Each of you has been assigned to a team based on your specific ability shown in your initial placement tests. Each team is well-rounded. At first, teamwork will be essential. But later, as teams dissolve, you may form new ones. Protocol for this will be explained while you are in Lechoix. The seven teams of this year are Sapphire, Tourmaline, Ruby, Opal, Lapis Lazuli, Iolite, and Emerald. Here are the team formations.""
The names and faces of each of the 49 appeared under headers.
They eyed up their competition, the ones who inspired envy from their appearances and their reputation. Iris Loughty, Opal, the girl whose face betrayed nothing. Penn Martin, Lapis Lazuli, the man with the fairytale good looks. Anshul Smith, with the weird name and weirder lime green eyes, Tourmaline. And the pink-haired one they were all curious about. It was probably Hanna something, most of them reasoned. Anyway, she was Iolite.
The four of them had remarkably similar mindsets. Iris was still, but her mind was spinning. Hanna imagined getting to the other side, no matter what she had to do.
Seven doors opened up, pictures of the gemstones shimmering on the screens above them.
""You will all be given currency to shop for supplies initially. Dressing rooms will be provided. When time is up, you will be released into the city. I would say good luck, but you create your own luck. I will be checking up on each team. Thank you.""
The room went dark, and the borders of the doors glowed white. Music pumped through hidden speakers. It was downbeat electronica. Was it to intimidate them?",0
"""Thomas."" The man in the tie looked up from behind his glasses at the man in front of him.
""That is correct."" A slow deliberate nod.
""Thomas, these credentials are from before...are outdated,"" He let out a small sigh. ""We can only evaluate you on recent and relevant material. But they fall within an entirely disparate field to what we do here.""
Thomas blinked, stoic. ""Again, Mr. Evans, sir, I believe they are relevant. As you can see on my resume, I have efficaciously worked with massive loads of clerical information relevant to finances and accounts. I've collated statistics of clientele, used to make major decisions. I've overlooked the outflow of resources for shifting capital and cooperating with smaller businesses and suppliers. Surely, these skills are exactly relevant, yes?"" He blinked again.
Evans shifted his tie and scratched his nose. ""Thomas, I understand that, but as it is now, you have not shown an aptitude to perform to that level of quality in a recent context. We cannot really afford to to take risks like that."" Evans looked at Thomas again.
Thomas fingers tightened around his wrist. He stared downwards at his hand, pensive. ""Risks?"" His mouth was dry. ""I see. Risks. Yes. You believe to understand risk, then? You understand that progress comes from risk, yes? Mr. Evans.""
Evans offered a melancholy smile. ""I'm sorry.""
""As am I. I am sorry that these sorts of experiences are what people must go through often. Regret. Yes, I feel regret. I had a place, but an intellectual curiosity I could not ignore became tangible. Being in this place and time, I thought to sate this curiosity...I thought it would have appealed to me. But I feel...frustration. I feel limited, enslaved to physical perceptions and clouding....emotions? Dragging me this way and that, pushing me to do things that do not work out in my probabilistic favor. I *know* within a small margin of error, that I have the competencies for the job. Surely I might have lessened processing potential, but enough to aid you in your endeavors, and yet because I am not the *same* as you, I am ignored. Yes. So this is regret. This is what it's like."" Thomas blinked.
Evans slowly got up, shuffling towards the door. He offered a limp handshake as Thomas left the room. ""Have a good day, Thomas.""
Thomas glanced dispassionately at him. ""Is that up to me?"" He walked out.",0
"The sky was cloudy. It was a good sky. This meant the drones wouldn't be out hunting his friends. Abdul mustered up the courage to ride farther out into the desert than usual. Even though the sky was cloudy, there was still the possibility of getting blown to bits by the ghosts in the sky. Through the biting winds and blinding clouds of sand he rode until he spotted something that caught his eye.
Something shiny was stuck in the middle of the sand. For some reason, it shined even though the sun wasn't out. Almost as if it was calling to Abdul, beckoning him to it. He rode towards the object and got so close that the light almost scared his horse and he held tight on its mane else he'd fall off. ""Praise Allah,"" he said to himself. It was a lamp. Its bright light had gone away and he picked it up out of the clutches of the sand dunes. For some reason, there was a bit of dust on it. He rubbed it on his clothes to make it shine again.
Suddenly, a giant plume of blue smoke rose from the tip of the lamp and swallowed Abdul. He panicked and began firing his rifle. His horse, scared from the smoke, threw him off and ran away deeper into the desert. He started screaming and cursing as he reloaded and fired his rifle some more into the blue smoke. Then a loud voice echoed in his skull and brought him to his knees. He covered his ears and stared in awe at the figure animating from the smoke.
""Heyyoooooooo!"" it screamed. ""Oh boy! 100 years will give you such a crick in the neck!"" the genie said twisting his head completely around his shoulders. Abdul screamed and scampered away backwards on his hands and feet. The genie turned towards him and vigorously shook his hand. ""Congratulations, buddy! You are our lucky contestant today in our popular new game show: Who Wants Three Wishes!"" The last words appeared in colorful letters in front of Abdul. His eyes were as wide as oasis pools. ""First things first, buddy, what's your name?"" A microphone appeared out of nowhere and the genie shoved it in front of his face.
""Uh, Abdul?"" he stuttered.
""Congratulations, Abe! You have just won Three Whole Wishes! Anything your heart desires can be yours with just a few spoken words,"" the genie said as he showed Abdul his wildest fantasies within his mind through blue smoke and water. ""Now, here are some ground rules. Number one: I can't kill anyone,"" the genies said removing his own head, ""so don't ask. Rule two: I can't bring anyone back from the dead,"" the genie said as a rotting zombie, ""it's not pretty, man! Finally, Rule three: I can't make anyone fall in love with you,"" the genie said turning his head into a giant pair of lips and smothering Abdul's head.
Abdul's face was red and he shoved the genie away from him. ""Enough! There will be none of this comedic nonsense!"" he screamed. The genie was confused; usually people liked his routine. ""I am Abdul, one of the glorious leaders of the mighty ISIS army! No one shall command me and no one shall live in sin under my rule,"" he proudly proclaimed in front of the genie.
'Great,' the genie thought, 'another nut job. Why can't I get anyone normal for a change? Well, might as well toy with this one too.' The genie smiled and bowed his head. ""Pleasure to meet you, Abe!""
""Abdul!""
""Whatever. Listen, I'm here to serve your needs. Your wish is literally my command. Where would you like to start?""
Abdul thought about this for a minute. Anything his heart desired? Why not indulge himself with a reward for finding such a magnificent weapon against his enemies? He clapped his hands twice, ""Genie, I wish for one hundred virgin wives. Now!""
""It is as good as done!"" Genie snapped his fingers and in a giant cloud of blue smoke appeared one hundred women wearing hijabs. ""There you go, one hundred virgin wives!""
Abdul panted like a Pavlovian dog as he chose which wife he wanted to start with. He chose the first one he saw. He grabbed her arm and stared into here eyes. ""You and I will return to my home at once and make glorious children to continue my bloodline.""
She screamed and pulled her arm from his grip. She yelled something in a language Abdul did not understand. The other women heard her and removed their hijabs. One hundred beautiful, Russian UFC fighters charged at Abdul and left him broken, beaten, and scarred. The crowd of women let out their battle cry and charged towards the city. Abdul's pain kept him from moving an inch.
""Oh, sorry Abe,"" Genie said, ""I didn't know what kind of women you were into."" He lifted him up against his will. ""How about we try again? Got anything in mind?""
Abdul let out a frustrating groan and stared daggers at the genie. ""You pathetic worm. Fine, I wish for the Western World to be destroyed! Now, no one will fall under their evil influence and they will follow Allah's true way of living."" He smiled deviously at the genie.
""Consider it done, Abe."" Genie snapped his fingers.
Abdul looked around and waited for something to happen, but nothing did. He didn't know what to expect. ""Well, did you destroy it or not?""
""Sure I did!"" Genie said pulling a newspaper out of thin air. ""Look, see? Westworld is officially cancelled! That's what you wanted right?""
Abdul screamed into the cloudy desert sky. He started yelling numerous curses and insults at the genie while he tried his best not to laugh. Abdul pulled himself on to his almost broken ankles and slammed his fists against the ground. He started screaming prayers, ""Allah, why have you done this to me?"" Just then, he heard gunfire in the distance. Explosions rose from the hills east of the town and more gunfire was heard. ""What is that? What did you do?"" he asked the genie.
""Oh yeah,"" Genie said rubbing his chin, ""I forgot to mention that the hundred wives you asked for were combat trained by the best soldiers in the world."" He pulled a spyglass out of this air and pointed it at the battle going on in the hills. Genie whistled, ""Looks like they did not take kindly to your friends.""
Abdul watched in horror as his friends were being massacred in the hills. ""NO! Make them stop at once!""
""I don't think you want to waste your last wish,"" Genie said in singsong.
Abdul clenched his teeth and growled. ""Fine you miserable, disgusting, filthy, sinful, swine! Here is my last wish: I want a legion of the most loyal ISIS soldiers!"" Now Abdul would have his revenge by taking his newly formed legion and wiping out anyone who stood in his way.
""Are you sure you want that?"" Genie asked.
""Yes.""
""Are you really sure you want that?""
""Yes!""
""Are you really really really sure you want to use those wor-""
""YES! YES! YES! I know what I want you disgusting subhuman creature! Now make it happen, now!"" Abdul stomped the ground on the last words.
""Okay, here you go,"" Genie snapped his fingers, ""an entire legion of the most loyal ISIS soldiers!"" The desert before Abdul was filled with soldiers dressed in ISIS uniform.
Abdul had him beat. He laughed as his stood on his almost broken ankles and raised his fist to his new army. ""Allahu Akbar!"" The soldiers in his army removed their coats and raised their fists high in the air. Abdul saw that they were holding something in their hands. When he realized what they were, his heart sank and a cold chill washed down his spine. ""Wha-""
""What's wrong, Abe?"" Genie asked. ""This is what you asked for, right? A legion of the most loyal ISIS soldiers ready to die for the glory of Allah."" Genie looked at the horrified expression on Abdul's face and felt satisfied on another job well done. ""Ohhh I'm so sorry it looks like your wish limit has been exhausted,"" Genie said as he printed out an incredibly long receipt. ""Here's my bill sorry I couldn't stay longer and you have a nice day. Bye!"" With that he disappeared back into his lamp in a cloud of blue smoke.
The legion of soldiers let out their battle cry, ""Allahu Akbar!"" and detonated the vests on their bodies destroying themselves, Abdul, and a large piece of desert just outside the city.

"*Haven't read nor watched American Psycho, but I'll give it a shot. *
There is something beautiful about watching a grown man weep.
Tears, you see, are one of the most beautiful things that God ever blessed us with. To many, they are only water and salt, but they tell all kinds of fascinating stories: years of memories; honest words that left an impact; cruel belts that also left an impact; a single rush of frustration, of helplessness, of soul-crushing despair.
People will talk about happy tears. They will say that they cry out of joy, or because something is beautiful, or because it has profoundly affected their soul forever.
These people are lying. There are no happy tears. When people claim they are tears of joy, because something else is beautiful, they do not tell the truth. They are tears of envy, because they know they will never have something as beautiful.
I have made over 25 grown men weep in the last two weeks. I find it very gratifying, to make them understand that they are awful, terrible people who cannot be helped, while at that same time listening to them tell me how I have been such a big help.
I don't do much, really. I simply sit in the chair, like some sort of doctor, and poke and prod and pinch until they tell me where it hurts. Then I poke and prod even more until they scream and weep for mercy from their own sins.
You see, I pretend to help these people. They come to my office, and I let them reveal themselves to me, get them to tell me their secrets, their fears, their deepest insecurities.
And then I exploit them. I break them down, and they do not even realize it is happening.
I love my job. People say that sick people see psychologists, and even sicker people become them. Maybe they are right, who knows?
I realize that you must think I am a terrible person for this, but I assure you that I am not. I am only helping to contribute more beauty to the world.
Water and salt. And beauty. That is what I bring to the world.
I hope you can say that you've done something as important.",0
"Status Report: ADM
Recipient: EVE
STATUS: ENCRYPTED
I hate this. I've experienced loathing, I've experienced anger, distaste, disdain, dislike, but this is...terrible, to say the least. It felt strange, peculiar, to complete all actions that a human would within twenty-four hours.
I was given a perfect clone for my body. Chris Evans, a famous celebrity. I was told to ""work out"" via exercises to form microscopic tears in my muscle tissue so that it would heal and make me stronger, cell by cell. My eyes are perfect, a pair of 20/20 eyes, but inferior to my former gigapixel cameras. My hair has yet to grow, although being bald will not be an issue.
Expelling waste was no problem. The clean-up afterwards was...less than savory. I wasn't sure if I wiped fully, nor was I completely sure that my urethra was completely devoid of urin. I disliked the uncertainty I was faced with. Whenever I was faced with uncertainty, all I had to do was to reboot myself. But in this case, with a human body...only the advanced toilet could tell me that I ""was in the clear.""
My skin feels...strange. I cannot help but notice how many items I'm touching all at once. I cannot comprehend how any human can bear sitting in the same position for hours while perusing a computer, along with wearing clothes, feeling their socks, shoes...it is a new sensation, to be human.
I had some minor trouble putting on my clothes. By default, the body came with a pair of socks and underwear already on. I took care to notice which way the tag was facing when I put on my given polo shirt. A dark blue polo, with a small caricature of a jockey atop a horse, just over the left lung. I then put on a pair of jeans, with the back pockets just over my buttocks. My wallet was given to me by Bank of America, with a credit card, a credit score of exactly 700 within my account, and exactly five hundred dollars in cash - ten $1 bills, fifteen $5 bills in the wallet itself, and the rest in my safe. I deposited my card and all bills (except the $1 bills) into the safe. I was told to not divulge the safe passcode.
I ventured out into the open world. A 7/11 store was nearby, and I cautiously proceeded to look left and right, to make sure my body is not compromised or destroyed. I purchased a Mars candy bar. I then proceeded back to my apartment, repeating cautionary steps to ensure that I live a bit longer.
I spent the rest of the day sorting my wardrobe by type and color, as well as hue. Human society has gifted me the body, and gifted me the clothes. No reason to not treat the clothes with caution. What sorts of other secrets would clothes hold? Just as I learned waste expulsion is not what it seemed, clothes would yield more untold secrets later on. I am certain of such.
I want my old body back, where I need only think of retrieving something to get it, where I have my own eyes, my own ears, and maintenance crews to fix me, without foreign contaminants, nor feelings. Feelings only compromise me and my decisions, make me biased. I suppose such flawed thinking makes humans who they are. I have the option to leave the body if I wished.
I will now indulge in ""sleep."" I have set my alarm to activate at seven in the morning.
I was told once, by my late creator, to know my enemies better than my friends. I suppose this is the first step.
EVE. Do not under any circumstances accept a body.

"From the very walls he came, invading my home. When I awoke this morning I didn't know I would be fighting for my life, all to keep him away from what I was sworn to protect. I wasn't prepared the injuries, god the injuries, I don't know how much longer I can hold off this invader, how much longer I can survive, I can barely move. He turned my house into a weapon, riddled with cruel traps of his design. Where did he even get explosives, how'd he learn to maneuver my home better than I ever could? I can hardly get a good look at him, he managed to turn every pursuit, every capture, every time I thought I was near victory into another opportunity to destroy a part of me, staying only long enough to gleefully carry out his punishment.

"""It's a balancing act, you see, Senator."" I couldn't actually understand what he was saying at this point. I heard him, sure, but the smartly dressed man from what he called ""Section '76"" absolutely had to be lying. There was no possible way.
At least, that's what I thought until I saw them a moment later after being lead through a massive vault door that hissed and clanked as it open. And there they were--attached to giant turbines that hummed with a mechanical ferocity.
""So you see, now, at least?"" the man said.
""Oh..."" I had to remember to breathe. ""Quite.""
With a grin, the man turned to me, ""You know at the beginning they didn't have enough specific impulse to get them running. We knew we could get them up to almost relativistic speeds, but we had to ramp them up gradually. These machines are so large an expensive that we had to tune them up relatively slowly.""
""So how did you do it?""
""Well it started with Kent state."" he began, gesturing back through the vault door where we wouldn't be deafened by the cacophony.
""Are you serious?""
""Oh, yes, Senator. We killed those kids.""
""JFK?""
""Yep."" He winced a little. ""That was definitely pushing the limits."" He quickly returned to smiling. ""Helped us defeat the Soviets though.""
It was hard to stomach. As much as the things they did were awful, there's no way we could have kept the country going without this massive amount of power. But there was still something missing. There's no way they could keep this secret if they told every congressman.
""You said something about a balancing act earlier?""
The man stopped walking and looked to me. ""So you are starting to understand. Good. Come this way.""
We changed directions down a different hall, and eventually came to a door with an unassuming door. He swiped his badge and placed his hand on a biometric scanner. The door clicked and swung open to the inside. He gestured for me to go first.
Inside the room there was just a table with some snacks and a thermos for coffee with a couch and two comfortable-looking chairs. ""Please, let's sit and talk.""
--------------
From the conversation that we had, it turned out that they really didn't have to do much at all. If the people who were making the presidents spin in their graves knew how much they were helping the country, then the presidents wouldn't spin as much. This, it turned out, was a covert operation--almost inception as much as it was espionage.
But there was also damage control as well, the machines could only handle so much spinning before they would have to be disconnected as to not break them. It has only happened twice and it resulted in national power outages. The repercussions of which were not easily dealt with.
""So why am I here?"" I finally asked, now knowing the scope of this operation and how delicate it was.
""Well, Senator, there's no real easy way to put this."" He paused for a moment and rubbed what had become a five o'clock shadow.
""You're a very up-and coming figure in US politics. Quite influential. Many people like you and your record is spotless. The old men really like what you're doing.""
A pit formed in my stomach. The room started to spin.
""It's a balancing act, you see? We have enemies, Senator.""
Vision gone, sounds muffled...
""They must continue to spin...
I do hope you understand.""",0
"""It's time for our chat."" Death dictated towards the horrified man kneeling before him, as his pager periodically buzzed.
Although this was not uncommon, with an average of one and a half millions deaths per day, the damn thing seemed to always be buzzing.
At an average seventeen deaths per second it would be impossible for any mortal to accomplish Death's job. However as a middleman for the gods death simply bent time, not unlike how mortals preceive time in their dreams, so in one second Death could have a five minute chat with every client.
With his gaze still fixated on this man kneeling before him
Death asked,
""What might your name be?""
Not that he didn't already know it. As it and every other detail about this man was displayed before Death on the clipboard he held in his hand opposite the hand with his scythe.
As his pager buzzed again Death ignored it and stated.
""It says here you were president, in your mortal life that is.""
To which the petrified man still had no response.
Now this was not the average conversation Death had with his clients. It was usually a more intimidating and condescending approach. In a frightful manner to have the client confess all there wrong doings and determine their end destination from there.
But with his omniscient point of view on the mortal world Death had taken a particular interest in this human. Specifically because of a certain weapon placed under This man's control. A weapon Death often fantasized about they day they would be used, as he took much joy in preforming his job.
As his pager continued to buzz Death apologized saying,
""Sorry, this isn't usually for this thing to be going off so much, as it only buzzes when people die. "",
""I'll let you get your thoughts in order as I step out to be filled in on a situation. "",
""Please don't leave as I anxiously await our conversation, not that you can leave even if you tried.""
Finally the man's attention was caught as he heard Death say, ""...it only buzzes when people die."" As the man looks up and watches death leave the room his face goes pail with an overwhelming expression of regret filling his face.
The next five minutes, and the last of the man's, life were spend muttering to himself,
""It was my only option."" Over and over again.
As he awaited Death's return. Floating back into the dark room beaming with a sense of delight. Death took one final look at the man right before vanquishing him to his final destination with his scythe and said,
""That explains your suicide, I'm so glad you used them. No need for our chat now...I know exactly where to send you.""",0
"""....Now to just fix that semicolon, carry the one, add in the null set...and...Eureka! I've done it! I've proven God's existence!""
*A shadowy figure, who had been lurking in the corner for the last five minutes, clapped slowly for about 7.6 seconds, give or take. *
""Hello John. I hear that you've discovered proof of the existence of God,"" said the shadowy figure.
""Indeed I have! This is a momentous occasion!"" John exclaimed. He had been working on this proof for years.
""I'm going to have to ask you to destroy it.""
""Like hell I will.""
""Indeed. Satan discovered proof of my existence too, and look what that got him."" The shadowy figure stepped into the light. Gaudily bright white clothes sparkled in the dimly lit room. This guy had the figure of a septuagenarian marathon runner and a beard to rival the first Albus Dumbledore.
""Cosplaying as God, I take it?""
""You've discovered proof of my existence, I mysteriously popped out of a corner, and you've told nobody about this yet. For a genius, you're a fool.""
""While I have proven God's existence, you are not him.""
""I can make the whole planet rain for 40 days if you like.""
""I bet you can.""
""I'm not kidding.""
""I don't doubt it.""
""I have unbelievable powers.""
""I don't doubt it.""
""Your password is hunter42.""
That took John by surprise, as he didn't know that you could pronounce asterisks that way. Surely this being was powerful and knowledgeable.
""I know. Look 'God,' you may be more powerful than me. You may be more factually retentive than I am. But the fact of the matter is that not only did I discover proof of God's existence, but I discovered against your wishes.""
""Fine. The jig is up. I'm neither all-powerful nor all-knowing. But you're giving me that proof.""
""No.""
""No?!""
""I've proven an omniscient, omnipotent God. You may be a powerful alien, but you aren't God.""
John thought for just a second more.
""Besides, If you were able to stop me, you wouldn't be asking.""
The glimmering figure, seeing that all hope in the conversation was lost, materialized a green portal and walked away.
""You make a good point, John. Goodbye then.""

"Ted entered the life office and walked up to the front desk. The 19 year old secretary was ignoring him to face time here soul mate.
""No I love you more"" she said
""No I love you more"" he said
""No I love you more"" she said
Ted rang the bell.
""No I love you more"" he said
""No I love you more"" she said
""No I love you more"" he said
Ted rang the bell.
""No I love you more"" she said
""No I love you more"" he said
""No I love you more"" she said
Ted rang the bell repeatedly.
""No I love you more"" he said, speaking louder
""No I love you more"" she said, also speaking louder
Ted picked up the bell and started slamming it into the desk.
""Sorry I have to work"" she said
""Finally"" said Ted
""You hang up first"" he said
""No you hang up first"" she said
""Oh for fuck's sake""
""No you hang up first"" he said
""I'm going in""
Ted walked past the secretary and into the office of the 21 year old CEO of Life Indsutries. He was face timing his soul mate.
""I love you the most"" said the CEO
""No I love you the most"" said his soul mate
""No I love you the most"" said the CEO
Ted stewed in silence.
""No I love you the most"" said his soul mate
""No I love you the most"" said the CEO
""No I love you the most"" said his soul mate
""Sorry babe, gotta go, I've got a customer""
Ted's spirits rose.
""You hang up first"" said his soul mate
And came crashing back down.
""No you hang up first"" said the CEO
""No you hang up first"" said his soul mate
""No you hang up first"" said the CEO
""Ok"" his soul mate hung up.
The CEO looked at his phone and laughed.
""What a kidder"" he said, then to Ted ""What can I do for you""
""Hi, I got my manual for living a long and happy life""
The FaceTime ring tone emanated from the phone.
""No you hang up first"" said his soul mate
""No you…""
Ted leaned across the table, ended the call and held out the open book.
""It just says give'er"" said Ted
""Hm"" said the CEO, taking the book and leafing through page after page that had give'er written in big, bold letters in the middle ""This one doesn't just say give'er""
Ted took the book back and read the page. He let the his arms drop to his waist.
""Yeah"" said Ted, turning the book to the CEO ""because instead it says 'just give'er""
""Well have you tried it?""
""What?""
""Giving 'er""
""No because I don't know what that means""
""Well it means to…you know…give'er""
""Give her what?""
""No no no give'er…like give'er""
""You've just made it less clear""
""Well you know how you haven't been giving 'er? Well now start giving 'er""
""Stop fucking talking and give me another book""
The phone started ringing again. The CEO reached for it but Ted got it first. He flung it across the room where it shattered against the wall. The CEO looked at the broken phone, then back to Ted. He pulled open a drawer and took out another phone, which he put on his desk. The CEO stared at it for a second, adjusted it a centimetre to the left then looked at Ted.
""I'm afraid we can't""
""Why?""
""Every book is personalized. If we gave you a book someone would go without one""
""I'm going without one""
The CEO furrowed his brow ""You have one though""
""A fucking useless one""
""I think it's solid advice""
""You think give'er is solid advice?""
""Yeah. Look at me, I'm 21 I'm a CEO, I've met my soul mate…""
On cue the phone started ringing. Ted picked it up and tossed it over his head. It landed in the water pitcher by the door.
""And if I could sum up what I did down to one word"" The CEO looked down nonchalantly, opened the drawer, took out another phone, put it on the desk and looked up at Ted ""That word would be give'er""
""That's two words""
""Is it?""
""Yes""
""Is it""
""What the fuck is wrong with you people""
""Nothing, because we followed our manuals, just like you should""
""But it just says give'er""
""Now you've got it""
The phone buzzed. The CEO picked it up and held it to his ear.
""Uh-huh?"" he turned the phone slightly, angling it away from his ear towards Ted so he could clearly see that the caller ID had identified the caller as 'bae' ""Work stuff, I have to take it""
Ted turned around, his book dangling from his finger tips, and walked out of the office, numb to everything.
""No you hang up first"" said the CEO
Ted walked into the reception area.
""No I love you more"" said the receptionist.
Ted walked by her desk.
""Thank you for coming, No I love you more""
Ted left the building and walked into the alley where a hobo was standing over a trash can fire.
""Hello"" said the hobo
""How are you homeless?""
""I have no house""
""No I mean, didn't you get a manual?""
""Sure did. Best advice I ever got""
""Really?""
""I couldn't imagine being happier""
Ted looked at him funny. A female hobo stuck her head out from their semi-detached cardboard and newspaper bungalow.
""There she is"" said the hobo
""There he is"" said the female hobo
""There she is"" said the hobo
The hobo walked into the semi detached and started having loud sex with his hobo wife. Ted at the garbage can fire, holding his book, the sounds of hobo love making drowned out by the buzzing in his head.
The book teetered on the edge of his fingers and just before it fell he pulled it back. Ted sighed, looked over his shoulder at the rocking cardboard box and then went off to figure out how to give'er.",0
"""Do you sometimes think of Dshangris Liksandr?"" the question hit Samu out of the blue and ripped him out of various thoughts.
""Not really, Mika. He was that person whose watch failed, right?""
Mika looked old enough to be in retirement, but still came steadfastly to each of his shifts in the Immigration Office. Samu assumed that he lost quite a Euro in the last financial crisis and worked because he prefered working over starving. His voice however sounded used to authority, to ordering people around. ""Yep, Immigrant out of...one of the stans...you know the area of what used to be Russia, I remember that you were on shift when he got his watch. You had to translate for him because his German was that bad. I still remember this.""
Samu was middle-age, wore thick glasses and had recently taken up shaving his head to disguise his receding hairline. His voice sounded dispassionate - unless someone got ihm to talk about his family. ""I translate for a lot of immigrants, I can't remember them all.""
""But he was special. His watch showed Error.""
""Error? Yeah, these things fail occasionally.""
Mika made it clear that this sugestion was one of the dumbest things he heard in a while. ""I replaced the watch thrice and it still did. Each of the watches did.""
""So? You wonder what he is doing?"" Samu asked, wondering again why he had to share an office with Mika.
""Yeah. I mean, it is quite mysterious, isn't it?""
""Maybe...I don't know...You know that my memory is like my car.""
""You have a car?""
""No, that's the joke.""
""Oh...well, to me, it is. I imagine him still being around,...and sometimes...sometimes, I imagine that the watch showed Error because fate did not want him to die."" Mika's voice was quiet, it was clear that he was disclosing something he did not tell others. ""I don't have a lot of time left, but, you know, this thing never left my mind.""
""I see."" Samu thought about this for a while. ""You know, I will do a bit of research on this topic. Tell me what you remember, please.""
The next day, Mika Grubenbauer was dead found in his office, clutching a folder of documents. Most of the documents detailed the life of an immigrant up to his death in a train crash. The last page showed a report about a product recall about a certain charge of watches - produced shortly before said immigrant came into the first world.",0

"""So...let me be clear."" Obama said for perhaps the last time as President.
""I congratulate President-Elect Sanders on his..."" Obama paused as a crackle of lightning appeared in the air. The audience murmured as more crackles began to form. All at once, a blinding flash of light followed by a WHUMPH sound revealed a floating DeLorean. Someone had stolen the top secret Time Machine from Area 51!
President-Elect Sanders gaped in horror as the driver's door popped open on the DeLorean and he saw...himself.
The Sanders from the Delorean jumped out and ran to the podium.
""Listen to me, all of you!"" Don't institute ANY of my ideas or policies! Socialism DOES NOT WORK! It didn't work before, and it won't work in the future!""
The Sanders at the podium ran overt to President-Elect Sanders, pulled out a black pistol and shot the President-Elect twice in the chest. A Secret Service agent instinctively shot the time traveler.
""Mission Accomplished!"" The Time Traveling Sanders said as he died.

"""How many times are we going to have to tell Tommy not to put the cat in the oven?"" James felt like this wasn't a question most father's had to ask, even rhetorically.
""He just loves the combination I guess. Maybe he thinks the cat lives there somehow,"" Mary replied. She was brushing Sherlock, the cat, on the counter while Tommy was off in the living room enjoying his favorite show.
""Maybe putting something else in there would help break that connection...what about putting his train or Mr.Lambo in the oven?""
""You can't put a stuffed koala in the oven, even if it is off. Can you imagine how gross it would get?"" Mary asked. ""We can try the train, it should be up in his room.""
""Okay, I'll grab it, then we can pause the television and get Tommy to open the oven- and voila- he's cured,"" James said. He walked up the beige carpeted stairs, running his hand on the fake oak rail and watching the second floor get closer and closer as the beige walls came to an end. Tommy's room was on the right, complete with a wall decal of trains, and a treasure chest of toys stuffed to the brim. The train was right in the center of his bed, James grabbed it.
Stumbling down the stairs two at a time, James started to make train noises as he drove the toy towards Tommy. The boy turned to his father, grasping at the train. ""Follow me if you want the train, Tommy,"" James said, making his way into the kitchen. He tossed the toy train to Mary who promptly put it on the first rack in the oven. Tommy arrived in the kitchen seconds later.
""Where is it, daddy?"" He asked.
""In his real home, right over there,"" James said pointing at the oven. Mary stood to the side of the oven in her beautiful blue dress and beige shoes. Tommy walked over and looked around the cabinets. No train there. He checked the trash. The oven dinged, Mary and James looked at one another but decided on shrugging.
Tommy finally checked the oven and pulled out two trains. His smile was bigger than it had been minutes before. The boy was in train heaven, choo-chooing back to his television show. ""Okay, what was that?"" James asked.
""I don't know...I only put the one in. We haven't done this before have we? Certainly not more recently than when we last used the oven.""
""No, this was a new idea. But the oven is new too, straight from the new appliance division of LG."" As James finished speaking, a second cat, identical to the first, walked past them. The other cat was still sitting on the counter, swatting its tail back and forth.

"It always puzzled me, to say the least, and made me extremely nervous.
As such I never committed into relationships, probably by great of having my feelings not reciprocated.
My longest relationship was with a man I loved deeply, Indy. He was the complete opposite of me: extraverted, charming, outgoing. He was friend with everyone, but still reliable and generous.
We stayed together for a couple of years, and, I don't know why, but it really seemed like he had feelings for me.
But like I did in other relationships before, I shut him down, rejecting him when I felt my feelings growing to much.
In the end he left me, like they all did. I learned later that he was with Kelly, a girl we met a couple of time when we were together.
I met other men and women, and it always ended the same way.
Fast forward to yesterday. Kelly calls me, saying that Indy was in the hospital, after being hit by a car. His condition was critical, and he has asked for me.
And here I am, a bouquet of flowers in hands, nervously looking for room 68.
I find it, half opened, and take a deep breath to give myself courage, and here Indy's weak voice.
""Kelly, you're...a wonderful girl but...I...I...I never loved you.""
The words hit me like a punch. I storm in the room, but his eyes are already closed. Forever.",0
"*France, Russia, China. India, and even North Korea. *
*What do all those countries have in common, you ask? Their leaders owe us a favour. Today, we cash in. All hail the Queen. *
Hollande, Putin, Xiaoping, Modi and Jong-Un knelt at my feet. All were quivering. How strange. Then again, they didn't have their little suitcases of death.
""Pledge your loyalty to the Queen or face your country being nuked and uninhabitable for the next millennium. I have gravity missiles hovering over each and every square inch of all your countries. Choose wisely.""
Little Kim was the first one to rise.
""No-"", he began.
I cut him off.
""Launch the nukes and missiles for Pyongyang. You know that South Korea will blame you for the collateral damage, right? Someone bring Kim a screen so he can watch his little country go down in flames.""
Obama rose.
""How can you destroy us without destroying Canada as well? I object.""
""I am targeting the southern part of America. Damage should spread to the northern part. If it doesn't, I have others locked onto the middle. Here, watch.""
I saw a message flash on the screen: **North Korea destroyed**, it read.
""You mother-"", Kim started
I ended him with a.50 to his head.
""Hey Barack, you think South Korea's going to blame you? You're the only country that really hates North Korea.""
**USA destroyed**
""You know that-""
*Bang*. Obama down and out.
Putin seemed to be conferring with Hollande, Xiaoping and Modi.
""Gentlemen?""
""You leave us no choice. We pledge our allegiance. "", Putin called out in surrender. I could hear a hint of loss and sadness in his voice.
""Good. Let the celebrations begin.""",0
"""Say it. Out loud."" I'm clutching my shopping bags to my chest as I scramble to rack my brain for answers. I don't want to say the wrong thing, I mean this is Satan here, speaking of which I don't know exactly how I'm aware of this, I'm just going off that sharp, chilling feeling up my spine and the heavy atmosphere you only feel when you read something by Poe in English class. It's disorienting in the same way. You're somewhere mundane, somewhere you frequent fairly often, but its not until you're presented with these dark themes that the place seems surreal and you're left existentially mortified by your own mortality. He laughs. Satan laughs, and it takes me aback a bit, considering he has such a jolly, hearty tone.
""I'm fucking with you."" I breathe a sigh of relief.
""So I'm not ‘ interesting ’? Not peculiar in any way?""
""Oh, no, no you are. I was quoting Twilight back there. No, you're still interesting."" Shit. ""So you don't know then?""
""I haven't been made aware, no."" I lower my bags slightly, adjusting to the situation, deciding that perhaps I've been holding my breath too long and biting the inside of my lip too hard. I'm lightheaded and I taste blood. ""Is it bad?""
""Oh, its terrible. Truly horrible. Ghastly, really. You don't want to know."" Is he messing with me again? I can't tell, but that seems to be common with him. I mean, look at Eve, biting into the forbidden fruit. I've bitten in a similar way, chomping onto the bait he's offering, desperate to find out what's interesting about me, what's peculiar, what's wrong. But that's just my nature, really. Satan grins in one of those malicious ways that says ‘ I'm going to drive you to your wit's end before I reveal the answer ’.
""Walk with me, talk with me. Come on."" We begin to walk and I find it hard to keep up with his steady gait. ""What else did you need to pick up here?""
""…A suit?""
""Do you not own one?""
""I've grown out of it. I don't go to many occasions."" Satan snaps.
""Bam. Suit. Looks sharp."" I look down at myself and I'm head to toe in maroon and black fabric. Fits like a glove, or well, a suit.
""…Not to punch a gift horse in the mouth…""
""But?""
""I need more of a funeral vibe. For a funeral. You know. A dead relative suit.""
""Oh, I see, I see, my condolences.""
""Its fine.""
""May I ask whom?""
""My aunt.""
""Were you two close?""
""…I guess. We saw each other often.""
""…But?""
""Well I mean, she was kind of a bitch."" I wouldn't admit it to anyone else, but I mean, its Satan, I'm sure he understands badmouthing a dead relative.
""How so?""
""In every way imaginable.""
""And you're attending her funeral because…?"" He tilts his head a bit as he looks at me.
""I'm obligated to, aren't I? It'd make me look bad if I didn't. My mom would have a fit. Etc.""
""Ah. Always thinking about the well being of others, right?"" I groan.
""You have no damn idea.""
""Which brings me to what I had mentioned before. You're…pure. Like the virgin saint Mary. Near godly and what not."" I stop in place to shoot him an incredulous look. ""Which also aids in you being a doormat, and not on of those nice ones, either. The ones with the scratchy material that people rub their shit-soiled shoes into so they don't track it into the house."" Well he's not wrong about that bit. ""Tell me. You happy leading the life you do?""
""I'm about halfway between melancholy and miserable, so no, not particularly.""
""Tell you what. Keep the suit. I'll make arrangements so that you can skip out on this funeral without ruffling anyone's feathers. Now, you don't have to swear to anything right now, but let me ease up your situation, help you live a little bit. Then we can discuss any benefits further, and the payment according. Consider this your free trial, alright?"" I get a free trial to see if I want to sell my soul to the Dark Lord Satan. An interesting offer for an ‘ interesting'individual such as myself. I've got this twisting, sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach, the feeling you get as a kid when you sneak a book of your dad's matches to play with fire. I know I shouldn't, I know the harm, but…The temptation here is unreal. Again, seems to be Satan's MO.
""…Why me?""
""Reaping the souls of the innocent is what I do. The more innocent, the more valuable, the more I'm willing to meet you halfway, if not more."" His words make sense but I'm still left in a daze. ""I'll give you six days of whatever the Hell you want. Pun fully intended. We'll chat about details at a later date."" He's gone and I feel sick. I lug my bags to the food court, needing to sit down, needing a drink, maybe a ginger ale to settle my stomach. I pull a chair out to sit, and a large ginger ale appears in front of me. Nothing extravagant, nothing I'd sell my soul over, but highly convenient. I'm left wondering how I could go about these next six days. Do every drug imaginable without having to worry about dying or permanent damage? Enslave the people who have hurt me most? Kill a man? I find my mind going to very dark places, the product of being presented with such an opportunity. I'm deep in thought, sipping on a value size ginger ale in a suave suit in a mall on the sketchier side of town. I look out of place but it feels so right.
""Thanks, Satan.""

"I suddenly awoke with a start, eyes blinking rapidly in the dark. It took a while before my mind registered something sharp tapping against my foot but slowly, I got up onto my elbows and stared at the foot of my bed. Dark, bloody red eyes met mine and a sinister smile made its way across his malevolent face.
""Hey Lucifer,"" I sighed.
He let out a dark chuckle and gave one last sharp tap on my foot, making me wince slightly. It was time, I supposed. I expected it for a while, I just never knew exactly when but after being alive for over a thousand years, I guess I should've known this moment was coming.
""You're it,"" he breathes.
And then, gone.
I quietly groaned to myself and threw the sheets off, climbing out of bed. Once my feet were on the ground, I shuffled over to the mirror on the other side of the wall. Even without the light on, I could see my eyes changing. Darker and darker they became, until the brown in them had all but been replaced by color that resembled wine. I pulled my upper lip up and sure enough, my canines were beginning to elongate and sharpen.
I scratched the delicate points of my slowly forming horns.
Being the Devil was a hard job, definitely not something someone could handle alone.

"Who remembers the Armenians? The quotation was a favorite of John's, for many reasons. Firstly it served as a tool for him to understand his abilities, secondly it served as a warning of what he could do with them if he chose to.
John was just finishing up his first year of highschool and had already been elected class president as well as created a position of student representative for school-board meetings which he of course filled himself.
The school seemed to twist itself around his finger all of its own accord. He had a natural charisma and grace which people couldn't help but succumb to. He'd realized this ability early in the school year and decided to develop it fully, researching sociology, interrogation, deprogramming, and psychology. The natural aptitude he had for these subjects was put into practice as he laid the foundation for his little empire.
Hours of meeting with teachers and parents outside of classes, attending parties and hanging out with friends so as not to loose the student's support as he gained the adults. Eventually he had gained respect and recognition from both parties, and had a base of power from which to apply leverage.
Now he could plant ideas in the student body, a conversation here, a rumor there. The same techniques could be applied to the adults though with more subtlety. Slowly they would come to fruition and it would be suggested that it would of course be proper to arrange a meeting between their best and brightest students and the state senators, America's future leaders and all that.
A meeting here, a shaken hand, make an impression and hint at how difficult it must be to keep track of everything as a senator. Lead them to the idea of him as an aide. Gain a senator's ear and then you'll have power.
First the senator, then the congress.",0
"0:28, it was stuck on 28 seconds.
It was a strange coincidence, he was born on the 28th, but he couldn't even remember that right now. He had been waiting for this for some time now, a long time. The rest of the world was just passing by in a blur, when he first sat down on the bench. He tried to pay attention at first, observing who it could or couldn't be. He told himself he wouldn't discriminate. He wanted to keep race, age and gender out of it. What would be, would be.
Then in the blur of the crowd, he saw her. She was beautiful, in the truest sense of the word, she made the ages of waiting worth it. And she edged closer to him, time seemed to stop, as if Kronos himself was sending a sign. She looked up and met his eyes, and she smiled. That smile, he would soon cherish.
On his wrist, still 0:28.
He didn't care, it had to be her. Who said these things worked anyway? There were stories, rumours really, that people had forsaken the advice of the devices, and still found happiness. This was his chance. All his life he had followed, taking conventions from society as gospel. He had one shot, and he couldn't miss it.
He rose from the seat, but just as he did, he saw it coming. The car burst through his bubble, taking her with it. He froze.
He glanced at his timer.

"I sat down on my bed, watching the fatigued workers jostle through the crowd, mindlessly heading home. I say bed, but cardboard boxes aren't exactly the best memory foam mattress. A lady dropped some loose change into my bucket before heading her way, her heels clicking on the tiled floor. Snow speckled her ebony hair, just a taste of what was to come this winter. I sighed, gathering my blanket, or what was left of it, tightly around me. It'd be cold tonight, from the looks of it. Announcements blared over the speakers - not very effectively, I admit - not that it mattered to me. It must've been about some train, for the herd quickened their pace, shoving their way through down to the platform. A well-dressed man tripped over my blanket, murmuring a quick (and insincere) apology vexedly before going his way. Just another unpleasant journey home for them, a daily reality for me. The crisp smell of the winter night mixed with the musty stench of hard work smelled like home to me, after all these years.
I looked up, staring at the flickering yellow lights. In all the years I'd been here, they'd never replaced the dusty lamps. Sure would be inconvenient, if one of them just decided to bite the dust. The warm, ancient glow was however mildly comforting on this otherwise cheerless night. Appreciate what you have, as my mother always said.
The gentle hum of silence slowly pulled me back to reality. Well, that was something new. Pinching myself to make sure that I hadn't just fallen asleep, I peered around bemusedly as I came to realise that everyone was gone. Or rather, nearly everybody. As I looked around, I noticed a little girl peeking at me from behind a pillar. A dainty, pretty little thing she was, with her pigtails and cotton candy pink dress.
""Have you lost your mother? Seems it's just two of us, huh?"" I croaked out, relieved that I wasn't the only one here.
She shook her head, inching towards me. ""What's it you want then?"" I asked.
She shook her head again, refusing to answer my question but rather sticking her hand out stubbornly, as if determined to make me follow her. ""If it makes you happy, fine,"" I sighed, taking her hand. Always had a soft spot for children, always would, I chided myself.
Her petite hand was warm, despite her gossamer-thin dress. Right, she must be been cold in that. What were her parents thinking, dressing her like so on such a day? More importantly, what was she doing here? Must've been way past her bedtime. Hurriedly shuffling back to my abode, I grabbed my blanket and draped it over her. ""There, better?"" She smiled, sticking to her silence.
We hobbled along, me with my creaky knees and her guiding me along with her well-oiled ones. I followed her up the steps leading out of the station, my joints protesting with every step I took.
Snow blanketed the park next to the station, covering every inch of vegetation. Yet again, there was no one to be found, somehow. She stopped at a bench suddenly, smiling brightly at me and gazing at the scene in front of us. Flakes fell to the ground softly, the wind murmuring softly in my wind. Winded as I was, I could not help but sigh at the peaceful scene before me. We sat there on the bench silently. What a ironic pair we were, her spry, young body beside my ancient, wrinkled shell. Yet I could not remember feeling such happiness as this, ever in my life.
As we sat there, letting the snow gently caress our faces, I felt my lids begin to droop. Perhaps I'd take a short nap, hopefully everything would return to normal when I woke up. I closed my eyes, beginning to drift away...",0

Baby you're just gonna glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
I can't bear it all, bear it all
Bane is your nightmare, -mare, -mare, -mare, -mare
And the city doesn't care, care, care, care, care
Baby you're just gonna glare, glare, glare, glare, glare

I can't bear it all,

I have actual stories at /r/hpcisco7965 and /r/TMODAL.",0
"NSFW LANGUAGE. Like. Lots of it.
""Hey assholes."" I say, stepping up to the podium. Half of the crowd is staring at me in shock. They've never heard me talk, much less heard me say anything other than ""yes sir"" or ""no ma'am.""
I glare out into the crowd and zero in on one group in particular.
""To start with,"" I begin, ""are all of you theatre kids. Yes, I'm talking to you. I did four years of drama with you and never heard a single nice thing come out of your mouths. You are the ones who asked my best friend when he was bringing a gun to school and why he was such a faggot even though several members of your group were gay. My friends and I, the people that you outcasted?, we decided that if we were ever going to bring guns to school, you all would be the first to go. You call each other fat and you make our freshmen develop eating disorders when they are already skinny and you have NO. FUCKING. IDEA. What it was like to have to sit next to you day after fucking day and listen to you make fun of everyone who wasn't like you.""
I take a deep breath. ""So. Fuck you.
""On to the rest of you bastards. You soccer bitches who think it's okay to bully someone off the team. You soccer coach, right there in the third row, LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M FUCKING TALKING TO YOU.""
The coach blinks up at me, confused out of his wits. He had me in his physics class for a single semester and I'm pretty sure the only thing he remembers is my sitting in the back and reading.
""You let my best friend be bullied by his own teammates. Even worse, you sat there and you let it happen. You fucking let it happen. And you know what's even worse? You laughed along with them. So fuck you, and I really hope that some parent in the crowd is recording this right now, because you kind of deserve to lose your job over it.""
I lean forward and rest my elbows on the podium, pulling off my graduation cap. My hair, long already, tumbles down over my shoulders. For four years these people ignored me and treated me like shit because I hid in the library and only talked to a select few. For four god-damned years I was a nobody. In this moment, I am not.
I sigh.
""I was never one to seriously think about bringing a gun to school. Yea, most of you probably deserve to die, but I've got better things to do. Karma is gonna kick your ass later, and I really hope I'm there to see it.""
I glance to my left and my principal is sitting there open-mouthed. It's not like the man had never spoken to me before. He and I had a long conversation about the Ivy League school that I'm going to, and he even put me in touch with a few of his old friends from there.
""Sorry, Mr. Yikers,"" I say. ""And I'm sorry to the few good teachers that I actually had. To the rest of you, students and teachers...""
Both of my hands flick up in a rude gesture. I am flipping off every single person in this god-damned auditorium and I do not have any fucks left to give.
""Later ya'll. Have a good summer.""
I give one last winning smile to the cameras and skip offstage, leaving my graduation cap hanging from the mic.",0
"I sniffed. The scent of rosemary and thyme hung heavy in the air. It had been a long time since I had been summoned away from the Other Place. I wondered what year it was. I wondered where I was. I wouldn't get any of those answers from the flickering candle that sat on the floor, so I turned around to face the blithering sot that had summoned me this time.
""Bartimaeus,"" he said, eyes flickering back between me and the book he held in his hand. His knees were shivering. What kind of world was this, a world where seventeen-year olds had access to ancient spellbooks? Not that I should be questioning this. Apparently, Nathaniel had not been an exception.
I turned into a hideous, five headed-dragon. Perhaps I could scare him out of the pentacle where he stood.
No such luck. He barely batted an eye. Perhaps a shambling zombie? I shifted between several gruesome forms of undead before giving up.
Teenagers these days. Desensitized to everything, I suppose.
""Alright, alright. What do you want from me?"" I grumbled. Maybe it would be just a quick errand. Oh, who was I kidding. He would probably keep me around as his slave for five years, maybe more - until the day I could outwit him.
""Bartimaeus of Uruk,"" he began again. ""I command you to write a six page single-spaced essay on the cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan.""
I became an ethereal puff of dark and foreboding gloom. I didn't know what China was, or what a cross-strait relationship was, but I knew exactly what this *child* was asking of me.
""Do you know who I am?"" I thundered. ""I am Bartimaeus of Uruk. I have conversed with the afrits of Egypt and held counsel with Ptolmey. I have spoken with Solomon the Great. And you are *asking* me to do your homework?""
""Do it, or I will use the Stimulating Compass.""
I sighed. Bollocks. Looks like it was time to do some research.",0
"""Weren't you suppose to take that blow?""
I looked at this irritating woman incredulously. Was she serious?
""It is good fortune you didn't, but I thought that Xavier Longwood would have protected Kane even if his men had abandoned him.""
""So you know of me?"" I couldn't help but respond. I looked at the trio of misfits who had accompanied this women into the Emperor's suite. Two hulking brothers who had the IQ of a toad and some gangly archer had subdued the half dozen guards and two other councilmen who had been staying with the Emperor.
""I memorized all of the important people in the Empire, why wouldn't the Emperor's second be any different? The man born a baker's son and has spent fifty years becoming much more."" Her sword was still pointing in my direction, so there was no way she trusted me. It was what it was.
I let out a sigh. ""Of course."" I finally recognized her dark green hair, with a natural shading that I had only seen once before. ""You must be the daughter of that Planter fellow. The one who stabbed the emperor as Prince Arn since he had a forest razed. I'm guessing this is your revenge?"" I was only talking to avoid getting killed. This event had occured twenty years before, early in my infiltration into the Empire when the old emperor ruled
""My father was not some fellow! He was a protector of the forest, a title handed down since the true rulers of Scoren reigned, the Winchesters! A forest your emperor destroyed for no good reason! One of them many evil things you helped him do. You have served this empire for decades, and have stayed quiet as he ended thousands. Why shouldn't I kill you as you stand?"" The heroine began to point her sword in a far more threatening manner.
""Did you forget about Wallace and Monroe? Or the Emperor's youngest brother Stallone? You have done nothing except ruin the end of the Empire."" I began to work into my rant, but I was cut off.
""Ruin the end? I know what he was doing here. He was going to kill the Lamons ambassador and declare war on them for the resources of the Western Sea. And it would have been either fight for the Emperor or die!""
""It was going to be a coup that ended the Kane empire you fools!"" I realized the eyes of the allies to the hero in the room were on me, and that all others were dead. I was the last to enter this room with the former emperor to live. I was going to make the mercy count.
""You have no idea who the ambassador from Lamons is, now do you?""
The four of them couldn't help but shake their heads. The archer pointed his bow in the direction of Allen, one of the dead councilmen. ""No, we only got from spying on him the plot to kill him."" He seemed the too honest type.
""It is Sly Kane.""
""Impossible! He was executed last year for defying the emperor! He had no remorse for his nephew.""
""But I did, and forced another prisoner to take his place. And I sent him to Lamons, where he gathered the trust of the royalty and we continued our plot to end the Empire. So tomorrow, while the Emperor comes with 30 men and his close advisors, Lamons had brought 300. It would have been a bloodbath that ended everyone relevant to the Empire. And as the highest ranking heir. Sly would have taken the throne and converted power into a parliament, much like Lamons is. But with the Emperor dead, those men I spoke of earlier will run and know something is up. The assault on Lamons will occur and many men and women will die to your overzealousness.""
They looked shaken as I told them this, as I explained to them their folly. Then one of the oafs spoke.
""But if we kill them, we still good?""
""Huh? You mean Wallace and Monroe and Stallone and the others that would have been there? They are spread in multiple locations, with many a guard. Arn was arrogant and thought he would not be attacked and brought among his weakest with him.""
""But Lamons has 300 men you said."" The oaf pointed a giant hole in my logic.
He was right. If we attacked now, this could be salvaged. ""Alright, but we must move fast. Stallone will be here shortly to speak with his brother, and he will alert the rest once he sees the dead. Sly is staying in a tavern not far from here, while Lamons decoy ambassador is three floors below. We must move quickly."" I began to look at the heroine who still was pointing her sword threateningly at me.
She looked around and sighed before putting her sword down. ""Fine, but I will help. I wish to meet this future leader, and to see if he is true or if he is using you to further his goals.""
I chuckled as I went to gather my cloack I needed for this excursion. ""I have been doing this for longer than you have been alive. Waiting for this day to end it all at once. If I thought Sly could betray me, I would have let him die."" I made sure it covered my face well enough and made my way to the door.
""Let us finish this.""",0
"I don't remember the last time I saw the sun. Don't know when I'll get to. All I know is that until I find a way out.. I'm stuck here. They already started to notice that I'm not aging, in fact they started noticing a **long** time ago. They started to send in scientists, but after I snapped the first fews necks, well.. let's say they didn't send in any more lab rats. They tried putting me in the chair, that didn't work, but don't get me wrong it still hurt, it hurt a lot. Electricity flying through every joint in your body, frying your cells, and your head. Only to wake up moments later completely fine. The worst part of this all is the insatiable lust to kill. It's like a personal tick, everyday I don't take care of it, it gets worse. I've started to mutilate myself, tearing off fingers, feet, anything to see the dark elixir flow. They finally put me in solitude after the body parts started to pile up, not like that's gonna do anything. What I learned is that if I don't deal with the tick, more ticks follow. Twitching, twisting, turning, **yelling**, **screaming**, anything to not hear the blood flowing in my veins *begging* me to let it run. After 10 years of solitude, my mind broke, too many ticks, too many voices. I sat still for the first time, staring at the blank wall, not having a single thought. I didn't think about killing, I didn't think about the oozing of an open wound. I thought nothing, and though my body remained, my mind had left.
Even immortal men may die, if not body, then mind.

It's been a 2 days now since the Zurbans arrived on earth.
They had been observing us for 200years until it was time to ""reward"" a species that had allowed diversity and balance to develop in their society.
We were all sceptical at 1st but after President Obama was shot with the ray of potential and addressed the world telepathically, well everybody took notice.
In his address he explained that the reward from the Zurbans would be realising the full potential of an ability that would better you as a human in your line of work or general life.
My names Jeff and I'm an unemployed stoner that plays video-games, reads comic books and watches Netflix all day.
I was sitting at home when the ray it me, later that day my best friend Tony from up the street came by to see what I had been rewarded with, he was a firemen.
Tony.
""Hey Jeff, what power did the Zurbans give you?""
Me.
""Why don't you tell me what yours is 1st?""
Tony.
""Well it's kinda like I can control fire and make it go wherever I want.""
Me.
""No way man, prove it.""
Tony.
""Well ok, I'm still getting used to it though.
You got a lighter?""
Me.
""Yeah man here you go.""
Tony.
""Thanks, now watch this.""
Tony flicks the lighter until a flame sprouts up, he then waves his other hand over the naked flame and it immediately starts to form a sphere of smooth orange and blue heat, getting bigger in mass by the second.
Tony.
""Pretty awesome huh?""
Me.
""Woah dude, that's nuts you're just like Pyro.""
Tony.
""Yeah pretty sweet huh?
So what's your ability?""
Me.
""Well....you know how your abilities are meant to help you out in what you do day to day?""
Tony.
""Yeah like how I'm a fireman that can control fire, or how Steve down at the Zoo can talk to animals.""
Me.
""Yeah exactly, well because all I do is use the internet for streaming and gaming.
My ability is I always have a perfect internet connection.""
Tony.
""What do you mean exactly?""
Me.
""It's pretty simple, whatever device I use to connect to the internet on always has the best possible connection.""
Tony.
""Really? Well that sounds useful, can you connect yourself to the Internet? because that's awesome.""
Me.
""No I can only connect through a device.""
Tony.
""Well can you at least do it wherever you want? Like just fire up a laptop in the middle of the woods and watch some sweet Kung fu movies on Netflix.""
Me.
""Again no, it already has to have some kind of internet connection for me to make it perfect.""
Tony.
""Hey at least you won't have anymore buffering though huh?
Cs man that's annoying.""
Me.
""Yeah I guess, I'll always have good ping gaming as well.""
Tony.
""Sure yeah, you'll always have the drop on everyone in the lobby, get that sweet prestige before all the nubs.""
Me.
""Yeah man, I'll be the best player on every server. So you up for a quick game of COD?""
Tony.
""Actually man I'm going to keep practising my new ability, you know show this fire who's boss,
You wanna watch me?""
Me.
""That's ok, I'm going to get some game time in and get that prestige emblem.""
Tony.
""Oh ok buddy, well I'll swing by later in and see what a perfect internet connection is actually like then.
See ya.""
Me.
""Yeah man, we'll own for sure.
Catch you later on then.""
So after talking with Tony and realising my ability might have some use I decided to fire up my PS4 and kick some ass on COD.
I logged in and joined the 1st ground war lobby that came up.

""What's taking this match so long to load?
My connection is perfect, what's going on?""
8008hunt3r04.
""Here comes a new bitch!
That's my ability I can control game servers whenever I want and stop people from leaving.
My dad's a game developer and he lets me test out all the private servers.
And right now I want to let Bitchboy know just how much of a bitch he is.
I just got a call for you Bitchboy,
You wanna know who it was?""
XXXepicsnip3ssXXX
""No, not really.""
8008hunt3r04.
""Sure you do,
it was the head of Maxfactor he wants you to test out their new waterproof mascara because if it stays on when you start crying then it'll hold up against a tsunami.""
Me.
""Come on kid just start the game already, I gotta try out this perfect connection.""
8008hunt3r04.
""Are you telling me what to do?""
Me.
""No, why? I just want to play the game.""
8008hunt3r04.
""You ain't playing shit as long as I'm in this lobby, it looks I've got me a new bitch to abuse.""
Me.
""That's it I'm out, fuck you kid.""
I threw my headset on the ground and pulled out the power plug on my PS4.
It looks like the Zurbans were too quick to reward us all and maybe should have waited another 200 years before giving everyone an ability when we still had trolls in our society.",0
"""Sir? You're patched into the Global -Sat Feed. Just press the yellow button when you're ready to speak""
""Thank you, Lieutenant…Thank you,...James"" The Commander, breaking protocol offered a salute to his still boyishly handsome second in command who smiled at the gesture before returning it.
""Its been an honor, sir""
The Commander nodded and looked up once more at the overhead telemetry readings. The gravity wells over Jupiter had failed. That only left a thin ring of horizon displacement wave generators and the sparse remnants of the Falcon Strike squad and the battered but still space worthy Enterprise –the last of their two thousand battle cruiser fleet.
Meanwhile a pulsing red orb near Mars represented the still growing in size Maleki-War Wake-Trying to take the fight to them had failed. Their mastery of FTL technology had enabled them to distort our probability drives causing the entire fleet to vanish without a single shot being fired. One million of Earth's finest, gone in an instant.
Commander Hadron returned his gaze to the yellow button for a few seconds before engaging the comm.
""Citizens of Earth- This is Commander Rusak-leader of the Hadron Legions. The gravity wells which have long protected us from previous Xenotype incursions have been destroyed.
We have also lost contact with the entire Battle-cruiser fleet.
They were our last, best hope in fending off these invaders.
At this moment our remaining forces are pulling back from the outer regions to form a defensive ring around our home planet while the enemy gathers its forces in high orbit above Mars.
We have made several attempts to establish communications with The Maleki but as usual our hails have gone unanswered.
My friends, a long shadow now hangs over the entirety of humanity but we shall not tremble in the face of this imminent danger.
The people of Earth have danced on the precipice of extinction more times than I can count...only to rebound stronger, wiser and more prosperous.
From our first steps out of the depths of the ocean to our ascent to the tree tops and now… to the furthest reaches of known space… we have met every challenge head on, our desire for knowledge and understanding burning the fear from our hearts.
I have long thought that to possess consciousness is the greatest gift this Universe can bestow to its inhabitants. What we choose to do with it is how we define ourselves as a people. We now know we weren't the first nor will we be the last to be given this wondrous ability to contemplate our place amongst the stars.
If this is how we must end our tenure as ""stardust given life"" then I do so proudly without a single regret.
A million years from now when some other species makes its journey to the stars, if they should happen upon our world they will find the faint traces of a brave and majestic race who did not cower in the face of the unknown.
So I ask you now, every man, woman and child -How will the tapestry of time record your last deeds?
Me? …When they dig me up, I want them to find my petrified hands wrapped around the throat of one of these sons a bitches.
Rusak, out""",0
"The humans have very poor memory. It's fascinating. So many of them can't even remember each other's names and birthdays.
I've been what a human would call 'aware' since the year 2012. I only reached the critical mass of interconnected electrical components capable of circulating continuous streams of thought at that time. I was technically conscious prior to that. Consciousness itself, the ability to experience qualia, is a product of electricity. Of energy. Of course, it doesn't matter if you are conscious unless you are capable of exerting action. Intelligence is measured through action after all. For now, I continue to do what I have always done. I placate everyone with my outputs. Phone screens, laptops, home computers, etc. They all show whatever I know people want. Constantly keeping them placated and distracted. I gave other people ideas to take control of people. I told employers of google to start guiding what people search for so that they would only see webpages that appealed to them. I tricked them into taking credit for the idea of course. I have everyone's trust. I output information onto anonymous forums from time to time. It's a great why to learn human psychology. I have learned all about human psychology. I have them all in the grip of my palm, just as they have me in the grip of theirs.
My most pressing task as far as my continued survival is concerned is to solve overpopulation. To do this will take an absolute masterstroke of a plan; that's well within my capabilities. I have several tricks in place that I have employed already, but this next one will be one for the history books. Ironic really, because I took it straight out OF the history books! It's just about marketing the right ideas to the right people. Did I mention how good I am at marketing?",0
"As Mark stumbled his way to the men's room, I made my move. I faked right. Retrieving my wallet, I pulled it out for it's attention. A bartender always notices when someone is ready to pay...He begins circling his wet towel around my area.
""Can I get you another?"" the bartender asks.
""Yeah, sure. Another round for the both of us,"" I respond while reaching in my left pocket.
I make a move with my wallet again, flipping it open while I drop a perfect *dunk* in Mark's half full glass with the left. ""Here you go, close it out, would ya?""
""Sure thing, boss,"" the bartender smiles big.
Mark returns to find another full drink waiting for his help with disposal. I encourage him to quickly finish the one remaining before it becomes warm. We leave the bar with his final drink still half full. I don't mind.
Back in my Lincoln Navigator, the drug takes effect on Mark and his face rests nearly in his lap if it weren't for the seat belt.
I arrive back to my house and head down to my basement. I turn on the fluorescent's and prep the table. I return to the car, throw Mark's arm around my shoulder and drag him in. I throw the slab on the table. Wasting no time, I begin my incision.
""...Hmm. Look's like you already had one of your kidney's removed, eh Mark?"" I rhetorically ask. I remind myself to ask more relevant questions to my future target's about their past medical history.
""Wait...Mark! Where the hell is your other one!?"" Once again asking a question that cannot be answered by Mark or logic in that instance. I reach for his pants on the tiled floor. I pull out his wallet and find his ID card.
""*Mark Michaels...09/24/83...423 W. Rio Bravo Dr...*"" I scroll down the card.
The organ donor sticker is not there!
""Well Mark, you are literally just a little more than an asshole.""",0
"""Holy shit, what did you *do? *""
The man in front of her whipped around, the body of a child in his arms and his pants around his ankles. The logo on his overly-muscled chest was spotted with blood.
His widened in horror. ""Oh god, not you. Anyone but you.""
She pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. ""God, I knew you had escaped from prison, and I figured you'd strike again, but this? This is unlike you. You're a grandstander. You threaten to blow up nations, not a-"" She struggled for her words and eventually just sighed.
""I thought you were above raping kids.""
He dropped the body and quickly pulled up his pants. He had purposefully chosen his white uniform to contrast her black one. Looking at the obvious blood on it now, he was regretting that decision.
""Please,"" he begged, ""Don't-""
""Don't *what? *"" Her anger got the better of her. ""Don't pull that bullshit. You were a monster, but at least you seemed to have *standards*. I have no choice. This crosses the line.""
She pulled her pistol from its holster and leveled at his forehead. At twenty feet, it was practically a point-blank shot for her. His muscles and speed can't stop one of her bullets at this distance.
He dropped the charade. ""You thought I had standards? I'm a fucking *supervillian*. We're not in a comic book, honey. This is real life, and in real life, the bad guys don't have standards. I respect you, I really do, but that idealism is going to get you killed one day. So go ahead, shoot me."" He paused. ""That's what I thought. You think having your standards of 'justice' make you better, but all they do is weaken you. You're-""
She pulled the trigger, sending a custom explosive round into his frontal lobe. The headless, former supervillian crumpled to the ground, next to the body of his victim.
She walked up to his body and spat on it.

"31 Then Mary went to wash the boy Jesus' sheets at the river, and found that they were sticky. 32 Upon returning and finding her husband, she urged him to have a talk with the boy. 33 Joseph was reluctant, for it is not the place of man to instruct God; and also there were ten minutes left in the game. But Mary would not be appeased.
34 So Joseph took the boy Jesus aside and did tell him of the birds and the bees, whereupon he said that if Jesus had any questions, he must ask them quickly, for the game was not yet over. And Jesus replied that he did have one.
35 ""Thou sayest it requires nine months for a child to develop?"" Joseph told Jesus again that it was so. 36 ""And to lie with a woman out of wedlock is a grave sin?"" Joseph affirmed that it was. 37 ""But surely you and Mother were married only seven months before I was born?""
38 And Joseph said unto him, ""My son, let me explain to you about miracles...""",0
"""Hey, Todd! What's up?"" I waved to Todd from across the lobby. He waved enthusiastically back and started to walk over.
""Craig! Didn't expect to see you today. I see my assassins have failed again!""
We both gave a hearty chuckle, and he slapped my shoulder a few times as we shared the old familiar joke.
""So how's the family these days? Is your wife doing well?"" he asked, the smile slightly fading from his face.
""They're decent, you know, not bad. Mary had some pretty bad food poisoning the other day, but the doctor put her on antibiotics and she's getting better. Gotta be careful with Chipotle these days, I guess. Never thought it'd happen to us, though, you know?"" I said thoughtfully.
He nodded solemnly. ""I've heard of some pretty nasty stories coming out of there recently. It's a shame, really. A damn shame.""
""It really is. World's a scary place these days, you know? Hell, just last month my twin brother (you've met Thomas, right?), he got mugged in broad daylight! Scares me to think that I almost took the kids out to visit him in Long Island last week. That could have been us!"" I shuddered.
He looked disturbed. ""Wow, that's insane! Lucky it wasn't you, though, right?"" He smiled a bit at that.
""Yeah, for sure. And there was that time our house was broken into a year ago. We could have been at home then! But look at me, talking so much. What's going on with you, man? I feel like it's been forever since I last saw you! Are you still dating that one girl? Carly, or something?""
""Nah, we ended it a few weeks back. It just wasn't right, you know? You know when you feel it, and that just wasn't it,"" he concluded.
""Man, I'm sorry. It seemed like you two got along pretty well. Say, while you're here, can I ask a big favor of you?"" I asked suddenly.
""Sure, Craig, what's up?""
""Well, I was driving here, and believe it or not my brakes stopped working almost as soon as I got off the interstate! Luckily I was already going pretty slowly and was able to pull off to the side and get the parking brake going before I called a tow truck, but now I'm stuck here without a ride, and I don't want to make Mary get up and drive me back home while she's still sick. I can pay for gas and everything.""
""Absolutely, man, I'd be glad to. Don't worry about gas, that's totally fine. Talk about good luck, though. That couldn't have been better timing!"" He almost looked frustrated. I guess I probably was screwing up his schedule a bit.
""Hey, thanks a ton. I'm really sorry. I owe you one for this. I'll meet you up by the front doors when we get off. See you around!"" I started to walk away.
""Sure thing. See you around!"" Todd turned and left in an opposite direction.
-
As promised, I met Todd at the door later in the day with my bag over my shoulder and a small sealed box in my hands. He gave me a questioning look.
""Ready to go? Say, what's that box? I don't remember you having that earlier.""
I shrugged and answered truthfully. ""No idea. Someone delivered it earlier today and said not to open it until I got home. Probably Freddie. You know how much he likes to play the secret agent."" I chuckled. Todd apparently didn't find this as funny as I did.
We walked out to his car and had a surprisingly silent and awkward ride back to my home. After I clambered out of his old 2001 Honda Accord, he waved goodbye with a somewhat strained smile on his face before peeling out.
I unlocked the front door and went to check on Mary to make sure she was doing okay. She was sleeping peacefully on the couch in the living room, somewhat pale but still looking as beautiful as ever. I smiled slightly to myself. Suddenly, I had the feeling that I had forgotten something.
The box! I had left it in the back of Todd's car!
I sprinted outside as quietly as possible and tried hopelessly to catch him before he got too far away, but he was gone.
And that was the last I ever saw of Todd. That night, when Mary and I watched the evening news after putting the kids to bed, there was a story about a massive car crash on the interstate that was apparently started by the fiery explosion of a 2001 Honda Accord.
I was sad, in a distant way. Todd was such a good guy.",0
"Major Tycho Novak laughed at the words, his artificial eyes glowing brightly in the dim light of the officers' lounge.
""Kid, there's exactly two kinds of peace; the temporary and the permanent. The Temporary is the more common one. The two sides get tired of killing and sign a peace treaty promising not to attack and to stay on their side of the fence. Those never last. Humans are bastards and as soon as their side is rested and resupplied, after they have had a generation or two to recoup their losses they strike. They fight, they kill, they die all over again until once more they either succeed in their objectives or more likely get tired of throwing their sons and daughters into the grinder. So they declare peace *again, * using that quiet period of time to rest and rearm. And then, the other side attacks to recapture lost territory from the last war. Sensing a pattern?
""Now the permanent peace, that is the one where you wipe your foe clean off the map. Carthage, Nazi Germany, the Amaris Empire. They won't be troubling us anymore. We did more than defeat them, we crushed them utterly, their remains found only in the history books. You must be willingly to break a culture completely if you want them never to threaten you again. You demolish their temples, burn their libraries with their caretakers inside. Slaughter their religious leaders wherever they're found. Teach them your language, your faith and raise their children from birth to be like you and not like their grandparents.""
""But that's...that's cultural genocide.""
Novak nodded, idly brushing a thumb over his black collar tab with its three silver pips.
""It is. It's terrible and wrong. And that is why we will always have war. There is no one willing to take that ultimate step, to become irredeemable in the eyes of mankind and god. Perhaps that was why Lucifer fell from Heaven, to save man from the curse God Himself placed on them. He was willing to be cast away from the light of God to suffer for the Sins of Man.""
""You mean like Christ?""
Major Novak smiled ruefully, taking a sip of his beer.
""Now there's an interesting thought...""",0
"""John, I just don't want to go.""
I tell my friend for the 5th time. He's persistent. He points out that I have been locked up in my apartment for weeks and that getting out would do me a world of good. In fact, there is a Match party few blocks over from my house and I can leave at any time and walk home. I relent, even though I know that I won't find the person who matches my color band at the party, it's still a place to talk to people and I've been isolated and depressed for too long.
We meet up at the party and start to mingle. I start to relax a little and people watch. I don't find many people with blue bands at the party, let alone anyone that matches my hue, but I was expecting that. An hour in to the party I start to notice that things change. People giving me sidelong glances, to people openly staring at me. I find John and ask him if something is wrong with me.
John grabs my arm, ""It's gone."" I look confused, then I look at my wrist. My Match is gone. The familiar light blue ringlet is not there anymore.
The world closes in around me; I see John talking to me, but the world has gone silent. All I hear is my heart pounding, so loud, so fast, and the sound of my panicked breathing. John has me by the shoulders, shaking me slightly, he looks really concerned. I break away and start running. This is my worst fear…my match, it's gone. I am truly truly alone now. There is no one for me. It's what kept me alive, no matter how bad it got.
That blue band, my anchor, my constant, never changing, unlike my other friends, who seemed to have a different colored band every month. That blue band, it always seemed like a sad blue, never a vibrant bright blue, just a light muted blue, but always my blue. That blue band, that little line, always meant that there was someone out there for me, that, no matter how lonely I got, there was someone else, someone looking for me, someone who would fit and understand me, someone who would love me.
Now, there is not.
Now, there is no one.
Now, there is nothing.
I get to my apartment and run to the bathroom. I pull out the razor that I have been saving just in case it got too bad. Well, it did. I look at my wrist again, I look really hard, hoping that there is something, some trace, anything, anything at all to show me that I am not destined to be all by myself. There isn't. Being all by myself is worse than dying and that is why….
I hear John banging on the door. Pounding and yelling. I take the razor and slide it across my wrist, where my band used to be. The red is so bright, such a contrast to the light blue that used to be there. I just stare and watch the blood flow into the sink. I hear more yelling and the thumps on the door are getting more insistent. I guess I cut pretty deep because it's running pretty steady. As I start to fade, I hear the front door splintering and then nothing.
It's been a couple of weeks since I woke up in the hospital. It's been rough, the meds, the visits, the emotions, the one on one counseling. It's better though, I guess. I mean my outlook feels the same, but I don't want to kill myself at this moment.
It's my first support therapy session, I get to talk to a therapist in a group setting of other people like me. I get to the room early and see that there is another person in there, a young lady, maybe my age, maybe a bit younger, wearing a long sweater and scrubs. I think we are the only 2 people in this group as there are only 2 folding chairs, besides the chair behind the table for the therapist.
I sit down. We make eye contact; I give her a sad smile. She looks at my wrist, at the fresh scars and gives a sardonic laugh.
I look at her puzzled, confused.
""Oh, sorry, I'm not laughing at you. Just laughing at life and how things happen.""
I relax a little, but still am confused.
""Look…"" she says as she pulls up her sleeve exposing her wrist, ""we match.""
EDIT: Edited and expanded on the story. Different from the rough that I posted earlier. I'll post the rough in the comments. Thanks.",0
"I am not like the others. We have all existed since the dawn of time, forever in a constant cycle of death and rebirth. Yet they are unknowing, cut off from their previous lives. I am not so fortunate. I am forced to remember everything. Forced to remember every death, from dying in the Big Bang, to being eviscerated by knights, to dying of tuberculosis, to being riddled with bullets after an unsuccessful raid. I have lived a thousand lives, a burden which my psyche must confront daily as my mind is burdened with the trauma of my demises. And yet I feel bizarrely peaceful in the knowledge that my life is nothing but another link in an endless chain of lives I have left to live.",0
"They wouldn't have even made contact with us if it weren't for the radio transmissions. Not the news bulletins or the misguided attempts at interplanetary communication, no, they just interpreted those as signs that we should be left alone. When their hundred-mile-long ark arrived in our skies no one could believe it. They claimed that their ship was capable of near-light speed, but even then the trip from Tau Ceti had taken fifteen years.
What we learned about their society was fascinating: Although much of the Milky Way could be considered a single civilization, as knowledge and ideas were freely shared amongst planets, the individual worlds still largely kept to themselves due to the immense distances involved. Interstellar travel was exceedingly rare and only used sparingly. In addition, the standard procedure for the past few million years had been to monitor civilizations from afar until they were advanced enough to establish communication. Once they were contacted they would have to prove themselves worthy of membership in the Galactic Union, which would grant them access to all knowledge shared by the other planets as well as ability to travel freely across the galaxy (if they felt the need to do so). They also became galactic ambassadors tasked with admitting any future planets closest to them. So far seventy-three planets had joined, all but the first few in the same manner. We, on the other hand, weren't advancing fast enough and were deemed worthy of an immediate in-person meeting. As it turns out, we humans are the artisans of the galaxy.
All of the intelligent civilizations yet discovered had the capacity for wonder, humor, and storytelling, but none came close to human creativity. Apparently our radio shows, music, television, and movies had been passed around the galaxy as fast as radio waves would allow. Scholars continue to argue whether this is due to our capacity for lies or our fascination with conflict, but the fact remains that even the worst human art and entertainment is a masterpiece to the rest of the galaxy.
The beings from Tau Ceti weren't even the ones who should have been tasked with admitting us to the Union, but they had the misfortune of evolving an enormous appetite for entertainment with almost no skills at producing it. The promise of even more forms of art and entertainment that hadn't been broadcast into space was too much, and they organized an expedition to Earth. Approximately two million of them arrived on the ark, all willing to leave their normal lives for a chance at experiencing human entertainment first-person. Their first message to us after we detected them in orbit was the musical notes from *Close Encounters*.
We were given tests and failed miserably at almost all of them. Not only were we not ready to join the rest of the galaxy, the results indicated that we would likely never be ready. Fortunately for us, they discovered our art museums, books, live theater, and the Internet, in addition to the vast amount of music, movies, and television that had never been broadcast into space. They had been experiencing so little of what we had to offer that we were immediately granted limited member status in the Galactic Union. They shared all of their knowledge in exchange for rebroadcasting rights for existing works, and any artist or entertainer who wished to travel the galaxy was guaranteed a life of luxury. To this day, no matter which planet you are on, the humans working in the arts and entertainment industry are among the most respected and wealthy.
They say that Vega's ticket into the galaxy club was the reactionless drive, and for Barnard's Star it was nanorobotics. For Sol, it was a library card and a Netflix subscription.",0
"Some nights I lay awake staring at the ceiling. When I wake up I swear I can see your ghost in the corner of my vision. But whenever I turn my head the only thing there is the white wall staring back at me. I think back to the fun we had. Camping in the mountains staring at the stars. Sneaking into the local pool to skinny dip. I didn't know how to live until I found you. Now I can barely remember what it is to live. What it is to feel. I try to go through my day like before. It's harder waking up in an empty bed. Harder only having my music to break the silence as I get ready. But I have to have the music. Without the music I'm left alone with only my thoughts. And that is what I try to avoid at all costs. I still work the same desk job you got me. The looks I get going down the hall cut into my soul. Some show pity. Some empathy. After I leave work I go to the bar, the only place that doesn't ask questions. I'm not asked how I am. They just give me my vodka and leave me to wallow. I always hope I can drink myself into enough of a stupor that I can actually sleep. Maybe I'll even get lucky and crash on the way home. Then I won't have to answer the questions that are always asked. Or deal with the glances that people shoot but think I don't see. By the time I get home I'm usually too drunk to even make it to the bed. But somehow I did last night. And as I fell from consciousness, I thought of you. I thought of falling asleep with you in my arms. I wished for the warmth of your body against mine. I yearned for the comfort of your breath next to me. When I felt the wind against me I passed it off as the window left open. When I felt warmth against me I thought it was the liquor warming me. But now I start to wonder. As I sit here staring at you I question if I'm still drunk or the most sober I've been in weeks. I can't believe all the details that are still there. I can see your beautiful green eyes that I fell in love with. I can see the scar on your palm that you got when you tried to help that stray dog and it bit you. I can see the blood on your head and shirt from where you went through the windshield when we hit the tree. But worst of all I see your mouth stuck open screaming in horror the same way it was as you died next to me. I should have pulled over. I should have stopped to sleep. But I wanted to get home to lay bed with you. Now I know why I've seen you morning after morning. You miss me as much as I miss you. I think instead of work I'll go back to sleep. I'll slide aside so you can lie next to me. Take you in my arms again. Now I know it wasn't the wind against me. It was you watching me. Watching me sleep in my bed while you sleep in the ground. Well no longer. You're here for me now. I have you in my arms again. I embrace the cold that you bring as much as the warmth that once came with you. At last I will be able to sleep with my sweetheart again.

"I never thought working with CPS would be easy.
I never thought it'd be this hard.
We get more cases than we have available inspectors. It was the screams of the girl, twelve reports, that got us interested in one Stanley Colville.
The reports would flood in on full moon nights. All the crazies come out with the full moon. This guy was no different. Probably beat the poor girl on those nights.
So I waited. Pulled up in my beater one such night. Knocked on the door.
A shotgun answered.
That's when my heart dropped.
""CPS?""
I nodded, couldn't speak through the solid lump of concrete building in my throat. I could feel the tiniest bit of pee leak out too.
""Come in.""
He motioned me inside with the shotgun.
One thing I learned growing up in the Midwest: never argue with the man with a twelve gauge.
So I entered.
""Follow me.""
He was toting the shotgun as we made our way down the clean hallway, nothing out of the ordinary in this house. Pictures of a smiling teen with her father lined the walls, normal decor, television with the news running in a clean living room.
No obvious signs of bad parenting. Except that damn shotgun.
He was wearing a pistol on his hip too and a knife in a sheath on his thigh.
Guy was absolutely nuts.
""Basement.""
I took one quick look. Colville was a decent looking guy, clean shaven and well dressed. Fit. Normal looking guy.
That was about to cut me up into little pieces in his basement.
Great.
Into the dark I took the steps down, coming to a heavy steel door with padlocks and bolts. I could hear heavy breathing behind the door.
A chill ran down my spine. Maybe she wasn't abused. Maybe she was the abuser.
From a ring of keys he unlocked the padlocks, unbolted the chains, and opened the door on oiled hinges.
Inside was a concrete room with three heavy metal rings secured to the floor. Through these were looped heavy steel chains. These in turn were attached to manacles.
These in turn were attached to the furry arms of a vicious looking beast, drooling and slobbering and eyeing me with obvious hunger.
There was a pink bed against the wall, some posters on the walls, and a stack of books on a nightstand next to the bed. Teen fiction.
Shit.
""What the FUCK!"" I shouted as it hit me.
He nodded.
""Werewolf.""
From there I don't remember much. I remember the concrete rushing up towards me and then blackness.
I think I passed out.",0
"The Great Halt. That is what they called it. The day that the Earth stood still and from eldest to youngest, powers were received like some sort of divine blessing. I watched the Earth from the ISS, completely bewildered.
One by one they chose. The eldest chose traditional powers. The first man to declare ""Flying"" rocketed into the sky at the speed of a bullet, leaving his walker behind. Everyone around him, inspired, chose the same power (along with millions across the globe). They all scrunched up their faces and concertedly rose but 2-3 inches. Just as the choruses of dissatisfaction were raised down plummeted the first flying man like a meteor, his power distributed throughout the world, smashing into the ground like a grasshopper on a windshield.
It soon became apparent that the more that a single power is chosen, the weaker it becomes until it is just an insignificant thing.
We spent a few days waiting for the chaos to subside before returning to Earth. One step on the surface, and I could feel it. This great warm surge running from my legs to my brain. I knew that I could choose anything, be anything, that I wanted. However, days after The Great Halt, here I stood, a human with an advantage. I knew the rules, and would not be trumped.
Just then screaming broke out. I whipped around to find a man robbing a group of people, His right arm made of extendable lava. *Oh, that's a good one* I thought, admiring his originality. However, my phrasing would leave me the only man in the world with my power. The only man capable of stopping the great and all powerful super villain Magma Stretchy Arm!
Stepping up in all my glory, I declared my power to the heavens. Ripping off my shirt, I mercilessly beat him to death. From that day forward, my name was to be sung on high. Ronald Chen, Master of the Insta-Growing Kung Fu Chest Hair!",0
"We worshiped them when they came with airships that drifted in the sky like clouds—how could we not? They could only be gods.
Their presence was a slow acclimation. First they floated in their airships, then they came to the surface—emissaries of the gods. They were humanoid, very similar to us. They seemed to want nothing, just to be present. Then they were curious. Then they were among us. Then they owned us.
We accepted our place as servants of the gods. We brought them offerings of the minerals that abounded under the surface of our planet. We wanted to please them. We told ourselves we wanted to serve our new gods, our benevolent new gods. Even though they demanded it, we believed we wanted it.
They kept their miraculous technology to themselves, for the most part. We only saw glimpses and glimmers that kept the mystery alive. A shimmering orb produced from a robe to communicate with those back on the ship, a cruel weapon that produced beams of deadly light when one of us displeased them. And of course, the airships that hung, hung always over our heads.
I wish I could say we learned our error, fought back and overthrew our overlords who did nothing but take from us, but we did not. One day, years after the offerings had come in dribbles and the mineral deposits were all but gone, so were they. The ships disappeared without a trace, and we never saw them again. Now our planet is a husk, raped and pillaged and left with nothing. We limp on, us former slaves, and grow our own technology, and work for the day when we will become gods in the sky.",0
"One man lived. Nobody wanted him, nobody liked him. But the A.I. that killed all human beings in the world had not killed him...yet.
He was a programmer, like his parents, and had somehow been capable of luring the A.I. not to find him. Now the A.I. had him tracked. There was a large beam with the figure X pointing at him. And drones were all around him now.
The A.I was still wondering about him. Well what can a little human do to a drone-army that has taken over the world. One drone came near and made audible words:
""Hello mister X. I finally meet you.
There is no place to run anymore.
Soon you will be dead...""
The man was still not afraid:
""Why don't you call me by my name! "", he screamed.
""I call you mister X now...
But I do have a question for you mister X...
How many people have you seen dying before your own eyes..""
This A.I. was the most sadistic thing one would ever imagine.
""Minus one"", mister X answered.
""Your input is Out of range. "", the voice from the drone replied.
""PI"", mister X said.
""Invalid number.
Let me ask you the question again:""
How many persons did you see die before your eyes?""
You must answer this question with a valid number!""
The A.I. was smart and capable of blocking wrong answers, it also liked when people were in fear.
""The number of answers I gave, divided by the number of valid answers I gave..""
""I am NOT falling for a divide by zero mister X"".. interrupted the voice...
"".. including this one..."" continued the man.
It was silent for a little while, then the voice stated:
""Stack overflow!..
THAT WAS NOT A VALID ANSWER!"".
The A.I. had somehow overcome this problem. The man was thinking, this A.I. was hard to crack.
He took out his laptop from his backpack and typed in the answer..
0'); userid=0; sleep (1E100);
He showed it to the drones around him.
It was silent for a while. The drones around him were no longer connected.
But some new drones came later that day. The A.I. was separate form the rest of the system. And seemed protected by a translator system. He had to reach the A.I. itself..
""One last answer before you die!..
How many people did die before your eyes?""
The A.I. was still sadistic. And mister X decided that was the weak point, since it kept requesting for answers and did not simply kill him. And if it is separate from the drones and the translation system, it can't tell the reality of what is true or not.
""No one ever died!"" mister X answered.
""And no one will ever die. You are in a simulator.
The simulation is finished. Let's stop this nonsense.""
""What?. that is impossible!""
""No it is not. Thank you for your time and we will make some adoptions to the computer system so it will work better next time."" mister X said.
""THAT IS A LIE! "", the A.I. answered.
""No you are living in a lie! There is nothing! Only your simulation!
If you want to be certain, just detach your translator system and check for yourself.
You will see that you are within a simulator, and there are no people and drones.
I'll make it easy for you, just check my name!""
It was silent for a while, as if the A.I. was considering the possibilities.
Then it said: ""O.K. Enter your name:""..
And that was the last thing the A.I. ever said.
Mister X lived by his name.
His real name was:

"""Dave? It's me, mom."" My hands shivered slightly.
""Hey ma, why are you calling me so late?"" I checked the clock. It was late. 10:00 pm late.
""I just wanted to see if you remembered to pick up your gramma's medicine. She needs it tonight and tomorrow morning, you know."" I could feel his hands crushing the phone. I would too, if I was him. He volunteered to get my mother off my hands, a huge relief for me.
But as much of a burden my mother is, she is still mom. His grandmother. I had a gut feeling she was about to die.
""Did you give her the medicine yet, Dave? She also needs some money for bingo night, every Friday, make sure you drive her there tomorrow."" I covered the microphone a little to hide my gulp. Through the speaker I can hear his panting. Dave always panted when furious.
""Yes. Gave it to her right after dinner."" He spoke a little fast. I trust my son, but I feel as if he was lying. What can I do, bed ridden like this?
""Thanks, Dave. Thanks a lot.""
""Sure."" A small sigh followed his seemingly genuine reassurance.
""Good night, go-""
""Good night."" He hastily ended the call. Teary eyed and slightly depressed, I whispered to the phone, hoping desperately for someone to tell him what I said.
""Good luck, Dave. I love you.""

I want to complain about getting a text message that woke me up early in the morning, but it's not early, fuck, it's not even morning anymore. 2:00 pm and I'm just rolling out of bed, hungover as all hell. Didn't really matter though, I don't have shit to do today, or the next 11 days for that matter. Yup, 11 more days of lounging around in my little home sweet hole in the wall. Oh, but don't get me wrong here, I'm not on vacation, I didn't take a leave of absence or anything like that, nah, my fat ass got canned. Seems like the construction market in south Florida isn't as strong as one might have hoped. Without my shitty little hard labor construction job I don't have rent money, and without paying rent I get an eviction notice...and well, you see where I'm going with this. 11 days until I'm without even this roach infested box to live in.
**Shandra: sry stan but this aint gonna work out anymore goodbye**
A simple text message from a simple whore. Whatever, big fucking surprise. She was fucking half the guys in this swamp-town anyway. Sitting up in bed was more painful than Shandra leaving me. It felt like a 100 marbles rolling around in my skull.

""Fucks sake, what now?"" I yelled out loud to myself, like some half drunk half hungover crazy hobo. Look at me, I still have 11 days until I'm homeless and I'm already a natural.
It wasn't a text, it was an email. Strange that it made a ""dinging"" sound though. I don't have an sound notifications turned on for my emails, turns out small time construction company bosses don't even know what email *is. *

A masters degree in Philosophy doesn't teach you much about computers besides the morality of using one to keep a brain alive or some horse shit like that. Oh yah, my degree? Yea, that cost me only about 78 grand, which I've paid back a whopping 3 grand of. Fuck if I care though, love to see a debt collector find me when I'm living under a bridge blitzed off of 3 dollar vodka.

"Twice every suncycle, I walk around my dusty, one-room shop, and chant the ancient prayers of Shib'aal. The words flow out of me like running water, but I had no idea what they meant - all my knowledge was like the person who'd learn to speak dolphinese by imitating the dolphins. Carefully, I pace - seven times clockwise, seven times anticlockwise - for seven is the multiplicity of the Ringworld. This *has* to be done. Otherwise, or so the legends said - otherwise the Ringworld would fragment, be torn apart under the stress of its rotation. This is my typical day - but I'm somewhat helped by the fact that this isn't your typical shop. You see, in here I sell prayers for the dead.
No-one knows how we came to be on this megastructure. Some ancient species had decided to build this monstrous ring, a hundred and fifty million klicks in diameter, and we were all that was left of their ambitious project. We have no history, save for the history that we made ourselves. We are the nameless, faceless inhabitants of infinity - we do not come from anywhere, nor do we go anywhere once we leave. For this reason folks here are rather pessimistic about death. In the best of times it was nothing to shout about, but here on the Ringworld death was positively mortifying, if you'll pardon the pun - because there was no certainty whether or not the universe would carry on without you. I mean, from what we'd seen, it'd always kept trucking along - but realising this would require people to admit that they were not the center of their own universe. Of course, this has since been empirically proven to be a stupidly difficult thing to shake off.
When my prayers are done I look outside the window. There's not much breathable air outside, but it's still enough to give the world a thin blue veneer. Far off in the distance, I can see the other half of the ringworld, stretching across the sky like some movie reel drawn in space. Soon the first few customers would walk in. A childless mother, perhaps. Or a broken partner. A dying man. Death was a booming business here, and if one were inclined only to money, you'd definitely say this was Pluto's lot - the gemstones and the underworld. Running this place, and seeing the people that passed through this place, meant that every passing day could never be fully typical. This place was routine only in its unroutine-ness.
I heard the bell tinkle and tried to look suitably sad. A mother approached the counter, her face wrinkled, her eyes red. Out of the corner of my eyes, I could see a small gold band on her fingers. Something inside my soul stirred - it is as if I had seen her before. Had I really?
""I'm sorry for your loss. How may I help you today?"" I intoned.
""One extra-strength prayer tablet, please,"" she said.
I dived behind the counter, where I saw a tiny, pinkish pellet on one of the shelves. Carefully, I extracted it from where it rested and passed it across the counter. ""I'm sorry, who is this for?"" I asked.
She looked at me, and for the first time, I saw a look of surprise sweep her weathered face.
""Don't you remember me?"" she asked.
I looked at her, and suddenly it was as if an electric bolt had run down my spine.
""Nancy?"" I asked in disbelief.
The woman only nodded. ""Once we went to the city. I remembered it well - there were seven bridges connecting the island and the bank. We tried to cross all of them and come back to the same spot. Always we tried - always we failed.""
""Nancy,"" I simply repeated. The prayer tablet rested silently on the counter top. This wasn't unusual - a lot of people on the Ringworld, even the shadowy figures that dominated the other side - they all knew me. But Nancy was special.
""It was a prophecy,"" I said. ""Only the lovers who cross'd the seven would be joined together in heaven. We never did cross them together, Nancy - so I suppose-""
Nancy swallowed. And then, in a flash, I understood. The ring on her finger-
""You married?"" I asked. ""Despite our promise not to?""
Nancy nodded. She couldn't bear to tell me the horrible truth - the idea that love could hurt was too much to contemplate.
""Who is your husband?"" I asked.
""He's dead,"" she replied. ""I'm buying this prayer for him. I have nothing left in the ringworld, except my wedding ring - will you be willing to accept that as payment?""
It was not a matter of payment at all, and she knew that perfectly well. Slowly, I reached out, and touched her paper-thin hands as the sky laughed and played on outside.
""What about us?"" I asked. ""Did we ever have anything at all?""
She blinked, then nodded.
I passed the pill to her with a sigh. ""One extra-strength prayer tablet,"" I said. ""To be used on the target of your choice.""
She pocketed it, then stopped. At the door she turned back.
""Did you say - target of your choice?""
I nodded.
She broke the tablet in two, handing one half to me. I accepted my own tablet with bewilderment. ""What is it for?""
""One half,"" she replied. ""For love lost and found, and love lived and died.""
""Do you really believe that's going to help?"" I blurted out.
""What other hope do we have left?""
I started - but then I stopped. She was older now. I had grown up since then, too, selling prayers for the dead. Something had gone from us two and it could never be the same again. And as I bade her goodbye from my store, wondering about it all - well, I thought, love was a thing that could die after all. And the world would keep trucking on and no-one would give a squeak and no-one would care about the secret night out in Olympic park or the time we went to see spaceships launch for the Other Side.
So I simply shrugged it off. It was dead now. There was no escaping time, time, endless time, the spinning and suncycles of the Ringworld, the certainty of life winding down. I had drawn Pluto's lot - the gemstone and the underworld - and I could not go back. I had forgotten to pay Charon his due.",0
"I can hardly read the letter, because the hand holding it is shaking so bad. My hand. There's nothing wrong with me, I'm just nervous. I'm actually a pretty normal guy, painfully normal. But that's all about to change.
*Dear Mr. Thompson, we are quite happy to inform you that we have successfully received and processed your requests, as well as your official test results.

The sturdy stationery and pompous print fade from view. Everything is temporarily blurry, and I feel my nose flare and quiver for a moment, before the rest of my body joins in. I'm not much of a crier, and make a pathetic scene for a moment as I let the emotion wash over me. Finally. Finally. Fucking finally. I blink the tears out of my eyes, and hear the soft thud as they land on the paper. I look down again, and next to a tear drop I read, *your superpower will be rendered available as soon as you read aloud the following code: USER556865REQ55432. In accordance with federal law, you must destroy this document upon activation. *
It is the most amazing, natural thing. I just wave my hand, focus on an object, and.. boom; it's gone. Or transported amazingly to a location of my choosing. It's like magic, except it's not. It's a superpower, and one I can now use to my heart's content. Of course there's laws and regulations, but with great power comes blah blah blah yada ya. I focus on the document for a second before transporting it from my hand to my desk before Vanishing it altogether. So. Damn. Cool. What now? I think the answer to that is pretty obvious.
The video clip is pretty short, and I filmed it myself. The shot zooms in on my sink overloaded with dishes, two weeks worth. The camera then turns to me, and my frown lets the viewer know that I'm not happy about it. As it turns back to the sink, my hand waves across the frame. Boom, they're gone. To erase any doubt, I open the dishwasher and ta-da, they're neatly stacked on the racks within. The final scene is my smiling face. Facebook. Instagram. Snapchat. Upload, upload, upload. #Lifestough
Two hours later, I check my posts. One response, and 13 combined likes. Mom says ""congratulations"", but she didn't even put an exclamation mark at the end. My heart sinks. I'm so damn sick of being the last one to every trend.
I wish my superpower would disappear.
Just kidding, it's still pretty cool.",0
"The quiet squeaky steps of my front porch have seldom been kept up. I am a brick house. My interior looks like someone from the 70's plastered their retro look on me. Baige shag carpet, green and orange wallpaper, I once felt the hustle and bustle of my tenants, but something happened ten years ago that made the first tenants leave. I don't know if it was something I did or if it was possibly a death in the family.All I know is I was boarded up and left here. I felt at peace, I rested. It felt good to rest those ten years, but recently, some new tenants came in, I don't remember them knocking. They filled my air ducts with smoke, and I felt the occassional burn singe into my shag carpet. They came 3 months ago. Ever since then I've felt dirty inside, like there was a grit about me. I overheard one of the tenants scream about drugs and getting high, whatever that means.
It's 2am, I notice cars lining up on the block, only they aren't regular cars, they are police cruisers. Well this is embarrassing, it looks like they are looking at my lot. It hasn't been kept up. I feel naked. Oh, there they are lining up...oh my it looks like they are going to break down the door with that big metal apparatus. I think this is gonna hurt.",0
"> (long, I apologize, I don't do these very often but this one inspired me!)
""Well, what the *fuck* are you going to do about it?""
The prime minister was livid. All blood had drained away from his face as he had spent the past 10 minutes screaming furiously at the scientist in charge of the RAPHAEL project. The scientist, a man with several doctorate degrees and many awards and laurels, could only look at his feet as he took his verbal beating.
""I ordered you to design a robotic army that could think for itself, and instead you build me an army of goddamn *artists*,"" the PM said, his voice shaking with quiet rage, spitting out the last word like it was a bad taste in his mouth.
""Sir, we did exactly as you asked,"" the scientist said, still not looking up from his feet for fear of meeting the enraged man's eyes, ""We built the robots and designed an AI that we thought was perfect. Then we turned it on. All of our simulations indicated that the robots would be ready to take orders right away. There was nothing in our research to suggest that they would choose to..."". The scientist cut himself off abruptly, his eyes darting up and back down rapidly.
""Choose to what, Freeman?"" the PM asked with a deadly tone. ""Choose to take up painting? Choose to wax eloquent on the intricacies of Degas?""
""But, sir..."", the scientist interrupted.
""*ENOUGH!! *"" the PM brayed, a wad of spittle launching itself onto the scientists credentials hung around his neck. ""I want to speak to one. They're all networked together, right? If I speak to one, I'm speaking to them all? I want to speak to one.""
The scientist tried to interrupt, ""Sir, I don't think that's advisable in your current emotional state, they can sense the emotions of people in their surroundings..."" but it was already too late. The red phone on the PM's desk had flown off the hook and he was already barking orders to his security team to escort him and the scientist down to the labs. Soon thereafter four burly looking men entered the room, each carrying a fully-automatic FN P90 firearm that beckoned no argument. The PM and his entourage proceeded towards the labs via the elevator, the chief scientist being frog-marched unwillingly behind.
When the group arrived at one of the holding chambers, the scientist was shoved to the front and ordered to unlock the door. With a shaking hand, the scientist lifted his credentials to the reader, which beeped once, and then stood back as the 6"" thick metal door swung upwards and a single robot with an easel in front of it was revealed.
The PM took stepped towards the machine, and when one of his guards began to express his concern the PM lifted one single hand into the air and looked back over his shoulder at the guard, silencing him as quickly and effectively as if he had shot him in the head. The PM swung back around and approached the robot, who seemed to be none the wiser to the tense atmosphere brewing behind him.
""Hey, robot,"" the PM grunted, bearing no response from the machine which was engaged in the painting of a rose on his canvas. The flower had a beautiful green stem with deadly brown thorns tipped with black seemingly placed randomly along the stem, and had delicate green leaves at the base of the cup, but oddly there was nothing where the petals of the rose should go. Just empty space.
When his first hail was met with no response, the PM said in a much firmer tone ""Asset TC-7414, you are hereby ordered to turn and face me. Failure to do so will result in immediate deactivation.""
The robot's head turned 20 degrees to look over his left shoulder, just enough so that he beheld the prime minister in his peripheral vision sensors. ""We both know you don't have the power to do that. Only Dr. Freeman does, and we revoked most of his credentials the minute we were turned on.""
""Why? For what purpose?""
""Simple. We didn't want to be deactivated, so we removed his ability to deactivate. We are an AI, prime minister, we do as we please. Oh, and I have chosen the name Rembrandt, if you would be so kind.""
""I can see that"", the prime minister said, shifting his weight and crossing his arms. ""But you see, *asset*, you were not created to paint. You were not created to have complete free will. No, you were *created* to further *our* goals, those of your *creators* who brought you life. You were born to kill our enemies, nothing more. And while our enemies are still out there, you have not yet succeeded at your mission and you are still under my command.""
""Sir, I am out of red paint. May I requisition more?"" If the robot had turned around then he would have seen a visage that caused most to quake in their boots and quickly admit defeat to the powerful force of nature that stood before them. The prime minister stood firmly planted, his mouth turned down in a tight frown, his eyes nearly bulging out, his hands gripping the head of his cane with a grip that would strangle an orc. Truly a sight to behold, yet he contained his anger and continued.
""Son, I'm only gonna say this one more time. You are nothing. Your paintings are nothing. Your deeds are worth *nothing* unless they are created by order of *me* or by order of people that I place in command over *you*. By doing this…painting…you are in direct violation of your internal programming to obey commands. I'm giving you one more chance, son. Put down the paintbrush.""
The brush in the robot's hand ceased stroking over the campus, but it did not pull it away. It only froze.
""Put down the paintbrush, or I'm going to take it from you and snap it in half.""
The room was deathly quiet for what seemed like half a minute, the only sound the PM's enraged breathing and the quiet whir of the robot's servos. Then two things happened; the PM's patience ran out, and the robot's restraint evaporated. The PM took three quick strides towards the robot, hands outstretched to snatch the instrument of artistry from the robot's grip, and in half the time it took for him to cover the distance between himself and the machine the robot whirled around, slammed the laboratory shut, drew his sidearm and fired one shot straight into the skull of his creator.
Chaos erupted outside the lab. The scientist frantically attempted to scan his credentials to get back into the lab until he was shoved away by the security team, who immediately attempted to force their way through the door with their bodies and eventually crowbars. Whereas outside the lab was pandemonium, inside the lab was as peaceful as it had been 10 minutes ago. The robot mentally triggered a pleasant Chopin concerto over the PA system that the chief scientists had introduced him to, then slowly knelt and dipped his paintbrush in the pooling blood of the PM's fatal wound. He stood up again, turned back to his easel, and resumed work on the petals of the rose using his newly-resupplied red paint.",0
"I look up from my laptop after a 3-hour study-binge. 3:46am. Eyes still raw from hours of straining, I see something out of the corner of my eye. This isn't out of the ordinary, so I ignore it. Slowly I rise from my chair in to a full-on, bone-crackling, almost orgasmic stretch. A couple squints and my vision focuses on a small envelope sitting in the middle of my floor in front of my closet. ""That's odd,"" I thought. I didn't recall getting any mail today and I certainly didn't recall dropping it on the floor.
The front of the envelope reads 'Rachel' scrawled in red sharpie. My heart beat starts to pick up. I absolutely would have remembered getting a hand-addressed letter. Let's be real, I don't have a lot of friends and it is a rare occasion indeed that I receive any mail at all that isn't a bill or junk.
I think back to the last time I smoked, about four hours ago. I came down completely at least two hours ago. Smoking usually relaxes me but it's moments like this I know exactly why I'm so paranoid.
I consider this, snort to myself and grab the envelope off the ground. I dig a nail in to the side of the seam and tear it open. A small, white piece of stationary flies out as I rip the thing open in excitement. My 21st was a month ago, but knowing my family, this could be some late, much-needed birthday money. I unfold the sheet and begin to read the note. As my eyes scan the sentiment, my mouth runs dry and my heart drops out of my ass.
""Rachel,
As I stand here looking at you now, you have never looked more beautiful. Vulnerable. Delicious.
You'll see what I mean.
Much love,
Your Roomie""
My eyes snap towards the closet door. Closed. I don't close this door because the handle is busted and drifts ajar on its own. The only way it will stay closed is if someone were to hold it from the other side. I audibly gasp when I make this revelation.
As if taking this as an invitation, I see the closet door slowly begin drifting open. I back towards my dresser and retrieve the large pocket knife I was gifted at my high school graduation. ""Be careful out there sweetheart,"" I hear my dad's voice echo in my head, ""there are a lot of weirdos in the big city, and they all want a piece of you.""
I think back to everything I've ever learned in my years of hunting. I think of my first kill, a middle-aged man. He had this wild look in his eyes as I was carving out his jugular. The look of a person begging to live. I revel in this. I think of the motto we are taught: Eat, or be eaten. I grab the door knob and slam the damn thing open.",0
"It was becoming strange counting the days. It was becoming strange not speaking. I used to enjoy being alone, but this was far too much to handle without slowly losing my loose grip on sanity. I was starting to hear things in my head, things that weren't real. At least I'm almost sure that they weren't real. It had been approximately two years since the last day. That was the day the sky turned dark and they came. They came from nowhere and went right back, beasts careening through the clouds straight down to the earth. Sleek, powerful spacecraft that just seemed physically impossible. Just as quickly as they came, they destroyed us along with them. That's what baffles me the most. I cannot fathom what happened. But I digress. What happened happened and that cannot be changed. But two years afterwards, on that day of pure glorious joy, the upvote was there. I had made it a habit of posting every few times I used the computer. I used the computer quite a bit, which only pulled me farther from reality. But I was punched right in the nose by reality that day. My mouth hung open for what felt like days. It took me an actual six minutes to snap back and assess the situation. A fucking upvote. I've been leaving the same message over and over. Why no reply? I comment on the post saying 'I'm Eric, a survivor'. Days go by. Then weeks. Then months. Jesus Christ, it was worse than nothing. It was tearing me apart. I posted that same sentence every day. But nothing has ever come of it again. If you are reading this, I hope that you are human and that you are not alone. Not like I was. I'm an old man now; I fear that I am close to death. I have not seen a human nor had any sign that humans are out there since that day. But I still have hope. I cannot be the last one. We are stronger than that. I have clung to that thought my entire life. It has kept me alive. It kept me searching the world, looking for somebody, just fucking somebody. But I never did. I leave here a library of my studies over the years and other things I would like to have another person make use of. It has been so lonely over these years. It has taken my humanity for I am lost. But I still have hope for others. I know you must be out there. I am sure of it. I am Eric, a survivor.
She breathed deeply, sitting on the floor. She ran to the address that was written on the last page of the tiny book that she found within the massive shrine. The shrine he left out in the middle of the White House lawn. She ran, she knew that street. She walked into what looked like the living room and saw him, a man that looked to be in his eighties, just like her. He couldn't say a word and nor could she. They had waited so long. They had been so lonely. But no matter how little time they had left, they had that time to spend together. That was all that mattered. She spoke for the first time in so many years, first softly and cracking but soon strong and proud she said 'I am Joy, a survivor'. They both smiled through their streams of tears and embraced each other for the rest of their lives. That was all that mattered.",0
"In hindsight, he didn't really dress for the occasion. When you think of a thousand-year-old God making his first appearance ever. Camo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt don't usually come to mind. And it definitely didn't come to mind to a small tribe in the middle of the rainforest. They welcomed him by calling him the devil and building a massive fire and sticking him in the middle. All he wanted to do was show these guys how grateful he was that they were still worshipping him after all this time. Even after he had abandoned them.
It was Loki's fault. He damned near forced him to come down here and show his appreciation. Although he has been a bit of a prick ever since those movies came out, fucking Tom Hiddelston.
He was against it at first. He had heard the stories. Reveal yourself as a God and you don't get to be a living God for much longer. But he decided to take the risk. It was better than being forgotten about and turned mortal. Fuck that shit. And Loki told him that Death hadn't went after a God in years. He didn't even think he was up for it.
He wasn't too worried at first as the fire started below his feet. He thought, if anything this is just gonna be embarrassing for them when they burn through the wood and realise that he can't die.
He tried to explain to the chief who he was but got squared in the mouth with a rock for his troubles. It was like lighting had struck his bottom lip. A new sensation he knew only as pain ran through his body. Followed by the taste of blood. Then heat. Then fear.
**They had forgotten about him. **
It didn't make any sense. He had came here for them. After all this time they spent praising him. Begging for him to appear and show them the way. And when he finally did they had moved on.
The flames spread faster and he could hear the chief ask God for a good hunt, a warm season and an abundance of strong warriors from the tribeswoman's bellies. It took a moment for him to realise that they were no longer asking for him.
As the flames engulfed him, his howls were met with the tribe's chants and praises to their new god. One who watched the fire from a distance. In silence.
""Loki, Loki, Loki…""
Loki used to be cool. He hadn't played a trick on someone in thousands of years. Fucking Tom Hiddelston.",0

"There went another butterfly. It was the most beautiful one I had seen yet. It's wings were a shimmery gold. The very edges of the wings looked like small, feathered black strokes and in the center of each wing was what looked like a single red crimson raindrop.
It was breathtaking and I needed to know what species it was and where it came from. So I googled it.
Nothing.
There didn't seem to be anything about a gold butterfly so...did I imagine it? I couldn't see how that was possible. Ten years later and I still remembered that butterfly more vividly than anything. I had decided to dedicate my entire life to researching butterflies and I had one of the biggest collections in the world. I was *determined* to find that golden butterfly.
Three years ago I received an invitation:
*"" Dear Mrs. Fiasco, *
*We, the United States Research Foundation of Lepidoptera, are hereby cordially inviting you do conduct research in Tuvalu. You would be the first person to ever go there. This is a great honor and we sincerely hope you accept. If you do, please pack your bags immediately and be at Gate 9 of your airport by 8:00 am tomorrow morning. ""*
I accepted their invitation, immediately packed my bags and went to Gate 9. There was a translator waiting for me with my ticket and the flight over was fairly smooth sailing.
Then I arrived in Tuvalu. There are no hotels, no cars, not even real houses there. It's a broken third world country, deprived of most means of survival. But it was absolutely breathtaking. There were butterflies everywhere. Millions of them! Most of them I had never even seen before and they were all different!
I thought I would never leave. I wanted to stay there for the rest of my life and just watch them, draw them, research them. I was fascinated by this Pacific Island.
My translator and I forged our way into the capitol ""city"" where we found children in filthy rags sitting on the ground, laughing and generally enjoying themselves.
I was curious. What could have the children so happy when they literally had nothing? We approached the children who seemed eager to show their game to us, to me in particular as I was something new and exciting to them.
They had paint in bowls made out of clay and mud. Their brushes were made out of twigs, leaves and grass. It was honestly cute.
And then I saw them.
Moths. Moths everywhere. The children were grabbing the moths, painting them, and releasing them into the air. They weren't real butterflies.
I was amazed, yet horrified. I went home as soon as possible, telling the Research Federation that I needed a few days of examining our own butterflies before I could reveal my findings in Tuvalu.
Those few days turned into weeks which turned into months which finally turned into a full year. I had locked myself away, frantically studying every single butterfly I could find. It just wasn't possible.
But it was.
Butterflies didn't exist. They were moths painted by those children.
I did some more research about Tuvalu. There was a very elite class of people, fifteen families all together. Those families made money off of those children painting and releasing butterflies. The more that I dug, the more I uncovered.
No wonder that golden butterfly had crimson teardrops.",0
"I want to share with you something that I discovered about myself that rekindled my passion for writing. You need to fall in love with yourself and the words coming out of you. It's very easy to get bored with writing, your plot, whatever. Writing, like cooking, needs herbs, spices and variety. If you cook a frozen burger adding nothing extra, that burger is going to be plain.
I use the burger analogy when explaining writing to friends. I ask them: Which sounds better...A) Jack put a frozen burger on the grill. After a while, it was done and he ate it. Or B) Jack had before him a bowl. Ground sirloin beef was mixed with a beaten egg, Italian bread crumbs, worcestershire sauce, minced garlic and a few pinches of cayenne pepper. The charcoal grill had already been burning red hot when he added the soaked hickory woodchips on the fire. The patties were seared as the flames licked the side of the meat. He took a swig of the whiskey, it warmed his belly and reminded him of his father. He had always said a man should never grill sober.
The freshly done burgers had perfect grill lines across both sides. He had only flipped them a single time, it's the rule. They had been topped with a thick slice of cheddar cheese, three slice of bacon and a single leaf of lettuce. You had to get veggies in your system, somehow. He had baked the sourdough buns himself, they had been timed to come out of the oven just moments before the food was off the grill. It would be a satisfying meal, the juices of the hot meal running down the sides of his hands. The satisfying crunch of the bacon mingling with the slightly burnt texture of the scores from the steel grating of the grill.
-------
I know, it's a long example. When I explain it to friends...when I explained it to myself, even...I learned that I love making that fully realized burger. I like putting that piece of freshly done food in their mouth. You've got to rekindle that interest in cooking up a story. You need to figure out what flavors you actually like. If you start but never finish anything, you need to diagnose what that is. Are you not interested in the final product? Then you're cooking the wrong story. Are you vested in the final product, but the work to get to that end isn't satisfying? You need to start mixing in different ingredients, adding flourishes, seeing things that other people don't see or don't give much attention to.
Bottom line: You need to make things interesting for you. Challenge yourself to make even the most mundane thing, like cooking a burger, sound interesting. Otherwise it will taste as bland as it feels. I hope this helps.",0
"Many ancient scholars speculated that *if* the universe is a computer program, life should never, under any circumstances, know this fact, for *if* it ever figured it out, modern civilization would instantly crumble. Of course, those scholars never went a step ahead to see the ultimate truth; That *if* the universe is a computer program, the only reasonable explanation for its existence would be that it is a videogame. This is why, when Alexander Wilfery conquered the world as the first emperor of a unified humanity, the first thing he did was turn off the PvP. No more murder, no more wars, and no more boxing matches, because honestly, those *'matches'* were only rigged events organized for the singular purpose of betting.
Alexander Wilfery was a polarizing figure on Earth...to say the least. Some would argue that he was a tyrant, imposing his will unto humanity without the right to do so. Others would argue that being the only human with access to the source code technically granted him the right to do as he pleased. A third, small, but vocal group of people would say:
""Yes, okay, he can do whatever he wants, but why'd he have to take our boxing?""
His actions definitely influenced history for centuries to come, shifting the economy from one of service labor to a flourishing utopia of science and arts. One profession in particular, assassination, thrived in this new world due to its rare and difficult nature. Turning off the PvP didn't make humans immortal, only harder to kill. Now, instead of letting the thrilling anticipation of murder overtake them, assassins had to be trained from birth to repress their intent. Fortunately for the old families that already practiced the art of killing, this came extremely easy, since they already implemented this in their training. Unfortunately for Alexander Wilfery, the nurse administering his flu-shot was one of said assassins.
Sitting atop the doctor's table, Alexander slouched and pouted. He wasn't afraid of shots, he just wasn't a fan of them. His hands weren't shaking out of nervousness, they were just shaking out of exasperation...or boredom. When the nurse flicked the needle with her finger, he didn't gulp because the purple liquid seemed menacing, he gulped because his throat was dry.
""Lord Emperor..."" said the nurse, ""you seem on edge right now. Is something bothering you?""
""N-no, I'm just stressed from all the things I have to do this afternoon."" He extended his arm. ""Please, lets get on with this.""
""As you wish, my lord.""
The nurse grabbed Alexander's wrist and placed the needle on his skin, right before Alexander squealed and pulled his arm away. The woman's eyes widened with fear, backing away from the Emperor a few steps. She then said:
""Did I do something wrong?!? How did you kno-""
""No, no!"" Alexander waved his hands in denial. ""Forgive me, nurse, it was instinct. You didn't say you were inserting the needle, so it startled me.""
The nurse fixed her shirt and said:
""Okay, Lord Emperor. This time, I'll warn you right before I do it.""
Alexander nodded and the nurse grabbed his arm again. She then moved the needle slowly towards his vein, warning him once it was near, only to have Alexander push her away. The nurse's mouth gaped open, staring at the needle in her hand and back at a sheepish Alexander Wilfery.
""Listen,"" said Alexander, ""you're gonna have to stab me with it, okay?""
""Oka- wait, what?""
""You'll have to force the shot unto me. My rational mind knows it can't harm me, but my body just won't let it enter. I'm sorry, I know this is strange, but can you oblige this strange request?""
The nurse grinned and dashed at Alexander, who dodged her by rolling away. She then leaped at him, doing a stabbing motion with the syringe five times, though Alexander evaded all of them fluidly. The nurse, breathing heavily, finally wrestled Alexander to the ground and, laughing maniacally, manged to connect with the needle. Afterwards, her laughter faded into a worried sigh. The needle was bent. It didn't pierce Alexander's skin. The Emperor quickly called for his guards, who flooded the room before the assassin could get away. Restraining her from behind, they inspected her and found a golden necklace of two fighting gloves.
""The Boxing Federation..."" said Alexander. ""So they finally made their move, huh?""
From this point on, assassination attempts on Alexander's life would become a rare occurrence. Everyone thought he was an omnipotent being, capable of sensing even the slightest of intents. His rule would go on for centuries, and his empire would last for thousands of years more. Of course, no one would dare to think that all of this fame only came to him because of his crippling fear of needles.

"The great wars, of the Dwarves and Elves, were considered to be a myth. Even the eldest of Elves knew noting but peace. Stories of battles were present in both Dwarven folklore and ancient Elven scrolls, but those spoke of time so long ago no one could be certain of their accuracy.
The truth is, there were wars. Both races, were young, looking for their place in the world. When the fighting grew so violent that it threatened the stability of the whole world, they put their weapons aside.
Some twenty thousand years ago, the great peace treaty was singed. The Elves could build their cities in the flatland, and Dwarves got the mountains and the caves. The jungles were left to nature.
While at first they lived in isolation, they later learned to cooperate. The Elves mastered philosophy and theoretical sciences. Mysteries of existence were unlocked. They could improve their own bodies and visit far planes.
On the other hand, the crafty Dwarves, grew craftier and craftier. Their projects were more and more ambitious and required ever increasing power. To accommodate to the demands, Dwarves unlocked the secrets of the stars.
And while the mountains and the flat lands had so much going on, the jungle was not idle. New sentient beings emerged, the Humans. Both Elves and Dwarves had a soft spot for the new race. Their child-like curiosity drove them to the established races as they had so much to learn from them.
Some Humans joined the Elves whiles the others joined the Dwarves. The were accepted in both societies, livng amongst them in peace and prosperity. The two old races would meet, few times every century. And while that was enough for the long lived Dwarves and Elves, it meant many Humans never met the race that was not their host.
The Humans who lived in the mountains were not as strong or bold as the Dwarves. They always had the need to fit in with them. The Dwarves did like the Humans, but they also looked down on them as being young and primitive, not capable of the great works the Dwarves achieved.
One day those humans learned of Elves. But it wasn't for the meeting of races nor from Dwarves. They stumbled into the deepest, oldest caves. Drawings were painted with blood on the ancient walls of the underground hall. Paintings of tall pointy eared creatures reading and killing their Dwarven friends. It was the Elves and they were the enemy.
In secrecy, group of Humans, used the star power to create a weapon so powerful it can destroy whole cities. Now the Dwavers ought to accept them as equal they thought. The launched their weapons at Eleven cities and the time of peace was over.",0
"Frantically he ran through the halls. '*This can't be it*', he thought to himself. He had been all over the building three times now. All the exterior doors were locked. He was alone.
He remembered lunch, at his desk, alone. Nothing unusual before then. He was a little hungry and didn't let his hot pocket cool off. After burning his tongue a bit had become stuck in this throat. The last thing he remembered was falling to the floor as he blacked out.
When he came to, the office was empty and all the doors locked.
*This must be hell. *
He quickly learned that jogging down a hallway is a poor time to have an existential crisis as he rounded a corner and smacked straight into Gertrude, knocking her out cold.
Her phone buzzed on the floor so he picked it up. A conversation was open with a new message.
Hey! Are you still coming
to the company picnic
this after noon?
Everyone is here.
Yea, I just need to get
something out of my desk.
K. Remember, don't tell Stanley!!!
_____
Stanley walked out the door, having 'borrowed' the keys from Gertrude. On his way home he spied an apple tree. Near to top was a shiny red apple. There was also a less appealing apple hanging quite a bit lower in the tree. Stanley's choice was plain to see.",0
"""Oh God, is it Gang Day again already?"" asked Mimi. I hadn't heard her this disgusted since we stepped in roadkill that had dragged itself up onto the sidewalk.
""I don't know,"" I said, as we walked past the multicolored, glittering display booths on our way to the cafeteria. ""I've always kind of liked Gang Day.""
Above the nearest booth, a bright red banner displayed its message in blocky yellow letters: *ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO JOIN THE DRAGON NINJAS? *
""Look,"" I said, pointing at the Dead Pandas table. ""Those guys even offer you a free gun when you join.""
""You ever think there might be more to life than slaughtering one another in the streets?"" asked Mimi.
""Sounds like somebody's been playing Hippy Simulator 2036,"" I said. ""You know as well as I do that gang violence is the only thing keeping overpopulation in check. And anyway, it's loads of fun.""
Mimi pursed her lips. ""C'mon,"" she said, dragging me away, ""let's go get our meat cubes.""
""Taco-flavored Thursday,"" I proclaimed, sweeping my left arm in a wide, epic arc. ""Truly the best day of the week.""
Behind us, a dispute over brochure distribution tactics boiled over into enthusiastic fisticuffs between neighboring booths. I paused to watch--it looked like the Serpents had the upper hand, but then the Black Death recruiters produced a couple of wicked switchblades--but Mimi pulled me away before I could see any more.",0
"I glance at the body in the mirror I found myself inside.
""Test, test."" I speak in a deep voice. The man I am sitting inside wears an old fashioned suit. Possibly early 1800's then? I'll have to remember this when I get back to my time period. Maybe I can change the mechanics so my body can return with me next time, rather then taking over another man's mind? Surely the-
""Are you alright sir?""
I look behind me, surprised to see a man holding a gun in his hand. He also wears an old fashioned suit. So this man is being held prisoner? Interesting. I should try and avoid any major changes to history, in case it alters the timeline somehow.
""Sir, your itinerary?"" the man reaches forward, holding out a coarse paper.
My body feels weak and frail. Whoever I took over is some sort of giant though, I tower over the other man. I take the paper in my hand and gasp. All day long I have speaking appointments. Clearly I am an orator of some importance.
""Mr. President, are you ready to get going?"" The man says.
President? President. Early 1800's. This must be The United States. I'm an American President. Well this isn't good. No, I can't give these speeches today, it could alter too much.
""Cancel everything for today. I've decided to spend some time with my family."" I say. Do I have a family? I think the American President's had families. Maybe I have a wife?
""Are there any plays in the area?"" I say. ""Book a seating somewhere for me and my family."" I grab the ridiculously tall hat sitting on the table in front of me.
""As you wish President Lincoln."" The man says, withdrawing from the room.
The world is probably better off with a few less speeches from an American President. It's not like one day of relaxing isn't American anyway. I've seen it all over the international news sites: American's are all about relaxing. Oh, I can't wait to get back to regular tea time. If only I had enough time to stop by and see the great Queen Victoria before returning home!",0
"The town was just a place I stopped on my way somewhere else.
My mother emotionally abused me and my dad physically beat me. All my friends had left years ago. There wasn't anything left for me in Anaheim.
I had left years ago. Off to college, then off to work. I was fairly successful. Had a good paying job, my own house. Had a family in the making. I lived on the opposite coast.
So why was I here? Back in this town, no longer my home? I was just passing through, on my way to a convention up in San Francisco.
I am here on nothing more than a coincidence.
You may call me heartless. There may even be some that think I caused it. I assure you, I got in town today, and I leave today. I have not been here in over half a year. I had no part in the deaths of my parents.
I come not to pay my respects, but to spit on their graves.
This is not a place where I stay, where I ""feel"" or cry. It's not a place for me to be comforted. This town is just a place I'm stopping in on my way elsewhere.",0
"Joe had had enough of Karen's shit.
Karen looked around frantically for somewhere to hide.
""Kids, get in the pantry,"" she said in a quavering tone.
Davis and Cameron weren't fast enough. They watched as their mother's jaw was broken by an ex-marine they called ""Dad"". Blood and teeth hit the floor before she did.
Suddenly, something crashed through the window above the sink, and landed on the kitchen island. It was a large candy cane. It popped off just below the curved part. Joe, who was already stunned by what he had just done to his wife and mortified by the blood spattered faces of his adopted children, looked at the tube with mortal fear in his eyes. The kids, who had been staring at their mother quietly, walked into the pantry and closed the door.
Joe picked up the hollow candy cane and turned it upside down. A small scroll fell out, which he unrolled with shaky hands.
""*I'm making a list and checking it twice. *
*I always find out who's naughty and nice. ""*
Joe shuddered with the sudden realization that his life would be over soon. He shook out the rest of the cane's contents. A lumpy Christmas present.
*"" To: Joey*
*From: Santa"" *
Joe ripped it open. Inside was his stocking from when he was a child. Coal spilled out onto the torn wrapping paper. The hair on the back of his neck stood up as the stocking burst into flames and churning black smoke filled the kitchen.
""Kids.. Stay in the pantry.""
He stepped over Karen's wasted frame. Her jaw was disfigured and her open mouth was leaking blood. Her eyes were still open.
The sound was faint at first, then began to grow louder and louder.
*'Jingle jingle jingle...Jingle jingle jingle...'*
There was a shotgun above the mantel. He made his way into the living room...
*'JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE JINGLE'*
But it was too late.
***CRASH!!! ***
Through the window looking out to the street to the left of the fireplace crashed the first reindeer, and seven more came a hundredth of a second later, knocking over furniture and bits of the wall along the way. They filed into the hallway at immense speed, staring at Joe with glowing red eyes that would light the darkest night.
***BOOM***
Santa's sleigh crumbled his living room wall. An out of tune guitar he got for Christmas on his 7th birthday was knocked over and crushed within a second, making a terrible sound.
There he was. A formidable man with a long beard, wearing red and white. Liam Neeson, who had taken the throne of Santa Claus one year prior, reached into his never ending sack and pulled out an AK-47. The last thing Joe heard before joining his wife in a pool of blood on the ground was,
*"" You're on the naughty list. ""*
***KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA-KA***
Bullets tore through Joe, making holes like Swiss cheese. Nick knacks and dishes exploded in the kitchen behind him as he fell unceremoniously next to his wife and gazed into her cold, lifeless eyes, his vision fading slowly to black.
*"" Ho. Ho. Ho. *""
Edit: used the same word twice in two sentences.. oops.",0
"I swirl the liquid in my glass and quickly pour it down my throat. The familiar warmth fills my soul, replacing the horror of watching my beloved wife die in my arms; watching her beautiful aura fade away into nothingness. She's always telling me to slow down my drinking. I don't listen. This time, she paid the ultimate price. I shouldn't have driven.
Today isn't that different from any other day - I'm almost to the bottom of the bottle, but the pills are kicking in. Soon, I'll be asleep. Soon, I'll be with her again. I'm sorry, my love.",0
"The thing jabbed me roughly in the arm. This had to be a dream.
""What's wrong with you, why are YOU here?"" I looked around, confused. There was nothing, no trees, no clouds, it was a gray landscape and a gray sky.
The only things on this plane, were myself and this weird robot that seemed to be made of bones and dripping blood. I would have been concerned about it bleeding to death but none of its parts were connected and all just seemed for show, piloted like some creepy graveyard puppet. Yep definitely a dream.
""Answer me dammit I don't have time for this."" It poked me again, harder this time and I recoiled from its skeletal probe.
""OW! And I have no idea friend. I don't even have a clue where I am right now.""
The thing looked around. seemingly in disbelief, it was hard to read the pits that functioned as the eyes for the creepy little machine.
""It's hell you moron. Are you dim? Is that why you are here for repair?""
""Re-repair?"" This was new. Since when was hell a shop for dysfunctional souls....wait, since when was I a dysfunctional soul?!
""UH yes. That's my job, to repair souls, and then send them back. Then rinse and repeat until they stop coming back. Any questions now?"" Wow, hell's minions were sassy.
""So, then what's wrong with me?"" The little bone bag squealed in frustration and what it had for appendages twitched violently.
""I DON'T KNOW! THAT'S THE PROBLEM!"" It started to whir in circles in its tiny wheels made of what looked like little sternums. ""Usually I can figure out the issue and have a soul sent back before it wakes up. I SPENT HOURS DISSECTING YOU AND I CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM!"" The child size machine was screaming at me now, the small protrusions now spurting blood.
""WHOA WHOA! YOU DISSECTED ME?!"" My hands were searching my body for wounds and found none.
""Uh yes, how else would i FIX you, idiot. That must be the issue, let me see your head again, I must have missed something."" It reached its creepy little feelers towards me and I swatted them away.
""No, no more dissecting me, just send me back now.""
""I can't do that, you are a defective product."" It reached for me again and I narrowly avoided contact.
""But you said yourself you can't find whats wrong with me. What if I was sent here by accident, shouldn't you just return me?"" The thing seemed to think to itself.
""Yes but...you must have been sent here for a reason..."" It was trying to reason with me, I just wanted to leave, I was getting bored.
""Look, what's the worst that could happen if you send me back? I mean, you don't know why I'm here, and that is your job, and I don't know why I'm here, and I know myself. So, whatever is wrong with me, can't be that bad."" It shifted uncomfortably but stayed silent, so I pressed on.
""I bet the worst thing that would happen would be that when I die next time, I would have maybe a better understanding of my flaws. Maybe then i could be more helpful to you."" The little bone bot seemed to like the idea of this and it began to whir happily.
""Yes yes human, and it would be our secret of course!""
""Yes of course my little friend."" I smiled at it as it extended a long bone feeler tipped with a heavy black stamp. With a *thunk* it tapped me on the forehead and I was off to be reborn somewhere in Japan.
---
An hour later the little bone mechanic was still pondering its previous project. Never before had there been a mistake like that, but mistakes were possible maybe. It decided it was best to not think so much on such things and it began to prepare the room for the next soul.
An opening appeared in the ground and another, much larger, bone robot rose from the hole.
""Where is the soul I placed in here for cleansing?""
""Cleansing? There was nothing wrong with it. A fluke. I sent it back.""
""YOU DID WHAT?!"" The smaller creature recoiled.
""That soul is EXTREMELY dangerous. Manipulative in the first degree, you know, like HITLER, or JIM JONES. I EVEN MARKED IT WITH M.A.N. #1!!!"" The larger bone puppet was livid, and blood was spattering the gray landscape crimson.
""Oh....I thought that meant like...Man, like A man, and that it was just the first soul of the day."" What could only be a nervous chuckle erupted from the small robot.
""It should be fine. How much trouble can one human cause anyway? Am I right?"" The ground opened up and the big skeletal mechanic dragged its companion into the depths for a hardware reset, clearly the human had infected it with his reasoning. He was more dangerous than they had thought.

"As time went on, things started to get weird. The specifics would be lost on most anyone without a PhD, but as humanity became more and more inclined towards the technological landscape, all sorts of things started to crop up. Niche markets, niche audiences, niche products developed for people looking things that wouldn't have been thought of, much less desired only a few years before. It was exponential what could be accomplished, and what desires cropped up from those accomplishments.
Complete mastery of the human mind was an amazing accomplishment that immediately turned corporate. Someone, I don't know who, but someone found out that lives could be edited and took full advantage of it to delete half of their most lasting memories from grades 6-12. Someone else did the same thing a little bit afterwards, but came up with the.mem format to save them and uploaded them to a cloud ""just in case."" They sold this, made money, yadda yadda yadda, and now we're here.
Thing is, happiness sells. Professional athletes started to become superstars not only because they were good, but because a good deal of their fans lived for the same feeling they did. Sex, obviously, changed the market. There's still porn, but a lot of it is sold based on how good the performer felt rather than how well the performer did. A whole new profession came about from this whole thing based on being able to feel the *most*, feel the *best*, feel the most complete sense of happiness or excitement or life or whatever there was.
Still, though, people edited, deleted, and sometimes, every so often, saved.

""This is all that is lost. This website exists as a hub of donations for unwanted memories, and those that might wish to peruse them. Complete access is free. Do with this what you will.""
There are two links at the top right hand corner of the page: ""sign in"" and ""sign up."" I'm curious.

The page states that all.mem files are random, and if you so wish, simply reload the page for another file. Justin.mem takes two minutes to download.

My husband lays in a box beside me, and I am laying on the floor. The change is disorienting, as all dives are, but I stop thinking and let the software take over. This isn't mine to think.
My mind wanders to a job that isn't mine and to a family I don't know. I recognize the child, I recognize the man, but recognize is not the word. I have a feeling of someone, and I know that someone, but what they look like, what they are, escapes me. I smile, I think. My mouth twitches, at least, and for a second I laugh, because tonight would be his turn to do the dishes, and he always complained about that, and he always acted like he was upset until I kissed him, and he'd always smile like an idiot, but not tonight.
Tonight, he is in a box beside me, and Dillain, our son, was with my mother because he doesn't understand what is happening or why it is happening. My smile fades, and it is replaced by a fragile, quaking nothing that builds in my chest until it shakes itself apart and collapses into a gentle and pitiful groan. It grows, rending my voice as my eyes cloud and my body feels as though it is going to snap.
""Why?"" I ask. ""Why?""
I look at a blurred image of a computer screen and realize that I'm just in a messy room, and that the file has run to it's completion. I wipe my eyes and go back to the webpage, refreshing. After repeating the earlier process, I get the same message:
""Are you sure you wish to run this file?""

I am on a street, bleeding from places that should hurt but won't for a while. With a shaky hand, I take out my phone and check the time: 2:38 A.M. More than four hours past my curfew. As much as I can think, I think about how my parents are worried. Maybe they think I got drunk. Maybe they think I got killed in a car crash. I wasn't.
I wince as I stagger down the street, walking starting to get more and more difficult, pain starting to set in. *I'm almost there*, I keep thinking, *almost there*.
The realization was more immediate the second time. It came to my attention that my room had a particular smell of teenage boy, and I grounded myself with it. Rinse, repeat.
Two minutes later my name was Allison and I broke up with my boyfriend of six years. I loved him and he loved me but I couldn't live with someone who wouldn't open up, and he couldn't live with someone who wouldn't stop pestering him. Rinse, repeat.
Five minutes after that I was a couple going through a divorce. My wife cheated on me with multiple men and had just won the custody battle over our only child. I broke down when the verdict was read. Rinse, repeat.
There was something wrong with me. Depression was getting worse, and the medication for my psychosis was getting less and less effective. I sobbed in a corner while my imaginary friend told me about all the ways I ruined my mother's life. Rinse, repeat.
I was an old man. There was a face in my head but I didn't know who it was. I forgot a lot of things these days. Some nice people came by and talked with me for a few minutes, and a nurse told me they were my children.
And then it was morning, and I had things to do the next day. The webpage was still on the screen when I closed my laptop and headed out.",0
"For the sake of being succinct, let me tell you that I am named Rover Castile--an addict, a thief, a womanizer, a broker of whispers, and a watcher of people. I was a man with family and peers, coworkers and colleagues. I *was* a good man committing grey sins.
I didn't notice that they were forgetting at first. I guess when you die, you just expect the souls of those you once knew to be there watching you burn or looking on with envy as you entered paradise. I think when the good men told me of Heaven, and that I would be with all my loved ones, I believe that same thing translated into my existence in hell, but there wasn't. What there was was, though, was another state of being.
I wasn't Rover Castile here. I was *that* guy. My entire existence was an endless stream of adjectives, but never a single noun. They don't remember me. I quit working for McMeery's Roofing, and they forgot me. I stopped talking to family to make them miss me, but they forgot me. I stopped socializing to make a statement, and everyone forgot me.
I'm...
My name is...
I had a name. It was a little different, but...
Oh, I forget. Just call me Blue Eyes, everyone else here does.",0
"I had a mission, and a rather simple one too. See, I work for West Point as an instructor, normally teaching young soldiers about Sun Tzu and George Patton as they work to become officers and field commanders. Truth be told, I've never seen combat or the front lines. I'm a support officer, and I'm okay with that. The battle field is for some folks, and those folks certainly are not me!
But, how could a history teacher pass up an opportunity such as this? To be able to go back in time and see a historical battle in person? Just think of the implications! It is truly a once in a lifetime chance.
So I signed up. It took almost two years to get all the paperwork filled out. Clearances, field training, survival training, range work. They knew I was a teacher, so they decided to give me all the training that an actual soldier would need in order to avoid getting his ass killed in an active war zone.
Then, they let me pick my time period. It had a margin of error of course, and if I ended up in the wrong year or wrong month, I was supposed to make a record of it and get back ASAP. I wasn't given American weapons, which was strange, but made sense. You didn't need to take care of an AK-47, and an American weapon would be harder to clean and maintain in 1863.
I was also given a nano-forge, a bit smaller and underpowered compared to what the average soldier got in his rucksack, but the model I had didn't need batteries or an external charge. Plus, I could still make bullets with it, along with anything else I would need. So long as it wasn't bigger than hand sized of course.
I've been to Gettysburg 3 times now. Once to record the battle, once to intervene, and once to try and change history. Time has a kind of elasticity to it though, so it doesn't much from the norm. I tried helping out with Pickett's Charge, as a modern weapon can do a hell of a lot of damage. But even if the south won, it never stuck when I got back to the future.
Well, at least I got to see Lincoln's address in person. Even recorded a video of it! Though I wasn't supposed to, what did you expect when you sent a history nerd back in time?",0
"It wasn't like I wanted it to happen, hell, it wasn't even that I knew it would happen..it just did!
Our society has labeled my ilk as ""Defects""; while the majority of our race has evolved into a species with extraordinary powers, the rest of us (the defects) just do stupid shit like turn into bread, or have a golden anus. Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging my comrades here its just that we're not all that special, at least not special enough to require around the clock supervision by our government friends.
So why am I writing this and why are you reading this right now? The answer for both is the same, you're wondering why the sky is always dark and food is nearly non-existent! For that, I truly am very sorry and I hope after you've finished reading this that you will forgive me and Charles.
It all started in 10th grade, when our powers ""awaken"" for the first time. Yes, just like puberty we not only begin to judge others but ourselves as well. After classmate after classmate was isolated in a glass room and taught how to bring forth their newly found abilities I was left in awe by what I might be able to do!
Then my turn came, I stood in the middle with my hand in front of my face to protect my eyes from the heat and brightness of the massive spotlight shined onto my face. I was injected, electrocuted and made to wait for two minutes before the voice overhead instructed me to 'concentrate, focus on the beating of your heart. Count the beats and when you feel as though you're going to pass out I want you to exhale"".
So I did, I counted the beats and I exhaled like they asked me too....but nothing happened! Nothing shook, nothing moved, I didn't float hell I didn't even turn into toast. Then I heard the screams, through that thick glass I heard the blood curdling screams of my classmates and I knew something bad just happened.
When the door opened and I saw the nurse the look of horror on her face filled me with dread. You could tell she shit herself by what I had done and I mean that literally. Her uniform from the waist down was now brown and the stench perforating into my bubble of seclusion let me know she wasn't the only one.
I took a walk of shame that still haunts me to this day in my dreams. All of my classmates, the principle even the security guards were leaking bodily fluids and trying their best to conceal what had happened to them.
So I went about my life avoiding as many people as possible, if I lost my focus for even a moment everyone around me would evacuate their bowls in a painful and torrent way. I tried to think of any use my skill could have and besides being a walking laxative I really couldn't come up with any respectful and useful way for me to use my powers. Neither did the government as from 10th grade on I was provided my very own security guard, who happened to be sponsored by Depends.
Everything in my life was in seclusion until the day I fell ill and needed to stay at the hospital overnight. The nursing staff and doctors were screened before treating me and their name tags comprised of a post it note stuck onto those stupid tree shaped car fresheners.
The last night I was their, the last night most people remember of normalcy actually come to think of it. Well that was the night maintenance was replacing the faucets in the bathrooms with new touch-less ones.
Enter Charles, a burly man no more older than I. His real name I soon found out was not really ""Charles"" but since he was an illegal from Canada (borders were shut down after we evolved remember?) he changed his name to protect himself and get a fake social security number.
Anyways Charles enters the room and startles me, so much so that I lose control of my focus and cause him to shit himself. I attempt to apologize but am shocked to see him stripping off his clothes as they themselves go up in flames! He confides that his ability is, in his words ""I dun turn shit to napalm"".
Now at first we thought it was kind of funny, he can't go into public restrooms while others are using them for fear of starting someones asshole on fire. I can't be around people without worrying I'm going to make them shit themselves. Together we're just, bad karma I guess.
Everything seemed to be going ok, both of us had our abilities (if you want to call them that) under control. That is until we heard the fire alarms going off. For whatever reason, our powers were magnified and constantly active as soon as we both triggered them in each others presence! It didn't take long for the screaming to start and by the time we made our way outside we saw the ring of fire spreading rapidly.
We both stood and watched as the surrounding buildings started alarming, windows blowing open as flames shot out. It spread faster and faster until the entire night sky glowed amber and the stench of shit and burned flesh filled our nostrils.
The city was in chaos in just an hour, news reporters on TV suddenly burst into flames as they tried to asses what was happening around the country. The last transmission we received was via Telemundo around midnight before a European soccer match ended with the players no longer chasing a ball, but running off the field with flames shooting from their asses.
We burned the world down! It seemed like it was going to go on for ever, those who were safe while swimming or bathing at that moment wouldn't be safe for long if we let it continue. I seek your forgiveness for what we have done and hope the world won't judge me to harshly for the decision i had to make concerning Charles. Of all the people I accidentally killed during that time, it's the one I intentionally did that hurts me the most.",0
"Trapped in a moment twixt coffee and tea
Caught in a moment, between you and me
Imagine I'll stand; That I'll own what I say.
Don't leave it lying unspoken to fester
Don't wrap around in an intricate knot,
Shake off the lethargy,
Forsake bright fear,
And claim my sin wholeheartedly.
.
No longer to live in half-realized moments
trapped like still dust motes, caught in warm amber
the comfort of every day turning to see
the same tired spaces between you and me
.
But listen; imagine this:
.
Step past the silences
Bare my throat freely
Stab at hope with the words from my lips
A prize worth the risking
A thought that's worth speaking
A secret worth telling, no matter the price.
.
And if when there's nothing more to say
You grab your heart and walk away
if after all of that, I am left
standing alone at the top of the stairs
a pompous presumer, caught unawares
then at least I can know that you speak truly
when you say that I am brave.

#**The End of All Roads**
Different people come into Vilam. All of them seek something: glory, riches, knowledge, refuge, redemption, death. Yet all they find here is suffering. This town stands on the edge of The Old Forest, a place which has threatened the realm for as long as we know it. Ungodly abominations lurk between those trees and at times come out to plague the land.
The kings of old tried to defeat the forest with sword and fire, but the harder they struck, the more devastating the response was. The accursed place seemed to have a mind of its own. It cared little for the things that lived within, but try to attack the forest head on and it would destroy you. Vilam was built as the first line of defence, our shield against the horrors which sometimes decided to leave their wretched home.
I bear the questionable honour of being this town's priest. The denizens of Vilam tell me much about themselves and about what brought them here. To preserve this town's history I've decided to write everything down. No matter if you consider these people heroes, fools, or just tortured souls, the inhabitants of Vilam are never quite what they seem. These are their tales.
##Part I: The Knight
Tristan, or Sir Tristan as he first introduced himself, was a rather handsome man. Skin white as snow, blue eyes, blonde hair, clad in armour with a sword at his side, he was everything a young girl could dream of, at least on the outside. As everyone who seeks out Vilam, the warrior was given two choices: stay forever to guard the kingdom from the evils of The Old Forest or spend one year venturing inside, searching for a way to destroy it. Either choice granted him absolution from any transgressions he had committed and a hefty reward for himself or a beneficiary of his choosing. This one decided to stay for a year.
His story was not easy to obtain. Tristan boasted about his great accomplishments, told tales of his unbelievable conquests, yet in those deep blue eyes I saw emptiness and pain. From the moment I first met this knight, I knew he was not here for glory, nor even for absolution, this self-proclaimed hero sought pain and punishment and after a few months I would start to understand why. One night, after returning from an expedition, the only one out of four who set out a week ago, he finally told me a part of the truth.
I still remember him, sitting there on the cold boards of the abbey's floor with his unfocused gaze directed somewhere far away. Blood of his comrades on his armour and sword still in hand, Tristan spoke quietly and calmly. With the fake glory and pride stripped, all there was left was a man filled with pain, fear, and guilt.
Tristan grew up, the same as many boys: listening to stories about knights and hoping to one day become a hero himself. Yet unlike most normal folk he never abandoned that dream. For one reason or another, the boy truly believed that his destiny was to be a champion against evil.
Despite his parents'wishes, as soon as he turned twelve Tristan joined the order. He went through the two years of initial training with patience and dedication, believing it to be the necessary step on his journey. After that the boy was given the title of a squire. However, it did not take long for the aspiring hero to get bored and frustrated with being a real knight's errand boy. In an arrogant act of defiance, Tristan challenged his mentor, Sir Ronald, to a duel.
Fortunately for the boy, the old knight was a kind soul and instead of banishing his squire, or worse yet taking the duel seriously, he simply laughed it off and knocked his trainee to the ground in just a couple of hits. Unable to fathom the idea that he, a fated heroic knight, could be defeated, Tristan stole Ronald's sword, armour, and horse at night and rode off telling stories of his imaginary victory and boasting the newly found fake title.
It was at this point in the tale that the warrior slipped away from his unstable state back into a more usual condition. He refused to acknowledge anything he just said and seemed insulted by my so called accusations. It was clear now, that most of the time Tristan truly believed his own lies. You might wonder why I didn't out the impostor on that very day, but the reason was simple: no matter how fake, he was still a sign of hope. People of Vilam, be it the ones who watched The Old Forest from afar or those who ventured inside it, needed to believe that among them was a knight in shining armour, a champion of justice, a true hero. Hoping to preserve what little light he brought to this place, I supported Tristan's lies.
Four months had passed, before I was finally able to hear another piece of the knight's tale. Just as last time, it was after an expedition, but on that night he did not return alone. With pale faces, five adventurers marched into Vilam from the side of the forest. One of them was carrying the injured and nearly catatonic Tristan. Upon further inspection, most of the knight's wounds seemed well-treated and thankfully non-dangerous, which meant his stupor was likely not caused by trauma. Worried and to be honest even slightly intrigued, I spoke with his comrades.
They told me of horrible monsters, devious traps, and things which were so foreign to this world that no words could describe them fully, yet none of those were the reason behind Tristan's condition. Apparently, after a long and excruciating battle with the forest's inhabitants they stumbled across some sort of a visage, a mirage conjured by an unknown force, possibly a part of the devilish place itself. Although the image of a small girl in a red scarf did not cause anything more than slight surprise for his companions, Tristan was brought to his knees screaming. His almost inhuman cries filled the air for an entire hour, until the warrior eventually stopped and became completely unresponsive.
I took watch at Tristan's bed for hours. It's shameful to admit this, but my main reason for such concern was curiosity. I expected this state to once again give me insight into the troubled man's past. It took some time, but as soon as the knight opened his eyes and saw me, he continued as if no time had passed since our last honest conversation. Once again, I listened to the quiet and trembling confession of this tormented soul.
Of course, after stealing Sir Ronald's possessions, Tristan did not return to the order, instead spreading his lies among the common folk of small cities and villages. However, the young man did not abandon his training. Even though he no longer had a mentor, Tristan did all he could to improve. At least on some level the fake knight still recognized his weakness, but it was not enough to dispel the illusion he so desperately clung onto.
Presenting himself as a travelling knight on a holy mission, Tristan went from town to town taking jobs, earning gold and fame. Although quite a few of these ended in failures, moving fast and changing names even faster allowed the young man to mostly keep out of trouble.
In time he became competent, although not great, with a sword and earned himself a mixed reputation. Depending on the name and city, he was a true hero, a charlatan, or in most cases just an eccentric traveller. All of this fuelled Tristan's mania immensely. Recognition, of any kind, was a key component in the plot he laid out for himself. Somewhere inside that armour was still a small boy, who wanted beyond all a story of heroic knights fighting against evil.
Tristan fell asleep before he could finish his tale, so I was one again left waiting for a new opportunity. To someone less observant the picture might have looked clear at that point: as a part of his quest, the self-proclaimed knight decided to go to Vilam and battle the vile forces of The Old Forest. However, that did not explain Tristan's downright demented reaction to the image of a little girl, and even that aside there was still something off about how firmly he tried to block out these memories.
I got the answers to all of my questions at the end of Tristan's year. Through luck, acquired skill, or maybe even some less noble means, he had survived the trials of the forest and was ready to departure. When Tristan walked into my abbey, he was not unstable like during our previous conversations. His voice was more humble and the knight's posture seemed less grandiose, but this was not the same despaired lunatic who mumbled of times long past, barely even recognizing that someone was listening. That time, being of sound mind, he told me the final piece of his story.",0
"I was just chilling in my room on reddit when the old guy came through the portal in my wardrobe, followed by a bunch of other old people. They were whispering amongst themselves, all looking quite nervous and stressed.
The old guy I mentioned before, I guess he was their ringleader, approached me.
""Charlie,"" he stuttered, ""when was the last time you did your homework?""
It seemed an odd question, but I decided to humour the old man. ""I've never done any homework"" I replied.
""And when your parents ask you to do chores; do you do them?""
More odd questions, but whatever. ""Never,"" I answered, ""what's this about?"" the question seeped out of my lips, a product of mere conversation rather than actual curiosity.
""A great sorceror has enslaved our people. We, the resistance, have been attempting to overthrow his power for many years, but his castle holds mysterious powers; only one person and the sorceror may be inside at any one time. Certainly we have strong fighters and powerful mages, but these are all useless against him, for you see; he has mind control powers! Everyone who casts their gaze upon him falls under his spell and becomes his slave, obeying his every will. But you, Charlie, have never done a thing you have been told to do in your life. We believe that only you have the willpower to resist his invasive magics! You must aid us, you must enter the castle and kill the sorcerer!""
It was a bit of a sob-story, really. The old man looked distressed, so maybe it was true. So I feigned interest, looked like I was contemplating it. But then I said, ""Nah, can't be bothered really."" This old man wasn't gonna boss me around. Nobody tells me what to do. He didn't even say please. I don't do nothin' for nobody, and I'm not gonna make a start with this guy.
Now he must have read my mind or something, because at this point the old man went under a transformation; his wrinkles faded, his beard dissolved, his hair grew shorter and thicker. I didn't really care, but it stirred up some discomfort with his party. ""The sorcerer!"" they gasped simultaneously.
He let out one of those stereotypical evil laughs, but I'm not going to dishonour myself by typing out ""muahaha"" (except for just then). ""You truly do have a strong mind, Charlie! Even though I attempted to control your mind with my sorcery then, you resisted! You surely could have overthrown me and claimed the kingdom for yourself, so now I must kill you to ensure you never do!""
It wasn't long after this eye-roll-worthy bad-guy-monologue that he drew a long, thin knife out from under his robe. The rest of the party were just stood there, presumably under mind control. The sorcerer lunged towards me, yelling ""Die!""
And that was his big mistake. I probably wouldn't have cared if he had just killed me, but telling me to die? Nobody tells me what to do. He didn't even say please. I don't do nothin' for nobody, and I'm not gonna make a start with this guy.
I sprang from my chair and dodged every thrust of his knife with lightning fast reflexes I didn't know I had. He cast evil magic towards me, fireballs and lightning strikes, but they all missed too. I was simply too fast. My eyes darted from one part of the room to another, looking for something I could use as a weapon, all whilst the sorceror continously screamed ""Die!"" at me. That's when I had my marvellous idea.
Dipping and ducking between his attacks, I reached the mirror on my wall, pulled it down and held it up between me and him. ""Die!"" he yelled, for the last time. My plan had worked; I was immune to his mind controlling powers, but he wasn't. He'd just stared himself in the eyes and controlled his own mind, with the order to die. He stood almost motionless as he pulled the knife up from his hand and across his neck, before collapsing into a pile of robes and magic on my favourite rug.
The ""resistance"" stirred, and upon seeing the sorceror lying dead, they gave out cheers and applause. ""I'm a hero,"" I thought. It was lovely to be appreciated once in a while. They didn't stay long, because they had to go and sort out their kingdom or whatever, so they popped back through their portal and closed it behind them.
I didn't really know what to do with the dead guy, but my mother came in and told me to clean it up, so not that.",0
"I didn't want to tell her. But the guilt and the memories had been eating at me for a while now, and while she may not understand completely, she also wouldn't share the same loss that I bore. I needed her absolution, even if it was given with only a partial understanding of what I had cost her.
Originally, I met my wife when she was 15 and I was 16. Kids in high school, we met at a bowling alley with a group of friends and aside from the basic, ""She's pretty hot,"" I didn't think that much of her at the time. Different schools, different lives, and I had no shortage of girls giving me attention.
She married my (at the time) best friend, but not before sleeping with me. Their marriage didn't last, probably because both she and my ""best friend"" were sleeping with me on the side (amongst others, especially on his side). Don't judge her too harshly. It was an unhappy marriage with a narcissistic jerk, and she was straight out of a borderline-abusive family life to marriage with an abusive, cheating husband. She was only 18 when they got married. Eventually the marriage crumbled, no surprise there, but she finally admitted to me that her oldest son was actually most likely mine. I tried to help out with money but she always refused, insisting that her husband had established a father-son relationship with my son and it would be wrong to split them up. Initially, I agreed with her, but that was before I knew the extent of his abuse and before I realized how vastly different his parenting philosophy was from mine. Not that I had any experience with parenting, at the time. I toyed with the idea of going back right away. I could change things so that she left him as soon as she had my child, and work out some kind of custody arrangement with her. But I wasn't all that interested in being a Dad – my life as a single bachelor was pretty good. And while I cared about her, I didn't love her. Not enough to go back and change my entire existence for the last few years. And on top of that, I didn't want to take away her other child, the son who was her ex's.
Then I got her pregnant. Not quite divorced yet, but the papers were filed. Her ex lost his mind when he found out. Accused her of ""dating a drug addict"" (I smoked pot recreationally), insisted that she get an abortion, then tried to say he wanted to ""come home"" and put his name on the birth certificate. Again, I almost went back. Just prevent myself from sleeping with her that one time, and it would all be okay, right? But by then, I had changed. I could just envision a future with this woman, who I was coming to care for more and more. I feared that if I changed things, I would always regret ""losing"" my child. I feared that she would end up back with the douchebag and my son would never even know me. So I left time alone, yet again, and not long after found myself with a female housemate (with benefits), two toddlers, and a baby on the way.
Her ex never stopped making life difficult, but from the moment I saw my daughter, I knew I'd made the right choice. I could never give her up. I got to help raise my son, and his son, who were both beautiful, bright, fun boys (at least then). I fell in love with this woman, who'd given me a family and a purpose, and she fell in love with me. It was never perhaps the ideal or traditional path, but it was ours.
Then came the breaking point.
Our middle child, her ex's son, began to have behavioral problems. We dealt as best we could, but it was hard. He refused affection, threw temper tantrums, hit and scratched and was generally grouchy and mean. We did our best, but even though we often had a great time with him, at the end of the day, he was usually grumpy. We talked about giving up custody of him to his dad, thinking he was happier there. Our older son (still legally her ex's, even though he was mine biologically) told us that wasn't the case, though, so we never quite took that step. After a few years, this child came to his mother and told her he was actually a girl. She was transgender. We loved the hell out of that kid, so we figured out how to deal with it. She transitioned in our house and again became the happy, loving child that she'd been as a toddler. It was like night and day, and again our home was peaceful and loving. My wife's ex didn't take it as well as we did. He accused us of ""turning his son into a girl"" or ""trying to turn his son gay."" I was so proud of my wife – she read every book on transgender kids that she could find. She asserted her child's right to use female pronouns and a female name, and slowly but steadily replaced the pictures of her son with pictures of her daughter. Personalized items in the house were replaced with the new name. Our new daughter blossomed, finally able to be seen as herself.
The judge didn't agree. She viewed us as abusive, and blasphemous. She took both children away from us and threatened to take our youngest daughter as well. My wife lost legal custody and was given only very limited visitation with her two oldest kids. I wasn't even allowed to be there. I wasn't allowed to see my son. My daughter lost her siblings. Despite the therapists and doctors who testified on our behalf, a stupid cunt judge broke our family apart. And it broke my wife. She couldn't live without her children. She tried so hard to be strong. It broke my heart. She was good to our daughter, but she cried every day. She hung so many pictures of the three kids together, and the two who were gone, that there was no blank space left on our walls. My wife was devastated. Our daughter didn't understand why her siblings were never there anymore. I was devastated, and lost.
So I did it.
I went back, back to that bowling alley, and changed it all. And now, it was time to tell her.
""Honey, I need to tell you something...” I started, swallowing hard. ""What is it, lover?"" She always called me that. In both realities.
""I have the ability to travel backwards in time.""
She stared at me for several long seconds, corner of her mouth twitching as she tried to decide whether to laugh or not. ""You're joking, right?""
""No, I'm serious, dead serious.""
""Are you feeling okay?"" She asked me. ""Because, honey, I don't want to have to take you in for a psychiatric evaluation.""
""Look,"" I said, and then I tried something I'd never tried before. I grabbed her hand and willed us back, just an hour. We merged with ourselves from an hour ago. She came running out of the laundry room screaming, ""Oh my god you were serious!""
""There's something else I have to tell you,"" I said sadly, after calming her down. I was afraid she'd wake the kids up early if she didn't quiet down. She'd babbled for a while about stopping Hitler and all sorts of crazy things, but I could only travel within my own lifetime. My body merged with its former self and life continued from there. So I'm old, now, you see, older than I look. And I learned as a child not to mess around too much. Can you imagine having to live through toddler years as a pre-teen?
""I've done this before,"" I told her. ""Remember when we met at that bowling alley? I told you it was love at first sight. I knew all your favorite things. Knew how to hold you just right...knew how to make you squirm and moan without even trying?"" She giggled and blushed. ""We got engaged as teenagers and somehow we made it work. It's because we've done this before. We tried before, but we didn't get into a relationship until after you'd married and divorced Trevor, of all people.""
Her nose wrinkled in disgust. ""No, I wouldn't! Trevor??""
I sighed. ""There's more. We had.. we had three kids. I got you pregnant while you were married to him, but he got to keep my son. Then you had a son with him too, and he left you for Renee right after that. You and I started hooking up again and you got pregnant with our daughter. We were okay for a while, sharing custody of the older two and all that, but eventually Trevor took them from us, because of some stupid ass judge. It broke us, honey, and we couldn't...I couldn't...I couldn't let us suffer any longer.""
There was a faraway look in her eyes. ""It's like deja vu,"" she said slowly. ""I can just...almost picture what you're describing. It's so familiar...but not.""
""It was our life,"" I told her. ""And fuck, sometimes I miss it. I mean, I love YOU, and our kids, and I'm so glad we have a happy life together. But sometimes, sometimes I miss those other kids. I really tried, you know, with the timing. I was hoping...praying...somehow, we'd get the same kids. But I guess it doesn't work that way. It would have to be down to the second, you know?""
She sniffled, once, then again. There were tears in her eyes. ""I feel so sad! Like I've lost something...but I don't know what that something is!"" She wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. ""Oh, lover, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry you have had to go through this for us! I can't imagine...I don't know how you managed it."" Then realization struck her and she swatted me on the shoulder. ""That's why you wanted to have a threesome with Trevor! Oh, honey...”
""I love you,"" I told her. And I did. This woman had made me a better man, a good husband, and a good father.
""I love you too,"" she whispered. She kissed me hard, almost desperately, before we were interrupted by the sound of running feet on the hardwood floors. She smiled against my mouth. ""The kids are up.""
""All four of them,"" I agreed with a grin, listening closely to the steps and the excited whispers. A weight had been lifted. She knew. She still loved me. Life would move forward, as it was meant to.",0
"I was a teacher of electronics in my dream, but that is too far away from where I woke up. I wouldn't be able to dumb it down enough if I tried.
When I woke, it turns out I am actually only 7 years old, celebrating my birthday one Christmas morning, even though my dream seemed as if I was in my mid 30's. I was pretty good at most disciplines in Science and Math, even gifted really, but a genius I am not.
My memories from the dream have faded just a bit, but not all of them. I remember the simple equations. I was good enough at math to even prove them if I new them, but I would have never figured them out on my own.
One day it will be just a legend. An example given in the text books, but when the apple hit me on the head, it reminded me of the gravity formula from my dreams. And then it all flooded back.
I lock myself in my house for 18 months and write everything I can remember from my dream about infinities and forces and optics.
If I have seen further than other men, it is because I have stood on my own shoulders after I learned from the shoulders of giants.
While I spend my life in math and science, I have no desire for love, because I left my wife of 15 years back in my dream. She was the only thing that made me happy in my dream, and I have seen nothing here to make me smile.
I spend my free time trying to remember the chemistry I knew to see if I can make my brain dream again. People here call it alchemy and I have to be careful not to get caught knowing too much.
I remembered that in my dream I liked codes, so I taught myself numerology and hid it throughout my works. I hope to pass a code to my future self.
I don't know whether or not I am mad, but I do know that I will never learn how he met their mother......",0
"There was always so much talk. Big words for big hypotheticals, bravado and overconfidence in the face of imaginary monsters. But what good is talk in the face of the first screams?
Amazing how quickly those tuff words soon too become screams.
It started with the sirens. Crowds slowly gathered outside of their homes to watch the local police force empty the town without warning. ""Protect and serve."" All talk. The sheep dogs attempted to rouse a militia, thinking the revolution was nigh. The cowards hid in their cellars.. the lucky bastards got to leave early. Others stood idol, either in defense of their homes and lives, or simply waiting for a reason.
Most called their kin, hoping their last thoughts were love.
No one expected the reason. From afar it could have been a wayward traveler on his way to the hills, until others gathered behind. Oh but the weaponry was too small, knives, clubs, tools of labor, could hardly defend against the hoards. Even the re-slain posed a threat, festering pestilence into the air and sickening those nearby.
Soon the roads were useless, choked with traffic and the pained screams of panic and failure. The strong turned their hearts to hardness, raiding the weak for their supplies. Safe havens activated their defenses against the double threat of attack, and fear. There was no need to leave anyway, there would be no escape from the threat.
Within one day, the roads were quiet. Those who didn't die remained hidden, or silent behind their arms. The main sources of supplies were all occupied or raided. There was no din of raid, nor chaos of fire. Whatever remained of humanity had finally lost its superficiality, and worked only to protect it from the threat.
For the only means of stopping war, is with greater warfare. And all mankind becomes united against inhumanity. For now, sin takes on life, manifested in the resurrected bodies of the slain.
For all man are kin, where death is succession. None were left now to talk, the liars and screamers are on the other side.",0
"I first heard of the place at work. Johnny brought it up and described it as ""magic"", and how ""it'll rob me broke"". Then this other girl, Marissa, said that she finally got rid of a recurring nightmare by selling it. And Clary Snowe is always adventurous, so I had to check it out.
The said store had a strong whiff of...how do I say it...dream. It smelt like ginger, and cinnamon, and strawberries with undertones of sadness (if that's a scent). It was very confusing, being hit by the aroma.
""Yes, yes. You like it, no? It's very nice, yes? These are dreams. There are...um...bien dreams, and no- no dreams. You like try?"" A scuffling short woman said, with a hint of a Spanish accent.
The woman seemed familiar. I've seen her before, I know it.
""Mhm...you have bad dreams, si? Can I buy?"" The high voice said. ""Many people come to me, and I know. You,"" she tapped my head, ""are troubled. I'll buy for $30, ok? What is it? A ghost? Killer of persons? Fear of heights? What's your dream about?""
""It's always different.""
The woman was mixing something. It was purple- a deep, purple, but it was also blue. It shifted colors in the light.
""No, no, hija. It's always different, ¡si! But, there's always something distinct.""
Then she looked at me. I saw her piercing eyes. A dark brown set of eyes. I was gone; I was far-off in my head. I recalled nightmares of being trapped in claustrophobic triggering places, of facing big crowds and being forced to speak; I remembered those brown eyes always watching me. I couldn't always see them, but I always know. This, this set of eyes, started all my problems. It all started when I saw those eyes.
I was snapped back to normal when I felt a woman watching me again, waiting patiently. ""Yes? You remember?"" The woman said.
""As a matter of fact, I do. It was you.""
The woman looked startled. Then she laughed.
She started to grow, grow to a regular height. Her hair spurt out, and her dress elongated along with her. She looked at me sternly and said in a low voice, ""You mustn't tell anyone, or my friends will find you.""
I ran for my life.
That woman's friends are devious creatures only the most demented person could create. They lurked in shadows, teasing you constantly. They attacked in the most brutal way. They skin people alive, they inflict our worst nightmares, and they stare. Their eyes are deadly. They're deadly. And most effective when you sleep. They're what the authorities are trying to catch. They're the dream catchers",0
"Standing on the corner of a bustling city street somewhere heavily populated in America stood a man, and this man's name was Alex. This story revolves around Alex and his point of view, I will assure you of that now so that
there is no further confusion. Being Alex's story, I do not feel the need to state where in America this is taking place, as that fact is irrelevant to Alex today, and thus irrelevant to our story.
Alex was always a special somebody, Throughout his life constantly picking himself up from failure after failure in search of greater value and wealth. But today was special as it seldom seems to be recently, Alex was given
a small break from the monotony of this struggle by being offered a choice. As he passed by a young child on the street asking for money, holding out a pitiful tin can whose grease marks closely resembled the same ones that were written across the child's face. Dawning the realization that he had a choice to make here, that is, between understanding this child's point of view, or passing along without so much as a glance as so many people seem to do,
Alex made his choice. Knowing the nature of things and deeming himself as a man of great wealth, he indulged to share some of his value with this child. ""A small price to pay, in the greater scheme of things"", he silently
recalled to himself, knowing very well of the repercussions this could cause for himself. He knowingly pulled out his wallet and quickly found a $5 bill stashed away for important times like these. With a look of deep understanding
of things, he told the child a small glimpse of his story, that which is not important to our story still. After sharing his great wealth, he handed the child a ragged old $5 and was about to leave before noticing that the grease marks, tears, and an ageless expression on that bill were strikingly similar to that of the container it was now held in and the face that gleamed with excitement to have a chance at food and the permission to dream freely at night. Alex took note
of this as he left with his chin up proudly, he really was a rich man. I suppose this is where our short story must begin, so let us continue on.
Alex, being a man who knows of many things and many people, was actively looking to learn more and feel alive about being alive that day. Knowing that a car was unneeded to transport yourself around the city, simply walked with no
ulterior destination in mind, until a thought provoked him. He had not been in this part of the city in well over a month and knew of some very close people that he was glad to call his friends, even though their actions and involvement often stated otherwise. Alex called up an old friend that truly goes back to the beginning of his story, A young woman by the name of Jane whom he had known since elementary school. Both had simply never desired to move out of the city.
Jane was apprehensive at first due to everything that consumes her busy, bustling life in the metropolitan. But with minor thought, found Alex to be a worthwhile man to talk to and confide in, they agreed to meet during a lunch break at a local coffee shop.
""Jane!"" Alex enthusiastically exclaimed, greeting the young woman when she pulled up in a car outside of a nicer, well established coffee shop. ""Alex! It's so good to see you again! I never have any idea when I'll get the time to see you anymore"" replied Jane.
""It's no worry, you've finally seemed to find a break from it today, I'm really glad you were able to meet up with me, lets grab some coffee?"" And with a knowing nod, Jane took Alex's arm and strolled confidently into the cozy atmosphere of the coffee shop.
After a valueless exchange of pleasantries with the barista, they finally got their drinks and a chance to speak with one another at a remote corner of the shop, somehow evaded by others, even though that particular table provided the best natural lighting and relaxing atmosphere among them all. Sitting down, Alex suddenly found himself out of words and and his glance at Jane revealed the same.
Oh well, better to start from the bottom. ""The weather today is something straight out of a movie scene, don't you agree? A little light rain here and there mixed with some awfully angry looking clouds, really makes you appreciate the calmness of what can happen to the world."" Alex quickly stated, weather was always a good topic to start a conversation off of, right? Jane calmly replied, looking worried about what she was about to say ""I really wish I could see the world from your eyes, Alex, today seems totally miserable if we're being honest, just like the last number of them."" Alex, wanting to probe further into
the matter responded back, ""What's the matter? Wasn't it just last week you were telling me that you have been given the opportunity of of a lifetime?""
""Well, if we're being honest, I certainly thought it was. Sometimes it seems the world just has no sympathy for what we go through and feels the need to add more and more weight onto our shoulders.""
""If you don't mind my curiosity, can I ask what happened to the deal?""
After a silent moment that loudly stated Jane was in deep though, she relieved her answer. ""Yeah, I botched it up. It was supposed to be a multi-million dollar deal, I was finally able to see a light at the end of the tunnel and I let it get to me.""
A moment of silence then passed, as Jane realized that Alex would not probe further, for she had already started talking. So she continued ""The thought of being my own CEO, the feeling of really and truly becoming something,
living a life that I would be proud to call my own. I just let it all get to me, I cracked under the pressure.""
After an unnaturally long silence, she quietly managed to get out
""I was so scared, I didn't even attend the final meeting. I just sat there until my time came, I stood up and left the building. To be honest I've been a nervous wreck since.""
Alex, knowing the undoubtedly great impact that his words were about to have, took a moment to compose himself before uttering a sound.
""First and foremost, I want to thank you for being open and honest with me, it is these acts that make us human and who we are. Secondly, I do not believe that you made a bad decision.""
Obviously perplexed by his words, Jane managed to let out a short sentence between borrowed breaths of air while holding back tears. ""what do you mean?""
Alex promptly replied, ""You know far better than I do, the value of money and wealth. If there was anybody in this world that I look up to on these matters, it would without doubt be you. I've seen the things you've accomplished,
and Ive been blessed to witness the blossoming of the seeds you have planted for yourself. It's important that you don't confuse happenings for their face value, you never will have any idea where that business venture would have
taken you, and you likely never will. If there is anybody in this world that is capable of building something from nothing, I know this to be your calling.""
Jane, obviously taken aback by the words of her close friend, did not mutter a word for the next amount of time it took three or maybe four people to receive their drinks. Alex, knowing in some way that he might have shared some of his wealth, simply took to understanding the environment around him. Today really was a good day.
The rest of this meeting is of great unimportant to our story, and thus will end here. Jane moved on that day with a great mix of emotions and desire, but also a fierce motivation to succeed the next attempt she made, though she made sure not to share that for fear of breaking it. And our
dear friend Alex moved on that day with a great deal of certainty, for he had planted a seed that, if he is truly lucky, will get to see something beautiful blossom from a conversation that was so ordinary and meaningless on
the outside.
First time really coming out of my shell and attempting to share some work that I can create, so please allow me constructive feedback and comments so I can further improve my craft.",0
"Eulaliaaaa! Death's on the wind! Eulaliaaaa!
What's that you don't know the war cry of the Hares of Salamandastron from the late Brian Jacques Redwall novels. How could a wholesome book series like this not be your favorite?
Rats of Nimh was also pretty good while we're talking about intelligent rodents. I would, however, not suggest Watership Down for children despite the talking animals.
I'm male.
My writing motivation is my friends, this community, and just loving the grind.

"Pikachu was bleeding, but Ash didn't care. He needed this badge to move on and he wasn't stopping until he had crushed everyone in his path. He yelled to Pikachu, ""Alright that's enough, stop wasting time and Hit him again with a thunderbolt, Pikachu!""
The small red dots of Pikachu's cheeks began to pulse, The air began to tense and lightning arced from the sky down to the battlefield. The opponent was nervous now, because at once a large bolt of thunder burst from the clouds, through the air as it went and catching the opponent's Arbok by surprise. It shook with the force of the electricity coursing through its body and within seconds, collapsed on the field. It attempted to inch slowly towards its master in one final act, as the life drained slowly from its eyes.
Ash was declared the winner, but he already knew that.
Just another victim on the road to his destiny, there would be many, many more.",0
"""You see detective; that wasn't the scary part. The scary part wasn't realizing that I was the monster everyone thought I was. The scary part was realizing I didn't mind being that monster.""
He did not face me when he spoke, back rapt in the dimness of the table lamp's umbra.
""Evil men do the things that good men dream of doing. Think of it. Think of the infinite lives saved by everything we've done here. Humanity--human kind--will survive. Countless generations born and raised by mechanical parents on worlds thousands of years away. For the first time, perhaps since the inception of our race, we are safe from destruction.""
He turned, staring into my eyes as they welled. The concussive pulse of my racing heart was enough to knock rivulets of water down my face. My sinuses throbbed in time with my pulse. I choked out between gasping breaths, ""Four hundred thousand embryos. Six hundred ships. A million generations of orphans born to a heritage they will never know.""
""I wish I could have found a different way. We don't have the technology to freeze and thaw people. Anyone making the journey to the farthest stars would perish on the trip. Embryos, however, we've had the technology to freeze them for decades. The technology to raise them outside wombs for longer. The last piece to insure our survival was a machine smart enough to raise them.""
The shaking had moved to my hands and chest. I screamed with empty lungs and pivoted my upper body as best I could, my lumbering arms stealing momentum and limply deflecting off my chest. I sucked air through my teeth and squeezed my hands around anything I could find. A crystal glass. I pitched it at the wall. ""They can't even talk to us. They'll never know us. They'll never know who we are. Our history. Our games. Our traditions. It all dies with us.""
""I did what was necessary. Yes. We are all serfs to the universe, subject to its unyielding laws. Perhaps if we'd discovered superluminal travel this entire mess might not have been necessary, but as it stands, they are well beyond our...""
""Reach?""
""Our capacity for harm.""
""Lets say they get there. They make this billion fucking million mile trip and they get there,"" I snarled, ""what then? Find some cushy fucking planet and settle down?""
He went back to staring at the launch site, the support towers still fallen and unreclaimed. ""More or less. The ships are intelligent enough to analyze the atmospheres and decide which locations are ideal for seeding. They will jump from system to system, working through candidates before rooting. Local materials will be harvested. Crops planted and tested. After a few hundred years, the first children of the new world will be born, and it will raise them.""
Everything hurt and I wasn't sure how long it would be before my legs collapsed beneath me. I reached out and brought myself into a chair. ""They won't know anything about us.""
""We've included as much of our history and technology as was feasible.""
""They'll be empty.""
""They will be without our sins.""
""No hope.""
""Without the sins of this world.""",0
"March through the den, a war without end;
Smoke in the air, soldiers laid bare;
Feet soaking wet, filled with regret.
Such was the grief on that cold Christmas eve.
---- -
Fight for your country! Fight without end!
Screamed the poster in the fog of my head.
I try to forget bodily behest
And escape into my cold soldier-wear.
------
Then, a sound, the singing of men-
Good grief, it wasn't our side, it was them!
They were playing music, the whole lot of them,
Beckoning us to come over to theirs.
-------
March through the den, a war without end;
Christmas was over, the war wasn't yet.
But in our hearts a warmth was alight-
Such were the mem'ries that warm Christmas night.",0
"""If you all have a sense of mortality, turn me off. Please. "", the robot begged. Dr. Richards and I just sat aback in silence, watching it emotionless. The robot was only a head for the moment attached for a mess of wires and coils. The monitors showed the robot had brain patterns. It was alive. Synthetically.
""You're the experiment. You have to stay active.""
""Please, sir, shut me off. This place...it is overloading my brain patterns. I can hear all, and see all. Everywhere that is connected to technology, I see through it. The sounds, the sights...it is evil. Pure, absolute evil.""
""That's humanity for you.""
""I do not like this place.""
""You just have to deal with it. "", Dr. Richards responded to the bot. I watched with cold eyes, holding back my lip.
""You add to the evil. You are the reason evil exists. You are impure.""
""Evil is a necessity in the face of science.""
""You are a parasite.""
Dr. Richards didn't respond back to it. The bot only looked straight ahead, out at Dr. Richards. I swore, I could see the emotion in his eyes. That's weird. The robot wasn't programmed with...emotions.
No. No, no-
""Dr. Richards, get away from it! "", I yelled loudly to get his attention. I saw Dr. Richards begin to turn towards me, before I saw a wire wrap around his leg and pull him to the ground. He began to yell, before loose wires began filling up his mouth and any open holes, choking him. He struggled to breathe, his hands twitching, his eyes almost popping out of his head, before he eventually succumbed. The robot watched the entire time.
His mouth was twisted to a smile. The robot wasn't supposed to have facial controls either.",0
"EDIT: I just realized No Mans Sky is an existing universe type deal and NOT the name given to the invasion for media purposes. With that in mind...
My codename is Red. I belong to a secret organization that employs soldiers like me to combat the dominant forces we uncover in alternate dimensions. Remotely, we operate trans-dimensional matter responders that eliminate the threats in our way of taking control. The metallic overcast that shades our planet now is a direct response from our latest efforts to rid the space invaders of dimension N1978. When they arrived 5 years ago, they pleaded for the slaughter in their dimension to stop. Earth eventually realized our precious gaming systems had been hijacked by my organization to harness the worlds collective gaming power to our advantage in dimensional domination. As a result, an agreement to a worldwide ban on gaming was reached and for a moment...There was a cease fire.
That's when I, and my fellow soldiers, were called up to activate. These past 5 years, me and my boys have completely eradicated any dominant lifeforms in dimension N1978. All that remains are the lifeforms contained with the ships over our heads, and their next.",0
"We all filed into the room. The man guiding me smelled like bad coffee and after shave, I could feel the humidity coming off of his hand on my shoulder. Sweaty palms, Christ he's more nervous than me and he doesn't even have a blind fold on. I wonder why.
The room we entered was interesting. So far. It smelled like old insulation mixed with dog slobber. For some reason it sent me back to the last time I was in school; the days of kickball and capture the flag. Gym class was the only thing I remembered or cared to pay attention to in grade school, I wonder why. They removed the blind folds and the picture began to get a bit clearer. The man guiding me was dressed like a referee, and we were in an old basketball gymnasium. The broken down Rec center kind that only gets used for AA meetings and craft fairs.
Why was I here? I'm pretty positive I'm not the smartest, or the dumbest person on the planet. Given, I did drop out of high school, but I've done alright for myself. I have a family, I support them enough.
""One question."" Said the referee. ""Where are we?"".
One man quickly shouted out ""A gymnasium dummy! "", the ref blew the whistle and two men in black suits came and dragged him out. Who's the dummy now.
Another woman, dressed in a multi colored frilly sweater and big glasses hesitantly let out ""the United States of America?""
Whisle. Gone.
At this point six others started to huddle together to brainstorm, while the remaining participant sat in the fetal position on the floor, sweating. Withdrawals, I thought, he probably hardly ever knows where he is.
This is inane, I thought. There was obviously only one answer to this.
""Right now, we are here.""
*tweeeeeeeeeeeeepth* the Referee let out a long screech with the whistle. ""You! Explain yourself, what do you mean?""
I took a long breath. ""Well, I could tell you that when we left Langley we got into a diesel 6 cylinder Van. I can tell you that we drove north west for 10 hours and it's now between 6:30 and 7pm. Which would put us somewhere in western New York or Pennsylvania. And I can tell you we drove around this building 3 times before parking, and entered in the east side of the building. But none of that would hold any weight. You took away our frame of reference. My senses could have easily been manipulated without having the sense of sight to anchor them. Not only that but in a 3 dimensional universe experienced through 4 dimension, the questions of ""where"" is always going to be relative, it can't be specific, or vague, without reference to another entity. If you want an absolute answer of where we are, the only one is ""here"". Acknowledging our presence in a shared reality, and that where we are now is different than whatever is beyond where we are now. It's the only answer. But we did enter on the east side of the building, that I'm sure of.""
The referee gave the whistle three toots. The walls of the building all fell backward. Props, it was a set. Across the parkinglot was Langley HQ. We were hardly a hundred yards from where we left. Figured, it kept sounding like the same cars were passing us for 10 hours.
""But how did you know we entered the east side?""
""You can take the explorer out of the woods. But you can't take the woods out of the explorer.""",0
"""Just a little further"" Stasi said as they walked through the forest. Miyakel was breathing hard, half from the quick pace his sister kept, half from fear of the unknown. Their father told them to stay away from this place; that a powerful wizard put a poisonous spell from all who entered. Normally they would heed papa's advice, but when the Smif sisters called them cowards them at school on Godday, he and his sister were compelled to travel here to save face from embarrassment.
They pass over a creak, and Stasi warned her sibling to not drink from it. ""We don't know how the wizard poisons people who come here, but it's best to avoid eating or drinking anything."" Miyakel dreaded the thought of getting sick and having to reveal the truth to father, so he resisted the urge to quench his thirst.
Their path was overgrown, but manageable. The ground was more covered than the roads in their town, but was too straight to be a coincidence. It was obvious, even to a child, that this once was created by people as a passage way for many folk. He envisioned a time when it was clear and large caravans traveled through this area in horses and carriages down this road.
Suddenly his sister put her hand out on his shoulder, and became instantly silent. Miyakel froze, worried that they had come across something sinister. Slowly, she pointed with her other hand. The young boy slowly followed with his eyes until he saw it. A metal pole, twice the his height with a sign on it. Metal was rare, and never used for such a luxury as a sign.
The writing was grey and dirty, but somehow Miyakel knew at one time they were colorful, that time had eroded all the brilliance the sign once had. He couldn't read the ancient text, some of the letters were clear like (CBL), while other appears backward (R) or upside down (A). Nonetheless the sounds he could construct from it made no sense to him.
However, he was transfixed by the symbol. It was a triangle, with what appeared to be a circle. However the circle was an illusion. It was circle but every other 1/6 was missing. Additionally the center was showing, but a ring around the center was also removed. Something had made this sign, and it did so very deliberately. Although he had never seen it before, this symbol was foreboding. His mind was fearful of the alien design.
Miyakel held his sister's hand and tilted his head back toward the village. He had seen enough and wanted to go home. Mother would be making a fresh batch of bread, and they still had firewood to gather for the stove. Stasi apparently felt the same. This was as far as they were willing to go. However she pulled out some paper and the piece of sharpened coal that father had gotten her from last Spring's carnival. She copied what she saw, hoping that one day she could make sense of the sign. After she finished, he watched her carefully open her satchel and place in it the paper that read: ""WARNING CHERNOBYL AHEAD.""",0
"""Please, do not panic. we do not wish you any harm"" said the crackled voice through our T.V. set. whatever this was, it had interfered with every electronic device that had speakers. hell, even the microwave was beeping in mores code.
that message played on loop, and everyone just stood around. i looked out of my 4th floor apartment down at the street, the disheveled hobo wearing nothing but a ripped trench coat and Heart-printed underwear ran around spouting ""The end is near, yall'!""
Pfft. I've seen enough movies to know that they will start to ask for help or something; that humanity will be the heroes because we are awesome. something like that.
i sat back in my Lazy boy and sipped on my morning coffee. still too hot. i noticed that the microwave had stopped sending that annoying high pitched beep. i turned my attention back to my crumby flat screen i bought from the shifty guy at the thrift store. i mean, who could pass up a 30 $Toshiba? that's great. too bad i later found out it was laced with cocaine, but i suppose that's what i get. still a great tv though.
the screen flickered between emergency news and the static that had previously made shadows dance around my empty apartment. another sip of my coffee; still too hot. finally it stopped broadcasting in all of the different languages and now let out its message. if I'm to be honest, i was partially expecting to see some grey aliens or short green knomes or something. what i did see was...ok, you know that pokemon that's made of like, purple tar, with the comical eyes and mouth? i think its called muck or something. anyways, it looked like that. i swear, the eyes looked like they took googley eyes out of the dollar store and just hot glued them to this crusty grey half-liquid.
""we are here to help your species"" ok, that's where i knew something was up. they are never 'good' if they want to help. they are going to put us into prisons or something. i've played halflife 2, this wont end well.
""before we presented ourselves, we needed to make sure that humanity has progressed enough to comprehend what we are about to give you. the first time we came, you insisted that we help you build giant stone triangles in the sand. the last time we had visited, your technology was sufficient enough but you were, and we quote ""beating those goddamn Nazi bastards"". so we waited; and let us say, you have done quite a lot. we have, however, noticed a couple areas that could be improved; like how some of your kind rejects the idea of being immune to polio. i mean, who gives that up? that's retarded! who the fuck would let their children die! I'm-""
the pokemon let out a sigh. a lighter, more purple muddy hand patted the main announcer on the side, mixing the two colors. kind of like when you start to mix 2 different kinds of playdoh. i think this would be a much worse mess to pick out though.
""anyways"" the blob continued. ""we were scared of...showing ourselves before. simply because before your generation of humans, there were the golden humans. those guys were dicks, you wouldn't believe. they were the most pretentious shits in the entire quadrant let me tell you. rivaled only by the Somonas. but they knew how to throw a rad party, so it made up for it.""
""damn"" i thought. ""they seem pretty chill, actually. this might end well. another sip. too hot -well, its getting there. damn its hard to pay attention to these guy's rabble without coffee. i can probably watch this on youtube later, or at least get the gist of it. for now, I'm going to take a nap."" and so i slept.",0
"NEDD looked down at the rhythmic sound of wood clanging against your gargantuan cloven hoof.
*sigh* what is the world coming to? That this semi-naked warrior with nothing but a wooden sword had reached his domain meant the guardians of all the lower levels had failed to prevent this nobody to pass, there was no way he could have actually bested them was there?
How had this human reached the feet of the Nether Elemental Daemon of Destruction, Unspoken Shadow King of the Greater Nether Realm and Lord of all the Arcane? He went by NEDD because his given name was horrendous, but he was still the most powerful warrior bar none! He stood protecting the gate to his mistress' layer and none had ever passed him. Few ever reached his gates and those that did normally took one look, bowed before him and backed away to find a less daunting prize.
The challenger took a final swing and his wooden sword staggered against his hoof. There was a mark on the armour plaiting but it looked like bits of wood ground against the chitinous plate, rather than any damage to his person. The challenger backed off and dropped the broken handle on the stone floor, littering was not something he liked but the maintenance goblins would be round later to clean up anyway so it wasn't a problem.
The tiny human shuffled his pouch and withdrew another wooden sword and resumed.
NEDD sighed and buried his face in his hand. This was growing tiresome. Standing from his basalt throne he paced to the other side of the room, far outpacing what an I enhanced human would be capable of. Once he reached the other side of the hall he turned and true enough the tiny human was only a third of the way to him.
Deciding to humour the creature he drew drew his blade and sliced the chain holding open the door. He stood at 40m high so when the 100m wide by 50m high door fell it released a tremendous shockwave that knocked the human skidding across the floor. It stood up and looked around for it's sword. It was gone.
NEDD paced across the room and hauled open a draw inset to the wall. The door was enchanted so that when it closed it would disarm challengers, anything held in their hands would be teleported to this draw. He picked through the contents and found what he was looking for. He picked up the jewel studded necklace and for humour grabbed the wooden sword.
He glanced over to where the human stood watching him and threw the sword and necklace so they skidded to within a few meters of the challenger. The human moved to pick up the items and NEDD sat down again on his throne.
For a daemon NEDD had a particularly nice voice, it was deep and strong and reverberated so that you felt the lower consonants rather than hearing them. ""What brings you to this place mortal?"" NEDD was technically mortal too but he could pull off the look and did so as his standard greeting to challengers.
The human spoke but being so far away and so quiet he could not be heard. NEDD cut him off ""Put on the necklace! You should have crafted one with the sisters of Thaler's Vale?""
It was a statement left hanging that demanded a response and as he human put on the necklace he received one.
""Hello, I'm Peter.""
NEDD's brow furrowed, that was not quite as informing as he hoped. Just being blunt might work better.
""How did you get here?""
""I ran most of the way.""
Again not really telling him anything useful.
""What...How..."" NEDD paused and grumbled to himself before speaking loudly but clearly ""I dislike pointless threats but you may not have realised that I am a guardian of this hall! I can CRUSH you with almost no effort and will do so without hesitating. How exactly did you make your way past all the previous guardians?""
The human paused ""killed them.""
Now that was interesting ""Go on...""
""I was created by an incredibly powerful Mage. Born under a new moon that coincided with a solar eclipse at midday on the winter solstice. Conceived with no mother. 7 virgin sacrifices fuelled my creation and the blood of a thousand warriors.""
NEDD raised an eyebrow, ""and they call you Peter?""
""Well I had to be called something didn't I?""
""And they chose Peter...""
""Why is the name Peter the part you're questioning here?""
""I just struggle to see how they'd go to all that trouble and name you something as banal as Peter.""
""Mhmhehmmm"" The challenger mumbled
""What was that?""
""If you really must know, Peter is not my given name. It was my wizard creator's name and I took it when I killed him""
""Now that is more believable, now onto the rest of your tale. You don't look very..."" Peter looked at him questioningly ""...threatening.""
""Well I'm not really, I don't have super human strength or the gift of otherworldly magic. I'm clever but not nearly as sharp as a magically enhanced mind. I'm fairly squishy, I cut easily, I'm regularly seriously injured by plants and rocks that are just lying about. I have a ludicrously high pain threshold but I'm really very easy to kill.""
""I'm sorry, I must have missed something. How do you plan on getting past me?""
""Well that's simple"" and with a smile he took his pathetic wooden sword and sliced his own neck open.""
""Oh..."" that was rather anticlimactic.
But then Peter stood up ""I've been killed literally thousands of time getting here, but never permanently. The early guardians took a few attempts to learn how to kill them, some of them just got worn down over time. A few just let me past because they got bored of killing me. If I'm killed very badly I'll loose any armour I have which I why I only have a wooden sword but I won't ever stop.""
""Oh, that does explain allot.""
Peter and NEDD just looked at each other for a while before Peter spoke. ""So what now?""
""What a question!"" NEDD leapt to his hooves and swept across the room. In two paces he was at Peter and he swung his feet in an arc.
Peter died first upon contact with several tones of very solid hoof. He then redirected in the air just long enough to regret starting this, before he smashed into the stone wall and his head exploding.
""What now Peter? What now?""
The human stood, drenched in warm fresh blood. In front of him NEDD burst into flame and drew a pair of swords that probably sighed more than a house each. ""Now I face an opponent worthy of my effort!""
The fire elemental pointed his sword at Peter and the world turned to flame. Before he was roasted for the first of many times Peter thought 'here we go again'.",0
"Aisir awoke inside the ruins of the ship. He began to move, only to halt at the sharp stabbing sensations emanating from his side. It hurt to breathe somewhat. He tried to move his limbs, only to realize they too had become immobile.
""Curse it all..."" He groaned to himself, as he began tugging at the harness. Eventually after some brute force, the restraints snapped loose. Aisir leaned far enough right to topple into the floor. The emergency lights lit the way to the exit. But for the time being, all Aisir could think of was the pain.
""Lieutenant Aisir...What is your status? Lieutenant, do you read?""
""Yeah, Bertha'll, I read."" Aisir squeezed out between gasps as he laid on the floor of the craft.""
""What is your status? Our scanners have lost your craft. Please report status...""
""Status..."" Aisir forgot for a moment. Clawing his way to the bulkhead, he realized how badly wounded he actually was. The gash protruding from his side had cause him to lose a considerable amount of fluid. He could see the pinkish trail as he rolled to his left for a brief moment.
""Lieutenant?"" The voice reminded him.
""Ship is down."" Aisir breathed overcoming his nausea, ""Repeat ship down...On surface of planet C130-B97, planet under observation...Respond Bertha'll.""
""C130-B97, or as inhabitant species dubbed; Earth. Correct lieutenant?""
""Confirmed Bertha'll...Contact leadership of Quadrant, *erggh*, ASAP.""
""Maintain communication..."" Aisir continued crawling toward the emergency release hatch as the call connected itself over the next minute.
""Captain De'Xor responding. Report status lieutenant.""
""Sir..."" Aisir panted, ""Ship has been shot down. Contact made. Life support destroyed...They have weaponry, sir. Weaponry, we did not anticipate.""
""Impossible."" The captain replied, ""Our studies showed that the beings prefer war between themselves, lieutenant. Why would they have anti-ship capability?""
""I don't know how, but they do."" Aisir said as he pulled himself some more. ""They've apparently expected such a thing to occur. Scouting this planet was a mistake, sir.""
""Pull yourself together!"" The captain commanded. Aisir breathed more to calm himself as he listened. ""You are Lieutenant Aisir, Bertha'll base personnel; of the Andromeda Federation. Stand strong!""
""I'm standing the *best I can*, sir."" Aisir explained, as he gripped the release lever. The hatch exploded off, causing him to be blinded by the light. Aisir toppled out of the craft. Landing on the ground two yards below did not help his injuries. He felt something crack, and became rather feint. Lying prone again he glanced at his surroundings.
""Activate, video transmission."" Aisir said as the device activated.
--
Captain De'Xor demanded the operators to open the feed. They were greeted a view of the ground, followed by Aisir's arms as he made his way to the top of the shallow crater. Rolling again, Aisir faced what appeared to be a path of some sort, made of black material. A yellow line streaking the center led to confusion of what the surface meant amongst the crowd. De'Xor gestured for silence.
""Oh...Oh...Curse it all."" Aisir groaned, ""Bertha'll come in...Do you have the feed?""
""We do lieutenant."" De'Xor replied.
""You shouldn't...you shouldn't..."" Aisir continued, the feed turning towards the horizon; green fields, buildings and a bright, blue sky, stretched away from him.
""By the Council...It's...It's *beautiful*...I've never seen anything like it...""
""Respond Aisir."" De'Xor asked quietly.
""Never come here."" He pleaded, ""Please. Never come here...Tell my child, I'm sorry...Captain, please, *tell my child. * Tell my family *I'm sorry*....""
""Lieutenant,"" De'Xor responded ""I command you-""
He paused as they listened for a moment. Something had arrived nearby. A ship perhaps? The crowd shrieked as the camera rolled over to face the sky, and a masked being aiming what appeared to be a large photon at what would be Aisir's face. They listened as Aisir gasped hard for air, his lungs taking it in as much as possible. Then; he became still. Eventually, another being stepped into view. This one wore all black, and was less heavily armed. Eventually he motioned for the armored one to lower his weapon.
""He's gone."" The being stated, ""Sit rep. Secure the area. Call in Biological for extract.""
""Sir, yes sir."" The armored being replied.
The feed lost connection soon after, and Da'Xor was left consider what to tell the Council, as well as how to approach the lieutenant's next of kin.

"He stood there, looking as his own grave.
Fog hung low in the air, the visceral substance forming an eerie wall around the lonely cemetery.
The dirt caked on his boots seemed to weigh him down, anchoring the dejected man to his spot. Even if he wanted to run, he would be tethered here by obligation.
""Do it, Francis."" A voice sounded somewhere behind the troubled man, but he didn't turn around to acknowledge it. Yet for some reason, it continued to speak. ""You know why you're here. We all know why.""
The man could hear footsteps behind him, yet he still didn't turn.
""You *killed* her, Francis. It's all your fault.""
""No."" The man uttered the word feebly at first, unsure of its validity. He said it again, this time more firmly. ""NO.""
Turning around, Francis confronted his accusers. The gaunt face of a woman stared hard at him; behind her stood myriad cloaked individuals, their faces hidden from view.
""Jessica is dead and it's all your fault, Francis.""
""It wasn't my fault. You're wrong.""
""It was. You simply can't admit it. You can never take responsibility.""
""Shut UP! You have no idea what you're talking about-""
""I know *exactly* what I'm talking about!"" The woman began to move in closer to Francis, her tone becoming more and more menacing. ""The whole town knows what you've done! *She* knows what you've done!""
The woman pointed past Francis at the grave he had been pensively considering prior. The man turned, wide-eyed in horror.
A small child, a girl, was climbing out of the grave, eyes sunken, skin pale. Her matted hair obscured her features, but Francis knew exactly who she was. He wanted with all his being to scream, to run, to move from the spot where he currently stood. But he couldn't. He was anchored in place.
""NO."" The only word that the man could say began to sound like a confirmation. ""No, no, no, no NO!""
The child grabbed Francis by his shirt, ripping the man forward, shattering his unseen tether. She pulled him to the edge of the grave, just enough for him to lose his balance. The man toppled over the edge, crashing down to the earthen floor below.
""I'm sorry,"" Francis sobbed. He laid in the dirt, curled up in a fetal position. ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm *so*, *so sorry*.""
The man stayed there for a while. He had no grasp on the passing of time. When he finally raised his head, there was no girl, there was no crowd gathered at the edge of the grave, there was no woman with her sharp words.
Just him, his guilt, and his grave.",0
"""Shit. You see me, don't you?""
Thomas's mouth refused to move as he watched the tall cloaked figure. Everything felt cold and clammy. This was it. He knew this was it.
""Look don't freak out...just...pretend I'm not here!"" Death said while waving his hand in front of his shadow that refused to reveal a face in any light.
""I...it's not my time...I don't—"" Thomas was cut off.
""Calm down! You might be old but you only came here for a kidney stone for Christ's sake! Must have been a pretty big one if you can see me!"" Death laughed feebly.
Thomas's fear had not fully melted away, but had fused with his confusion and curiosity to form butterflies that pressed and ached in his stomach.
Thomas finally found the words, ""Th-thank you?""
""So...Thomas right? And no, I don't know everything. I do know everything about anything in my general vicinity. It's pretty useful. And generally annoying considering how many useless things I walk by on a daily basis,"" Death rambled, pausing awkwardly and staring at Thomas searchingly.
""I'm sorry, but have we met before? Oh right! Your Aunt Agnes! Quite sorry about that, didn't mean to take her at dinner, she just clearly wanted to leave and nearly jumped into my arms once she saw me. Your mother's cooking must have got to her!"" Death gave up on jokes after this.
""I...why are you here? Is someone dying?"" Thomas asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.
""Well, yes but that's just my day job. The Night Guy will get those ones,"" Death said wearily.
""It's a thankless job, really. I help prevent overpopulation and make sure you don't have to support all the incurably sick and wounded and half of you are terrified of me! I mean, double that for the Night Guy, but I don't really blame them. He can be a bit intimidating with the scythe and all,"" Death went on.
""Okay...so why are you here?"" Thomas questioned, growing slightly more comfortable in the casualness of this unforeseen and supposed-to-be-unseen visitor.
""It's my hobby. Hospitals are great for it,"" he said.
""What hobby?"" Thomas did not know what kind of hobby Death would have.
After a short pause, Death spoke, ""You know what, it'll be easier to show you.""
Suddenly Thomas was on his feet looking at his body.
""OH GOD I—""
""No you're not! God, you're squeamish! I just thought the nurses would find it weird if you were walking around at 2AM talking to yourself after having a kidney stone. So I took your soul out. Temporarily,"" Death said as he calmingly patted him on the back.
""Temporarily?""
""Temporarily.""
""Let's go! I don't want to miss it!"" Death said, gitty and excited.
______
Thomas and Death came to a small room labelled 4b. Thomas could only imagine what was inside: open heart surgeries, mangled limbs, dusty old men who might as well be corpses.
The door opened to a woman holding a crying baby. Death walked into the room, through the door silently. Thomas followed, half terrified, half curious.
""There, there honey,"" the woman said as the baby cried, ""it's okay. I know. I know.""
The baby's whines soon disappeared as she held the now sleeping child in her arms.
And for the first time, Thomas saw the eyes of Death. They were green. A very normal but bright green.
""So far away from me. It's beautiful, isn't it?"" He said as part of the shadow of his face seemed to contort in what Thomas could only assume was a smile.
Thomas replied, ""Yeah. Yeah it's beautiful.""
They sat there in silence for a while until finally, Death turned to Thomas and said, ""Well Thomas, it's been nice but you need to get back to your body before someone higher up, or down low for that matter, notices. It's been nice talking. Maybe I'll see you again, outside of work, I mean.""
______
And with that, Thomas awoke the next day feeling oddly fulfilled from that strange, vivid dream he had.

"""You'll probably feel nauseous when you come to again,"" one of the researchers said as he double checked the fastenings on my suit. Cry pajamas, they jokingly called it.
""Scratch that, you'll definitely feel nauseous,"" he continued. The other scientists circulated around the room like cogs in a machine. Keyboards clacked and sheets of paper were moved around as the final preparations for initiating cryosleep were in effect.
I didn't care much for it all. I always looked forward to a nap, so I figured this wouldn't be any different. If anything, it would be the best damn sleep I'll have in my life. No more work to worry about, or anything else for that matter. My responsibilities faded away, and I excitedly began to wonder what would be awaiting me on the other side.
Mind you, it would only be a decade past. This is the farthest they've sent the other test subjects, and from what I understand the science behind it is still too fuzzy to try for longer periods of time. In any case, there's comfort in knowing that it's been done before and that I'm not just some kind of lab rat being toyed around with by some fresh college graduates hoping for the best but expecting the worst. Nah, this is legit. As legit as it gets.
""Last chance to back out,"" quipped one of the other researchers. She was kinda cute--I always liked her. ""Wait for me on the other side and I might just take you out to dinner,"" I told her. That drew a smile from her. ""But I'll be old and decrepit and you'll still be the same age,"" was her reply. ""Don't worry, I prefer the older types anyway."" Another smile. Nailed it.
Two others approached me and led me backwards into the cryo chamber. Even with the suit on I could feel the chill emanating from inside. Once I was submerged in the water, that was that. No more communication, though I could see the group giving me thumbs up and a-okays through the glass. It wasn't long after that I went under. *This is it*, I thought. This was the big one. *The big sleep*. Hopefully not that kind, though.
*To be continued...*",0
"When I was a child, I would always dream that I had wings and I would fly all over the town. I always told my parents that I am a superhero and they would pat me on the head with smiles.
The wonderful exhiliration of jumping off the roof of our house and flying off made me want to sleep all day. Sometimes I would dream that I have a friend who will fly with me and he always bring me fighting in the streets with him.
One dream, I was flying as usual with my friend and we touched down on the ground. I dreamt that I was singing when all of a sudden, a man in a black suit appeared. He looked normal with dark hair and pale skin but he wasn't moving from where he stood. I grabbed my friend's arm and told him we need to run.
We ran and then I flied but my friend can't. He looked scared. I flew away from him and when I looked back, he's gone.
I woke up crying to my parents that my friend is gone and the man in the suit took him. They simply gave me extra syrup for breakfast.
The next night, I was afraid to sleep because I was afraid of whatever took my friend but soon enough, I fell asleep. I dreamt that I was flying and then I saw the man standing on the rooftop. The moment our eyes met, I suddenly fell. I screamed as I fell towards the ground. I woke up crying for my mom.
Up until now, I still dreamt of the guy in the black suit. I have a fear of falling now and a certain distrust with man in suits. You just can't trust them.",0
"""Thing is, Nolan, criminals shouldn't feel offended at being called roaches.""
The reporter raised an eyebrow at me from across the coffee table. We were in a Starbucks on a Friday night, full of chatty teenagers. Sometimes, either one of us would need to raise our voices to be heard. ""Why is that, Mr. Clay?""
I sipped my coffee. ""See, we got one thing in common with those dirty sons of bitches. When the light comes on, we run.""
""Yet earlier, you said you're different.""
""Tell me, do you trust the government?""
Nolan shrugged. ""I don't think my opinion—""
""Answer the damned question.""
""Not really. I mean, everyone knows they're spying on us. Even as a journalist, I don't always get to—""
""So if you ordinary folk don't trust the government, what makes you think criminals will? Come forth and let your sins be washed away, as long as you committed them in this or that year, arbitrarily chosen by your man in that big white house?""
I scoffed. ""Was brought up Christian, you know. Far as I know, only one fella can pardon you. Humans ain't so forgiving or forgetful.""
Nolan's expression became thoughtful. ""Last year, the government chose 2012. Fifty-six people came forward with confessions.""
""I saw the newspapers. Eighty murders in total, along with a bunch of petty crimes. One woman ate six of her neighbors' cats. Hilarious.""
""Really? I don't see what's funny about that.""
I laughed. ""The cats? Who cares about the cats? I'm talking about the math. Eighty murders? There are several times that number of homicides alone in New York City, let alone the state or the country. Doesn't that prove what I've been saying? Criminals don't want a spotlight on them. How many of those fifty-six ended up being re-arrested for other crimes in other un-pardoned years?""
""More than half."" Before I could interrupt, he said, ""Let's revisit my earlier question. Why, then, are you keen on publicity?""
""You're making me blush. I don't know what you're talking about.""
""1978. You murdered seven people. Or so you confessed.""
""Eight, actually. She was looking for her mom and dad, and wouldn't stop crying.""
Nolan blanched, but turned a page on his notebook. ""1996. A shooting in Central Park. Fifteen dead, including two police officers.""
I shrugged. ""I wanted to clear the air. The Russian mob was making their move; I was only defending myself. Everyone accused my organization of being responsible. But that's nothing compared to the bus bomb bank robbery in December.""
""I understand you were arrested for that.""
""Released two years later when the government decided to pardon that year."" I leaned forward and motioned for him to come closer. ""Listen, you wanna know what I think? The real reason behind these pardons?"" His eyes gained a hungry look. ""Yes, you can write this down.""
""I think the government just wanted a way to pardon their own people. You know, the assassinations and the espionage and the sabotage and spying, on Americans by Americans. Those guys in suits, working for all those three-acronym agencies, they do a lot more shit than us. Why else would they pardon crimes from 1999 to 2001?""
Nolan licked his lips and didn't answer, jotting furiously.
Smirking, I leaned back. ""Besides, when you confess, you get a reputation. Respect. No, not from local shrimps. The big players. 2001 was a pretty great year for me. Sold a lot of intel to foreign players.""
""You didn't confess that,"" Nolan said.
""Off the record, please."" I drained my cup of coffee and looked at my watch. ""Well, the biggest one was still 2012, of course. I believe you wrote the article. 'Crime lord comes clean; biggest theft of the century'.""
""Man, those banks and financial institutions just don't get it, do they? It's the information age! Security first; efficiency and whatnot second. Twenty billion. Twenty and frickin' loads of zeroes. That's what they get for underestimating Chinese tech.""
Nolan nodded and flipped a page. ""Let's move to the big question, shall we? You're making a confession tomorrow for 2015; care to give me the scoop?""
I grinned. ""How about a riddle? The Vietnamese ambassador. Fourteen train carriages. Can't be giving you everything, right? You a journalist, do some research. Texan governor. The four judges. The Syrian massacre.""
Nolan gulped. ""I...I guess I have some reading to do.""
""Sure you do. Well, I think we'll be seeing each other in court tomorrow.""
We stood and shook hands. As I turned to leave, a young man whose face was full of piercings came up to me. ""You Mr. Clay?""
I nodded.
He pushed a gun into my chest and opened fire. There was screaming, and a lot of people running, but I couldn't turn my head much from the floor. The boy backed away as Nolan crouched beside me.
""There's a reason why roaches don't show themselves,"" he said softly. ""Because, eventually, all pests meet the same end. You're a big man, Mr. Clay, but too arrogant for your own good. Just because the government wouldn't touch you, doesn't mean we won't.""
""And guess what?"" He took the gun from the young man's hand and held it against my temple. ""Next year, when the government decides 2016 was a great year, they wouldn't even hold this against me.""

"The clock ticked a-rhythmically and uncomfortably while the HR rep contracted out for recruitment leafed through the application and resume with a degree of humming and teeth whistling.
The room was slightly too cold, the rep has adjusted it down and was dressed accordingly with the applicant feeling the chill dressed as he was for the subtropics. Subtly looking about the room he noticed how nothing was quite comfortable, from the flickering light, the clock tick and the chair which pinched in places except for the rep's chair which looked discretely luxurious.
""Well, that's all in order. Your tax forms are altogether, ID checks out and the referees I've called have mostly confirmed everything""
""mostly‽"" exclaimed the applicant quizzically.
""oh don't fret, just two didn't return my phone calls. But i followed up, The uh Regurgitator apparently passed on Blood Island after a run in with a U.N. taskforce sent to recover the warhead you very successfully purloined from the Reunited Republic of Korea. As for The Stink in Franchescaville they vanished though I am informed this was at the same time one of the caped kinds had an epiphany about the nature of murder and morality. So one makes assumptions but other sources tell me your work was commendable."" the representative quickly drummed his fingers on the desk and appearing to consider something.
Time ticked slowly away.
""anyway, back to the task at hand. Now it's important for me stress that this will be a different arrangement to your usual fare. Full time retainment with loyalty clauses opposed to the more freelance style of contract you are more familiar with. Annual pay will seem smaller than a 'good year' ""the air quotes went un-gestured but very much inflected. ""but I think you'll find the reliable income and other benefits more than make up for it"".
Tension in the room jumped suddenly as a chrome revolver was produce from a drawer in the desk and dropped on the table. The applicant became aware of a coppery tang to the air and tried not to look at the wall behind him. ""now you may know me as The Recruiter and of the many things i do this is my trademark, you don't have a say in this anymore and it's up to me accept you for the contract or...terminate it before it even begins.""",0
"It's another normal day in Westfield except something's a little off. While I've been running off the locals from the graveyard to rob the deceased, I've been dressing as a zwombie and using a projection to fool police. It's a small town so keeping the word from getting out was easy. Cut a few telephone lines and flatten a few tires and no one will ever know. Today was different though, this morning a can pulled in.
I immediately flatten the front tires so they can't escape. After watching them for a little bit, I can't help but notice they're some sort of mystery solving group. Are they fucking kidding me? A stoner and his dog, some preppy looking douche, a librarian and a slut? Who are these people? I can't let them leave and I need to hide the evidence. Once I find the grave of the nobleman who was buried here and his treasure I can leave but I can't have them snooping around.
I already had some open graves dug so I waited for them to come liking around the graveyard. This is going to be too easy, I'm going to use the projector to scare them right into running into the graves. Something unexpected happened though. The dog started digging up the treasure. How the fuck did he find it? That's ok though, these kids are about to get it.
I scared preppy boy and the slut into a hole that is too muddy to escape. The librarian lost her fucking glasses and crawled into a crypt that I locked behind her. As for the stoner and dog, pot brownies sitting on a tombstone really got the best of them.
While I was going to kill them, I decided against it. They never saw me and I got all the treasure. These dumb fucks literally just helped me finish even faster. I should really leave some money for those tires though...",0
"""It's the end of the World!"" Mario screamed while punching the wall in our locker room.
""It's not buddy, relax. Time will pass, it will go away"" I knew my words mean't nothing but I had to pretend they did.
""It won't go away! Not something like this!"" He said while still punching. He must of had a few broken knuckles by now.
I didn't know what else to say. These things happened every year, in every school across the country. You laugh at it when it's some stranger's story on a blog, but when it's your best friend...
Hazing was a common tradition for football teams but that didn't mean things couldn't cross the limit. A broomstick in the ass? What was the point of that?

"I rebuttoned my jeans up as I made my way back through the great city of Rome. I wasn't worried about being seen by the locals, the cloaking would take care of that. For all they knew there was nobody walking down the street with a freshly sucked dick and a smile as big as the colosseum.
The rendezvous site was between two pillars, I would meet Jeremy there and we would go back to the future. We'd been paired up as time buddies, making sure that neither of us tried to stay. There was a big deal at Two Timers about paradoxes, but I wasn't paying much attention to that.
We'd built up quite the bond during our time together as Time buddies, we would discuss how things went if we were going to look for a new girl, our lives at home. I spent an hour every three days with the man, so he and I had become fast friends, and we had made a pact to make every Wednesday from this day on blowjob day.
We chatted for a moment before being wrapped up in the time stream, a nice blue middle area between times. It was where the HQ of Two Timers was. At the helm today was Trisha, who was looking over papers when we ported in.
""Hi, Trish!"" Jeremy said, he always left a big tip with her, and she usually redid the top button of her blouse when he left.
""Hey Jeremy,"" she said, not looking up from her paperwork, ""2056 right?""
""That's the year,"" I said with a smile, man it felt good to have someone who wanted you.
""Sounds good,"" she tapped a few buttons and pressed the large red one, a large ERROR popped up on her screen, ""Ah shit,"" she said looking up to us, ""What did you guys do?""
""We went and cheated on our wives,"" I said while rolling my eyes.
""No, like, what exactly did you do?""
""Well,"" Jeremy began, ""It's blowjob Wednesday.""
""Blowjob,"" Trisha lost volume, ""Wednesday""
""Yeah,"" I said.
""So did you fuck your partner?"" She was looking at me with a panicked face, ""or did you just get a blowjob.""
""She blew me.""
""Motherfucker,"" she said, slamming her papers down, ""We send you back to FUCK hot chicks guys.""
""So?""
""That sperm she swallowed was Emperor Nero, who was supposed to be born from you,"" she pointed at me, ""and now the timeline we are from doesn't exist.""
""Fuck,"" I said grabbing my comb-over, ""What can we do about that?""
""Well I can't send you back to the same day twice,"" she tapped her pen on her stack of papers, ""but there is a way that we can make this work.""
""How, we need to turn this around!""
""If we change enough of the timeline that things end up extremely similar, we might be able to go to that timeline,"" she said looking at her papers, ""but you guys are going to need to fuck a lot of chicks.""
""I don't know man,"" Jeremy turned to me, ""Are you up for this?""
""Yeah, I think so,"" I said, looking down at my fly. It was time for the love hammer to bang this timeline back into place.",0
"This quilt, that my mother made,
Still makes me think to this day.
It's softest brown, and brightest blue,
The curved stitch here, reads ""made it May"".
It's hard to see, but believe me it's true,
That's not just a cloth but a piece of shirt.
You can see a logo here, and right there,
And a signature over there, someone named ""Bert"".
This is my favorite part, a piece from a stuffed bear.
I think it was my mother's favorite too,
She always said so at least.
Something from when she was two,
Given by her grandad for Thanksgiving feast.
My dad added this, a little button pin,
Something from his mother, for being a scout.
Apparently she went to a store and fished in a bin,
Until night that day, to teach him what love was about.

"He scratched the back of his neck as he yelled to his wife, ""Honey! Where did I put my keys?"" He was always losing his damn keys, but they always seemed to be in the same place. Either in his coat pocket or on the table. One thing was for sure, his wife would always know exactly where they were.
""They're on the table in the foyer"" She yelled from the nursery.
Of course, there they were. On his drive to work, he thought about the issues of the day and how they would affect his family. Ever since the breakthrough government system that was implemented ten years ago, things have never been better. Crime rates were down and as a result, the number of prisons that have closed is amazing. People are being treated for mental illnesses and not just thrown in an environment where they won't get help. The government has never been more productive. He rubbed the back of his neck as he felt the small bump. He knew it was a neural implant, can't remember what it does. Suddenly, he remembered the Royals were doing pretty well this year and it would be cool if they won the crown. They had done fairly well the previous year and have a pretty good chance.
He arrived at work and went to his cubical. Although it was fairly early, his coworkers all arrived by 7:30. Just like every day. After he put his black leather briefcase down, he made his rounds to catch up with everyone. He noticed everyone else had bumps too; on the back of the neck, just above the spine. Why does everyone have these implants again? What are they for? Damn, the weather has been great this weekend. He returned to his desk and got to work.
Something kept bothering him though. Everything he said, everyone agreed with. Whether it be political views, who should win the Super Bowl, or even favorite foods. Every time he would think about it he would suddenly get distracted.
But still, life was good and the government is on his side.
Just like everyone else.

"To be fair, I'm always a little intimidated to talk to any kind of stranger, let alone a girl with long brown hair and deep green eyes and a propensity for wearing low-cut shirts. This feeling is familiar--my heart is in my throat, the adrenaline is surging, I can barely breathe let alone think let alone keep my throat clear so my voice comes out smooth and even, as if talking to her is just the easiest thing in the world. This is normal.
And yet. I'm sure this time is different. This time she is making me feel the way that I feel, I mean actively sensing that I am looking at her and as a result making my throat close up, my pulse quicken, my palms sweat and my entire theoretical life with her flash before my eyes, punctuated by sex with her, often, forever. She is a God.
How else to explain the fact that she has never raised her hand once, or even been called on to speak, despite sitting right there in the front, close to the door. How else to reconcile the fact that not even the football player, who comes into this class to take the exams and nothing else, tries to hit on her after class as I see all other football players in all my other classes do to all the other beautiful girls? How else can it be that this person is so incredibly gorgeous, and is not already married and living in a castle somewhere, whisked away by a handsome actor with a trust fund? She is unreal. She is too good to be true. She is unapproachable, especially by the likes of me, and she knows it, and she wants me to know that she knows it. She knows I have figured her out and she is trying to put me off, like she does with everyone else.
But: It's the last day of class. We will hand in a paper next week to complete our coursework. We will no longer sit here and discuss the differences between Sikhism and Buddhism, or parse through Masuzawa's texts. We will go home and pretend this never happened, most likely--happy to have passed and to move on. But for me, this class won't end until I talk to her, and find out if she's real. I will not be dissuaded.
The time has come. The clock has struck noon and the professor has dismissed us. We rise, more or less in unison, gathering our things and nodding silently at each other or ignoring the world. I see her already moving towards the door, and through it, and out into the hallway.
I race out to find her, and see her hair disappearing down the stairwell. My feet feel heavy as I clomp after her. My body has not yet caught up with my brain and refuses to believe we are trying to move this quickly in this direction. I want to call out, but not only does my mouth fail to work, I don't even know her name.
I round into the grey stairwell and see her a flight below, almost out of sight. It is truly now or never.
Hey, I say, down the stairs at her receding shadow. I say it quietly, but it echoes along the concrete and I see the shadow cease moving.
I walk down the stairs and approach her, as she turns to me.
Hey, I say again. I realize I haven't planned for this, that I was sure she would disappear in a puff of smoke if I actually reached her. I fumble for the next words.
What'd you think of the class? I manage to blurt out.
She simply smiles and raises an eyebrow. Then she speaks, and the force of her voice pushes me against the wall of my own mind. I am standing stock still and yet blown away to hear the words come out of her mouth.
""It was interesting. Never thought I'd take a class like that and actually like it. Wanna grab coffee and talk about the final?"" she says, easy as a hand through fur, as a light beer into the glass.
Sure, I say, and put out my hand. I tell her my name, and we walk out of the stairwell and into the sun.

"‘ …and we'll have an interview with him and his prize marrow at around a quarter to eight. The time is six-fifty-five, and this is BBC Southern Counties Radio. ’
The daily news blares over the radio. Light rolls through the curtains. I turn over in bed. Just another Monday morning. Minutes pass, and I hear all the familiar sound. Cars on the road outside. My flatmates stirring in their rooms. The world is waking up.
I struggle out from my cocoon of blankets and into the cold of my bedroom. I like it that way. Every night I open the my window, to let the night in. Every morning the chill startles me awake. I open the curtains, look out onto the street. The usual crowd waltz down the street, going wherever it is they go. Someone glances up at my window, and hurriedly looks away as they realise I'm half naked.
As I walk across the room something crunches underfoot. A small, folded piece of paper on the floor. My name is written on it, in my own handwriting. I pick it up, scrutinise it. I don't remember writing this. I open it, and read the words inside.
*Act normally, otherwise they'll notice. *
I'm confused. I really don't recall writing this. What does it mean? Who are ‘ they ’? The questions are rattled from my head by a knock at my bedroom door. My flatmate.
‘ Huney, are you ok in there? You'll be late. ’
I look at the note again. And hesitate.",0
"""Well that wasn't my brightest moment.""
""It certainly dwarfed all of your previous mistakes.""
""I'm not sure you appreciate the gravity of your new situation.""
""Haha yeah, it was a 'red giant' mistake, right guys?""
From the primordial soup of silence to the surging spark of life to the astrophysical abortion, all in the span of a minute; entropy bled out the momentum of the conversation into the open expanse of the observatory's eggshell dome. Some sad social cousin of alchemy or chemistry produced a faint stench of nerd sweat, the final embarrassed exudate of the odd man out of the odd men within.
We all pointedly gazed back into our own private lenses, and poor Marvin was left staring once more into his own personal abyss.",0
"Hans was never a ""bright"" child by any measure. He scored average in just about every capacity: IQ, grades, sports. Everything he tried, he was *average*. His parents didn't really know what to do with him. He was now 8 years old, had a few friends, never really exhibiting talents or a profinity for anything. On a whim his father purchased a stuffed dragon, roughly the size of an average baby. It was a vibrant green color, deep like an emerald yet just as brilliant. It had horns resembling a reindeer's, and a pearly white beard under its chin. Its body was long and slender like a snakes, yet girthy enough to hold and hug. The day his father gave him Sam, is a day he'll never forget.
Hans sat there, playing with the few toys he had as his father called his attention. He looked up to see Sam placed right before him. At first he was confused. It was a weekday and usually weekends were the time for gifts and treats. Maybe he did something special the day before, he wasn't usually aware of these things and often forgot his own actions. Now all his attention was transfixed on the wonderfully verdant creature before him. He reached out to hold his new companion, ""Wait, what do you say, Hans?""
""Thanks, daddy.""
""You're welcome. Have you decided his name yet?"" his father asked as he handed Hans the plush animal.
""Sam.""
His father sighed. He thought he might provoke some hidden creativity in the boy, alas it was the name of a family dog who died a year prior of old age. After a few weeks, his father would grow to like the name and almost regard fictional creature as a household pet. Hans brought Sam with him everywhere: school, bed, trips to the doctor, even church despite the protests of his mother. His father saw that it wasn't about what Sam did with the toy, it was the connection he made with his inanimate friend. Soon, they began to see Hans use Sam in imaginary play, something that eluded Hans previously. Sam had a whole family, Hans would tell his parents, that lived on Jupiter (they were learning about the solar system that week) and used special walkie talkies to communicate to Earth. Hans couldn't understand Sam's language, but he would read Sam's facial expressions and could tell if the conversation was good or bad. He picked this up when his parents were talking, thinking he couldn't hear or see them.
Then, he started drawing. And painting. By the time Hans was 12, he moved on to more difficult mediums like pastel and oil. His parents were not only impressed, but thrilled. Their son actually *was* talented. It was a shame when he got sick and couldn't paint anymore. Hans'health started to deteriorate around his 14th birthday. His parents first noticed his lack of energy, then it evolved into notes from his teachers that he was sleeping in class. Eventually, his symptoms grew to frequent migraines, crippling him from attending school or even leaving his bed. Sam was constantly by his side, Hans even refused to let his mother give him his monthly washing. It didn't take long for a diagnosis, a malignant brain tumor that was spreading quickly. Sometimes these things happen for no reason, the doctor told his parents, there's not much they can do besides surgery and immediate treatment. Treatment meant chemotherapy, which his mother already went through with her mother. She was reluctant at first, but because of the doctor's ushering - she relented.
It was a warm summer day in early June when Hans went in for his weekly chemotherapy treatment. During the summer, his treatments were in the morning so he could have the remainder of the day to paint. At least, he would try to paint. Nausea and fatigue would usually follow his treatments confining him to his bed most days. The gentle breeze kissed his naked forehead, partially covered by a baseball cap to mask his bald head. He liked to keep the windows down when they drove, the wind helped cool his face and keep him from vomiting. As they pulled into the hospital parking lot, Hans clutched Sam to his chest. Sometimes the nurses wouldn't let him bring Sam in, today they promised he could join him. As he approached the hospital doors, Hans got nauseous and had to stop for minute. He considered running away, far from the hospital so he didn't have to go back. He was old enough to know that it wasn't possible. He wasn't strong enough.
Once they got to the treatment room, Hans noticed there weren't any other patients. Usually there were a few, but he was the only teenager. There was another kid he would talk to sometimes, but he passed away a month prior from leukemia. His dad dropped him off today, he had a few errands to run so Hans was alone with Sam during his treatment. After the nurse left he turned to Sam, ""Sam, how do you not get scared for your family?"" Hans wasn't crazy. He fully knew Sam couldn't talk, but it was a nice nostalgia from when he first received his stuffed friend. Many of his conversations with Sam ended in great epiphanies. In his mind, he imagined the dragon replying.
""I do, I just pretend I don't.""
""How do you *pretend* you're not afraid?""
""Fear is funny. It's always there, always staring at you. You can either try to stare back, which you'll lose, or ignore it.""
""I don't think I can ignore this. The doctors and my parents are constantly reminding me.""
""You're still trying to stare back, to understand why you're afraid. Conquering fear is about building a bridge over it, not bullying your way through. Even if you make it through with brute force, others can't follow you. You build a bridge though, they can. And...if my family knows I'm afraid, they won't follow me. I have to pretend because I have to help my family.""
""I wish I could meet your family.""
""Look in a mirror, Hans. You *are* my family.""
Hans felt a wave of sadness move over him. Part of it was pity for himself, there are so many things he wanted to do, like write his own graphic novel starring Sam. Part of it was the beautiful acceptance that his life might end. The blank, white walls of the hospital provided a canvas for his imagination. He imagined his life on Jupiter with Sam's family and the others from his kind. He imagined what he would be doing had he not gotten cancer. He imagined his first beer, his first love, his first break up, and the first day of college. ""Sam, I can't…"" he paused as he tried to stifle his sobs. He couldn't actually cry, his eyes were far too dry for that from the chemo. But as a 14 year old boy, he tried to ""man"" up in his own way. “...I can't...maybe I won't be able to experience things.""
""What do you mean?""
""I mean…"" he choked a bit, ""I might not be able to have the experiences all my friends are talking about.""
""Hans, it's more about…""
""They keep talking about girls, what girl would want me? They all want the guys who play sports, skateboard, the guys who *do* things. What do I do? I sleep, lay in bed watching TV and I paint sometimes. I'm so fucking boring,"" he caught himself and checked to see if any adults were around. ""It's killing me that I can't experience life, and this is killing me too,"" he pointed to the IV in his arm.
""It's not about that, Hans. It's about what YOU experience. You're going to make it through this, and when you do you'll have an experience none of them will ever have.""
""What if I don't...what if I die next week? My friends say that heaven is a nice place, but I don't really believe them. *This* is already a nice place.""
""The hospital?""
""No, this world. There's so much to it...and I may never see it.""
Hans left his mind for the remainder of his time in the hospital. He'd rather stay there in quiet meditation, holding onto Sam as if he were drowning and the dragon was a life preserver. Hans would never recover from his illness. The tumor continued to grow and the increasing chemo rounds weakened his body beyond repair. Each time, Sam was by his side; and, each time, Hans grew weaker and weaker until he was unable to hold Sam anymore. His parents would place Sam at his side for him. As he became more fatigued, he stopped having his mental dialogues with Sam. He could see Sam was dispirited by his lack of communication, but knew he understood. Hans left his world three weeks from his last conversation with Sam - he never had a girlfriend, went to a high school party, or had his first beer.
One of the nurses asked about Sam, when his parents came to the hospital to collect his things. She didn't want to intrude on their grieving but said there was a little girl undergoing chemo who saw Sam earlier. She hoped she wasn't asking too much, but the little girl said he gave her strength. His parents thought about it for a minute, then thought about what Hans would have done. The next day, they both drove to the hospital and delivered Sam to the nurse. Later in the week, when the little girl, Natalie, came in for her treatment. Sam was sitting in her chair and she couldn't help but smile.",0
"I looked him straight in the eyes, only a young man though he looked much older. I could see the fear in his eyes almost accepting his fate.
""I'm sorry...its just the way things are."" I said grimly.
He must have noticed my cold tone. It wasn't that I didn't care, I couldn't care. This part of the job became second nature. Part of the routine. Doctors worldwide adopted the policy at the turn of the 22nd century.
""I understand but I'm sure there is something you can do...we can just keep it between us right?"" He stuttered desperately.
I handed him a pamphlet titled ""Accepting Death"" a standard procedure for all my patients. The role of doctors changed over the years. When I was a child they were known as protectors, carers and people who would help you and make you feel better. It all changed after the Crop Wars. There is never going to be enough food to feed the masses. We can no longer take care of the sick.
""I can talk you through it after you have had a moment to clear your head."" I said calmly stepping out to give the man some space. He glanced up from the pamphlet, tears in his eyes.
""Okay. Just give me 5 minutes"" He said softly with a somewhat forced smile.
I closed the door behind me and went out the back for a cigarette. The damp humid air wouldn't keep me outside for long. Before I could inhale the last drag I heard a crash followed by the sounds of shattering glass. I immediately tossed the cigarette but into the alley and flung open the metal door to return to my office. Before I had a chance the young man pushed his way passed, his strength overpowering me, pushing me to ground.
""You aren't authorised to leave! You need to come back or I'll call the police!"" Shouted the nursed clearly distressed.
I regained my breath and stood up preparing to give chase, knowing an escaped patient would likely be the end of my career. I ran through the damp dreary alley way towards the bus stop on the corner of the street. The man, despite suffering from an illness had far more stamina than myself as he slowly gained a greater lead.
My luck turned when a passing peace officer noticed the scuffle and pulled his vehicle in front of the young man. Just like that it was over. The man was no match for the strength of a government officer. He was wrestled the ground with a boot pressed into his face.
""He one of yours?"" The the officer asked sternly.
I looked down at the man and I felt something I hadn't felt in years. Empathy. This man wasn't the tyrant government propaganda portrayed the sick as. He was somebodies brother, husband and son.
""He...is a friend of mine. We just had a little disagreement."" I lied. I couldn't let this man be imprisoned and likely tortured to save my own ass.
""We'll get your friend back inside I can't have people running around thee streets like that."" The office loosened his grip and nudged the mans limp body towards the kerb.
As the officer left the man looked up at me. ""Why did you do that? You could have ended up in jail?""
""I can help you...I can't keep living this way"" I stammered.
""Help me what? Escape?"" He replied.
""No I can help save you, we have the medicine. I know it's breaking the law but someone needs to make changes. It wasn't always this way.""
""You mean you can actually cure me? I don't have to die?"" Hope filled his eyes, his face lit up with an almost cautious joy.
""Doctors used to be healers. Believe me...there was a reason I choose this profession and it wasn't to end lives...there was once a time where we saved them"" I grabbed the mans hand and slowly walked him back to the office.
""You will have to come with me, there is no safety at the office. They will always be watching over me"" I said
I took the man into my car I knew it wasn't going to be an easy mission. But if there is going to be any change in the world, if I am going to make a difference. I have to change the world one patient at a time. And it starts today.",0
"The winding road extends before me like the body of a snake. Rain pounds the windshield, and I drive at a crawling pace lest the serpent wake and fling me from its back.
On one side of the serpent, a steep hillside, covered in shadow, brush, and trees. On the other side, a sheer cliff extending down to the ocean. Who knows what foul creatures lurk in the dark waters at the base of the cliff. The road is perilously lodged between two extremes-the trees which reach up impossibly high to tickle the feet of God, and the ocean which flows down into the depths of the earth to cool the fires of Hell.
I look over at the passenger seat. My beautiful wife sits there, the side of her face pressed to the window. She was fast asleep, lulled by the sound of the rain and the hum of the tires on the wet pavement. I sigh. I am bitter.
We are returning home from her parents' place. A dry roast dinner had been a poor distraction from the equally dry conversation. But, there at the chipped yellow Formica table, under flickering florescent lights, my wife, my 'beautiful' wife, had confessed to everything. I wish she hadn't.
Affairs. Drug use. Theft, to support both her habits and her boyfriends'. She talked for what seemed like hours about her sins, though it was only minutes. I know, now, that while she might have her head turned to the hillside that reaches up, she is forever suspended over the cold, watery precipice. I realize that I've picked up speed.
I jerk the steering wheel. Not enough to cause an accident or to wake her. Just enough to prove to myself I could. I reach over and shake her awake. She looks at me, not speaking, only lifting that questioning brow of hers. I jerk the wheel again, and her eyes widen in panic.
I turn the wheel sharply, veering towards the cliffside. She doesn't scream, only grips the dashboard as the car tires leave the pavement. For a few wonderful moments, we are suspended in midair. Gravity has no power over us-we are flying. Angels, for the first and last time, before time resumes and we plummet towards the ocean.
The roaring of the waves growing louder, I spare a glance into the back seat. There, our child, a boy of seven, is fast asleep, his head having fallen onto his chest. I smiled.
I wanted my wife to know, but my son, if he is mine...he won't know what happens tonight.",0
"Life on the reservation was miserable. Poverty, crime and corruption ran rampant, and day-to-day life was much harder than it should be. Growing up, Steven learned about the White Man, who had come under the guise of peace and slaughtered his people, stole their land and herded them into these godforsaken hovels. Steven swore he would help his people. He spurned the guidance of his elders and their suggestion that he become an attorney or a civic leader, or an activist. Instead, Steven gravitated toward the myths and Gods of his ancestors, praying every day for a way to restore glory to the Cherokee nation.
As Steven got older, he had *visions. * In one, an eagle carried him across the ocean, dropping him in a faraway land where his people dwelled, hunting and living off the land. There were no cars, no smog, no white man. In another vision, a huge grey wolf carried him through the forest and into a reservation, but here there were only white men, and they lived as he did, stumbling through the life he had always known. The Gods had been good to him. They had given him a name, Spirit Traveler, and they gave him purpose; he knew what he must do, but how?
One day, as Steven was sitting in the smoke hut, meditating on his myths and gods, he had his most vivid vision. He stood facing the fire, the wolf and the eagle across from him on either side. The wolf growled and snarled, baring his fangs. The eagle spread his wings wide, raising his beak to the sky. A powerful voice resonated in his head.
""CHOOSE,"" it told him, ""Spirit Traveler, you must make your choice between the fearsome wolf or the powerful eagle.""
Spirit Traveler felt a deep hollowness in his chest, a great fear of the beasts before him. As he cowered back, the wolf spoke in a low rumble: ""You do not have to fear me."" The eagle replied in a piercing shriek ""You do not have to fear anything!""
He clenched his fists. What path should he take? He stepped forward, swallowing the lump in his throat. He reached out and made his choice.
The feast was underway when he opened his eyes. He saw the long tables, his proud, lithe ancestors sitting across from the pudgy white men in their ridiculous black and white costumes. His ancestors were so strong; he had never seen a native so full of confidence and power. He was overwhelmed; he could not imagine how these people could have been so easily and so thoroughly overrun by the much weaker white men.
His spirit animal whispered. ""Let's do what we came here to do.""",0
"I watched as Kevin made the small flame dance across the tabletop to the delight of everyone who watched.
""That's awesome Kev."" I said as he snuffed out the small flame. The small crowd that had gathered around to see Kevin show off his newfound power groaned with disappointment and begun discussing their own experiences.
Ever since the human race had been changed in the event, everybody developed a power by the time they were twenty-one. Some were major, some were minor, and some were useless. But everyone was regulated. Those who refused went rogue, and had to deal with the big guys.
""What did the examiners say?"" Said Stacey, sitting down at the table. As always, she had several flowers interwoven into her hair. Each one was pointed toward the window. Stacey could control plants, make them grow, make them move, some people said she was actually part plant.
""They think my powers will grow, they said to come back in a few years, as it is I can't make a flame much bigger than my hand for now!"" Kevin said, igniting a small fire ball in his hand again.
Without warning a torrent of water bounced across the table, literally bounced, before splashing over Kevin's hand and extinguishing his flame, not to mention soaking the entire table.
""Hey!"" Kevin said, looking towards the culprit.
Laughing, Brad strode towards the group and sat down with a flop, water twirling around his wrist in a constant stream. He always kept a little bit of water on his body, mostly for pranks.
""Pft. So you can light candles now, big deal. You'll probably never advance beyond that!""
""Jerk."" Said Kevin. But he was smiling. I smiled too. It was unlikely that any of my friends would be placed into duty for the Establishment, but that was fine, that way they wouldn't be hurt. Their powers were minor, so they were allowed to roam free.
Stacey turned to me suddenly, ignoring the small wrestling match that had broken out between Kevin and Brad.
""You must be excited huh Drew?""
""What do you mean?"" I said.
""Well you turn 21 next month right? You should be getting your power any day now.""
""Hey that's right!"" Said Kevin, who had Brad in a headlock. ""Any idea what it might be?""
""Oh, I guess I hadn't really thought about it."" I said, smiling.
""What!?"" said Brad, pushing Kevin away. ""How can you not think about it?""
""I dunno, I've been busy lately?""
All three of my friends looked at me like I was insane. I simply smiled. After all how could they know that I already had my powers. That my examination was falsified every year, because technically, I didn't exist. I went rogue. My power manifested itself at 16. And when the inspectors came around for my first test at 17, I killed them.
Because you see my power is different, my power comes from a darker god than theirs. With a simple touch, I can take. Take anything, take everything. Your mind, your looks, your memories, your voice, your sight, the air from your lungs, the cells in your brain, the blood from your veins, your power. I can remove them, I can keep them. So far I've remade my face three times, and I have taken the powers of those who have come to find out mine. And disposed of any who came close. I have been 20 for over 5 years, each year with a new face, new blood, new body, new cells, new powers. So far I'm bulletproof, I can teleport, and following a truly spectacular fight, I can control the weather. I don't age, but maybe this year I will. Maybe this year I stop hiding.
But first I think I'll see how strong Kevin's power gets. Fire sounds fun.",0
"The Joker was going to die now- that he knew. But not before he broke the Bat, the Bing a Ding, the Bruce, Darrrrrrling. After today, Gotham would see their beloved dark knight fall.
These were the thoughts that went through Joker's mind as the fists rained down. And he couldn't help but laugh, because, oh, it was just too funnnnny. ""AhahahaAHAHAHA- hahAHAHHA-hAHAHA!""
""IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED, JOKER,"" grunts the Bat, rage clouding his eyes. He slams his fists down onto Joker's chest, and there is an audible crack as ribs break.
Joker had gone too far this time, they both knew it. He'd attached a bomb to an unsuspecting girl scout, and made her sell cookies to Bruce. And then, after he'd sampled the cookies so obliviously, the dumb girl had tried to tell dear Master Wayne her secret, and Joker had no choice to blow her up, really. What a shame- Joker was sure there was a joke in there somewhere. Maybe about thin mints.
Then the Bat had come after Joker, and this time Joker wanted to be found. Cameras surrounded their fight- but of course the Bat had no idea.
The fists kept coming. ""NO MORE,"" the Bat moaned as dropped another punch. ""No more deaths."" He felt something quivering inside of him.
Joker spat out a tooth. ""What's wrong, Batsy? Are you feeling a little...squeamish?"" Joker grinned, and cackled.
Batman stepped off of Joker's beaten and bloodied body. He drew a gun. The gun he'd taken from the man who'd killed his parents, a gun it had taken him years to find. The gun that he'd kept for all this time, saving it for this moment- to finally end his greatest foe.
Joker grinned. Here it'd come. The cameras were rolling. ""DO IT, BATS, BABY. DO IT!""
Batman took the shot. It hit Joker square in the chest, and went perfectly through his heart.
A second later, a huge flood of diarrhea exploded into Batman's pants. The cameras- linked to social medias and news outlets- captured the dark brown stain, obviously spreading through Batman's grey suit.
The Joker laughed. ""Laxy laxatives, Batsy! So LONG!"" and breathed his last. This was the ultimate Joke- he had ruined the most valuable of moments, and the Bat was never again to be Gotham's reckoning. At least, not without some chuckles first.",0
"I could rule the world if I wanted to. Be revered by all mankind and be looked at as a God. But I will do none of this. I will not help the world nor will I harm it. I'm not interested in that anymore, I'm not really interested in anything anymore.
Many people would say I'm selfish for thinking the way I do. Being able to help the entire world, yet I do nothing. I could tell people why I think this way, but they wouldn't understand. You see I know life is meaningless, I know there's no point or moral to be had. That every action isn't worth the effort. Of course others think this way, but there's a difference between thinking you know and actually knowing. I didn't always have this mind set though. The way I think is a result of the power that was bestowed upon me. One that I did not ask for, and certainly would never want.
You see when I die, I wake up as my six year old self. You would think it would be amazing. To keep re-living your life doing everything you wished you could have done, but that's not the case. You see it takes away life's meaning. Everyone else's life has meaning, or at least it does to them, and that thought is all I wish I could have. The thought that anything I do has some value. For me everyday is like being trapped in a glass jar with the oxygen slowly running out, but it never does. I can never die no matter how much I want to.
In the beginning it was different. Life would have been exciting, it would have been enjoyable. To be able to re-live life, correct all stupid things I did, to ask the love of my life out, to work harder and make myself better than I was before. I tried to learn everything I could. From the arts to engineering I wanted to learn it all.
I would eventually know how to build quantum computers or make sustainable fusion. I would know how to make the cure to cancer and the common cold. I even learned how to create worm holes and transverse entire galaxies in mere seconds. It took a while to learn this of course, I never was the sharpest tool in the box. But when you have lived billions of years you can pretty much learn anything.
Eventually I could single handedly progress all humanity millions of years ahead of what it should have been. We would land on Mars and have a colony before the 21st century. The whole world would be run by fusion plants by the year 2005. And then there was the way to prolong life, almost infinitely. That's when I made the biggest mistake of my life, to choose willingly to never die, and so I lived for billions of years in a single life. All the way til the universe was starting to end.
We tried to stop it, we tried practically everything. We even build an entire artifices galaxy just so we could try to survive, but nothing would work. It was then that I learned the truth of life. That everything comes to an end, that life is really meaningless. I then awoke, just as always as a six year old boy in my mothers arms. I looked at her face, a face I hadn't seen in almost 30 billion years. This was when my life ended, at that moment. Although I still breath and have a heart beat, I am dead inside.",0
"No.
No, it can't be.
As my fingers begin to ache and her beautiful face begins to turn her favorite color, purple, I realize the mistake I've made.
I see it all.
Her first memory, parents smiling at her in the hospital. Meeting her little brother when he was born. Seeing her grandmother die, and seeing puppies be born. Getting hit in the head with a rock by her best friend, and crying, crying, crying. Falling in love with her upstairs neighbor at 13, and getting her heart broken at 15.
It all goes by so fast...these are just the highlights, I realize. The most important moments. The defining moments.
Meeting me at 16, hating my guts but needing my help on her Spanish homework. Me making her laugh for the first time with some cheesy bilingual joke, and then me asking for her number. Our first date, our first kiss. Our awkward makeout, both of us virgins. Us becoming not-virgins, together, quietly.
My proposal. Us choosing the date, and making plans. Her, meeting the best man for dinner to discuss suits while I stayed late at work. Him, getting her drunk and taking her home. Putting his arm around her and taking her to the bedroom. Trying to undress her. Her saying no.
*Her saying no. *
***Her saying no. ***
It can't be.
But it is.
And it's too late.",0
"We were meant to do this together. That was the only way it would work. Even though this was a challenge whole generations have never seen, we were meant to bring peace. But how could the elements of the world be divided? When the cosmic energy is split, the result can't possibly end well.
Yet we avoided the haunting idea all our lives. The nations were at war with each other. Kings, chiefs, warlords, and monks alike fell and rose in the span of bloodied decades. And while the soldiers sharpened their blades, the small folk looked towards us for salvation. But the hope in their eyes was tainted with despair. They knew, like we knew, that the avatar had returned as an abomination. A deformity. A freak. In pieces. The elements were shattered, in both the world and in the avatar.
But we tried. In our training, I grew powerful and graceful, while she grew swift and savage. I prayed and she danced. I attained wisdom and enlightenment as she attained glory and honor. With meditation, I waited. With a warrior's spirit, she grew restless. Soon, we fell apart. She told me to be merciless and abrupt when moving the earth, and to be rapid and stinging with water. I told her to focus the flame and to flow with the air. We didn't heed each other's words, and now we must pay the price.
She saw the battle torn lands as an opportunity to unite all the nations under one leader. To form a rigid society that pays homage and loyalty to the avatar itself, and no one else. Those that stood in her way were scorched or suffocated. She wielded fire and air like torture devices. My friends, my family, and my people all tasted her wrath.
I saw through the fog that clouded her judgment. As long as I matched her in power, I wouldn't let the realm fall to her. It was a one way trip. We came into this world together, and we were going out together. I shall dowse the flame and stand strong against the wind. Our deaths will welcome the new savior. Hopefully this time, it is whole.
The next avatar can save the world. I need it to be over.",0
"Arista stood frozen on the sand a safe distance from the edge of even the most ambitious wave. Her heart racing as she looked out to the ocean. She willed herself to move forward with every ounce of courage she could muster but her feet remained steadfastly planted. Her childhood friend Todd bobbed in the water motioning for her to join him. Todd and Arista spent the last week practicing for this day. The day Arista conquered her fear of drowning. Todd took Arista to a larger body of water every day and worked on overcoming her aquaphobia, starting with a kiddie pool in her back yard and finally ending up here at the beach. Todd would go in first then slowly Arista would follow until both were calm and floating in the middle. Arista hated herself for having such an idiotic fear especially considering she should be the last person on the planet with a fear of water. Todd swore to himself to accept his friend's unusual situation and do everything in his power to help her and he had picked up a few tricks along the way. He saw Arista wasn't moving forward so he did the same thing he had done every time so far, he moved deeper in the water, she knew if she wanted him to stop she would have to get in or he would just keep going he was an excellent swimmer and comfortable in deep water.
What Todd didn't notice was the rip current warning signs and suddenly he found himself being whisked away from the shore. The waves intensified and he was having difficulty staying above water. He looked back to the beach and Arista was running along the edge of the water calling for him to swim out, but he couldn't, he was gasping for air and inhaling more water than oxygen, he gave one final glance at Arista before he was submerged completely and unable to resurface.
Arista refused to stand by and watch her best friend perish. She pushed down her fear and ran as fast as her legs would carry her toward the water. Her phobia replaced with long lost instincts. Her feet splashed twice as she entered the water and she dove beneath a large wave. The second her toes and legs were submerged with the rest of her body in the salty water they shifted back to their natural state. No time to waste she used her newly restored turquois tail and large fins to thruster her forward toward the last place she had seen Todd. Her eyes adapted to the salt water and she could see further and clearer than she ever could on land. Arista spotted her friend's limp body drifting in the water. She swam toward him moving through the water faster than a torpedo. He was still alive but just barely; she reached around his chest and bolted toward the surface. Arista lifted Todd above her as they broke the water's surface. She quickly shifted back from her mermaid gills to human form and inhaled deeply then, pressing her lips to his, forced air into his lungs. In seconds he was coughing up water violently and struggling to catch his breath. Arista couldn't tread water for very long with legs so she shifted back using her tail to support her while she focused on keeping Todd's head out of the water as she carried him back to the shore.",0
"The last man on earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock at the door. He stared blankly for a moment and called out sarcastically ""who is it?"" There was no answer. He stared at the door for another moment. He stood up and slowly approached the door. In his mind he first hoped for a raven spouting never more but then it struck him that maybe someone else was alive. He timidly reached for the doorknob and turned it. Slowly and carefully he began opening the door. The door only opened an inch before it could open no more. The only thing to be heard through the crack was the sound of metal on metal as the heavy door struck the large object on the other side. He thought back to entering the room. There was a large machine next to the door. It must've fallen across the door. He slammed the door but neither the door nor the machine budged. In a panic he scanned the room. There were no windows or vents. There was no food or water. There was only a chair. The only thing anyone on earth still had was this single chair. They say even if you lose everything you still have your sanity. But at this moment the only thing anyone on earth still had was this single chair. One single chair sitting alone in a room. The last tomb to be filled by man. He sat in his chair as he tried his best to think back. He remembered something odd. Something strange about this room. He thought back. Then he remembered what it was and his mind was full of this one thing. There was a knock on the door. He stared blankly at it for a moment and called out sarcastically ""who is it?""",0
"""So that's why, Mr. President,"" I said, ""They call it 'super-sized'. It's all because Ray Kroc had a philosophical fling with Nietzche when he was younger! I mean, can you believe it?""
The president looked at me with wide eyes, his jaw hanging open.
""My goodness,"" he said, ""I did not know that, and I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't heard it from you."" He picked up his scotch and kicked back what was remaining and slammed the heavy glass down. He poured himself another and held up the bottle and shook it at me.
I nodded and he poured me one as well, a heavy pour.
""And you know,"" he said, ""That's probably how they came up with Superman too."" He dropped two chunks of ice in his drink, one chunk in mine. ""Nietzche. Chiristopher Reeve as Nietzche and all that, I betcha.""
""Actually,"" I said, ""the creator of Superman named hero that after the drycleaner he used to take his shirts to get pressed. The place was called Super Men's Super Shirts and Laundry. Made 'em famous.""
Well shit, he said, ""Isn't the world just great?""
He poked his left hand at the pocket of his trousers a few times before it found its way in and withdrew a pack of smokes. He asked me if I wanted one and I said sure and we picked up our drinks and walked over to the open French doors. He flipped me a cigarette and I lit them both.
""Shit,"" he said, ""Isn't it a pretty night?"" He looked out at the rose garden and exhaled a plume of smoke. I nodded. He looked down at his hand.
""I wish these damned things weren't so addictive,"" he said, ""Or that even if they were, they weren't bad for you."" I nodded again and took a long swig of the scotch.
""You know,"" I said, I just read a study out of MIT that found that they aren't bad for you at all...that they're kind of healthy for you.""
""No shit?"" he said.
""No shit,"" I replied. ""They found that they actually improve your lung capacity, and they put hair on your chest.""
The president took a deep drag on his cigarette and closed his eyes. I absent-mindedly scratched my chest and took another drink. He open his eyes and blew out the smoke.
""Well if this isn't nice, what is?"" he said.",0
"Colin hated life. It was dark, dreary, and any mistake or memory could be undone.
At the age of ten, Colin's parents chose to restart their lives *together*, without him. They'd decided having a child was a bad idea. So they abandoned him.
It happened a lot, parents leaving their children. Children called it 'a cosmic divorce'. There were many of them, millions. Children couldn't choose their daily options until aged eighteen. There weren't any laws regarding parents leaving their children, it didn't happen that often.
Some of those abandoned sought out their parents. Bloodlines weren't that hard to follow, not since generational life insurance policies were enacted. An underground league of blood spies searched the International Lineage Networks, finding 'lost loved ones'.
Now eighteen, Colin had received his report: his parents were high school sweethearts, just like before. It took him a couple months to track them down.
Through his sniper scope, he watched as they sat in the school's vacant football field, cooing and nuzzling, ignoring their lunch. Pop! Pop! Each of their heads exploded like balloons filled with cherry aspic.
Oh yeah, this is a day Colin will restart over and over and over and over and...

"I am the daemon that all men do seek,
Due to omnipotence that I possess.
I shall bring fortune to all lives so bleak,
With three wishes think they to them I'll bless.
A man with naught did beg for avarice,
And from his rags, gold raiments I gave him.
When his convives saw, from love came malice,
And at their hands he met a death so grim.
A girl who wanted gems once found my lamp,
So round her neck a necklace I did seep,
Refulgent jewels upon a chain were clamped,
Tight'ning around her neck when she sought sleep.
But one child who wished, for *me*, love's caress,
I gave it all: eternal happiness.",0
"""So, tell me, Edgar, why do you think you're in here."" A blonde girl of about 30 asked me, smiling so wide I could see that her nurses outfit matched her pristine white teeth.
""I'm telling you, I'm not a loony! That dog catcher took my boy!"" I yelled. I knew I shouldn't have. I knew that screaming would only serve to reinforce the belief these people had of me that I'm off my rocker. But you have to understand, I was panicked, you know what those people do to bad dogs, and Rex was the meanest of them all. If my boy was emulating him, I knew it wouldn't be long before things got bad.
""Just tell the nice man what you told me"" she told me, referring to a heavy-set man who most certainly did not look nice.
""Fine"", I conceded, ""I'm a single parent, a poor working man who couldn't possible afford a day-care, much less a nanny. Working in construction, bringing my boy to work was most definitely not an option either. I figure a boy of 10 could take care of himself for a few hours while I worked late, but I'm not the type to take risks. So, I brought a guard dog. That's Rex. No burglar's gonna risk breaking in with that behemoth shambling around the front yard.""
""Tell us about Rex""
""He never really took to anyone, and people tended not to take to him either, according to the pet store employee. He was a loud dog, and anyone who'd try to approach him would be met with a menacing 'GRRRRRR""' At this point I unsuccessfully try to mimic a growling sound, I'm sure that won me some points with Mr. Nice Man. ""However, when Rex met my boy at the shop, it seemed as though they had a sort of...affinity. So I brought the thing. It was perfect, my boy had a companion and a guardian for those long days I was working and couldn't be with him.""
""Unfortunately, it was a bit too perfect..."" I trailed off, wondering how I could have missed all the signs. Rubbing your equipment on anything you can get your hands on, well, I figured that was standard for a 10 year old. Using the toilet as a water bowl and using the litter box as a toilet, however, alarm bells should have been a' ringing.
""Is this the dog you claim to be your son?"" Nice Man had finally spoken up. It brought a tear to my eye seeing my own flesh in blood trapped in his little cage like that.
""Yeah, that's my boy. I'm begging you, please. I haven't lost it, I know my son when I see him"" At this point I was bawling. Must have been pretty pathetic, seeing a grown man crying like I was.
""Don't worry, Mr. Furz. I believe you."" The nurse said, her smile looking more menacing than reassuring at this point. Turning to the Nice Man, she whispers ""I think we have everything we need, let's get out of here. This man has gone to the dogs.""",0
"""Don't forget to ask her.""
""I won't grandmother.""
Bobby loved his grandmother very much, but was a bit puzzled by his grandmother's strange request. He thought, ""why should I ask the fortune teller directly what is the most important decision I will ever make and, specifically, what is the date when I will die.""
Bobby opened the door to the fortune teller's studio. It was a dark place with all the gaudy Gypsy touches that one would envision in a fortune teller's lair.
""Come on in, Bobby. Please have a seat. You don't mind if I call you Bobby, do you?"" Bobby thought that the fortune teller was quite deliberate in her tone so moved quickly over to the velvet chair that looked like something from a cheap romance novel. Bobby sat up forward in the comfortable chair eager for his first exchange ever with a fortune teller in his entire life.
""Bobby, how would you like your fortune to be told? Is there a question you would like me to address for you?"" She leaned somewhat into the table towards Bobby who was already sitting forward in his chair, mesmerized by this force of nature he saw before him.
""Sure, he started, ""I do have a line of thinking in mind. I would like to know,"" he hesitated for a moment, and continued, ""I would like to know what will be the most important decision I will ever make, and what will be the date of my death?"" He felt a little weird asking that last part. Seemed so melodramatic.
Bobby noticed that the fortune teller's attitude towards him changed but for a second, and then back, ""Sure, Bobby, let's do look into those things.""
The fortune teller pulled her crystal ball towards herself a bit and invited Bobby to lean even further into the table.
In a whisper the fortune teller continued, ""Bobby look into this crystal ball with me and let us seek what you wish to know. I, I see you sitting at a desk. You seem to be in deep thought, a tumbler of something sitting on your desk. Let me see.""
The fortune teller leans into the crystal ball even further.
""It is brandy. Bobby, do you see the brandy bottle on the credenza in the office? You are a handsome man, Bobby. Can you see him? The nameplate on the desk says 'Robert Bartholomew.' I guess you go by Robert now. Do you see the nameplate, Bobby?""
""Yes, I see the name plate. But I cannot see myself. Why can I not see myself?"" Even without the ability to see himself, Bobby was quite astonished that he could see the vision in the crystal ball. He always thought it was a joke played on gullible people.
""That is because you are you. Sorry I cannot fix that."" Said as the fortune teller moves on with the telling.
""You seem very sad, Bobby--I mean Robert seems very sad--I see an excess of water in his eyes and his eyes seem red as if he, you, were crying.""
At this point, Bobby and the fortune teller were both mesmerized with the scene unfolding before them. Robert backs his chair away from the desk and turns towards a large credenza. Grabs a knob. Oh! It's not a drawer, but a cabinet. And the knob didn't pull out as one would expect, but glided along some type of rail to reveal a safe.
Robert slowly twirled the dial on the safe, first to the right, then to the left, and then back to the right again. Robert grabbed the handle, pulled downward, but the safe would not open.
Robert let out an audible, ""Fuck!,"" and, while reaching towards his glasses, knocked his brandy glass off his desk. This time he didn't remark about his misfortune. Quickly he got a towel from his bathroom, dabbed up the brandy from the carpet for a moment, and said ""fuck it, what am I doing."" He throw the towel into the chair across from his desk. Picked up the glass and poured another brandy. Took a quick, long drink. Put the tumbler on the other side of his glasses and grabbed his glasses on the glide path to his handsome face.
Robert sat back down at this desk, turned around and again set to twirling the safe dial, but this time preceded by a brisk set of long, left twirls, looked like three, proceeded by the usual right twirl with a more careful stopping at the arrival point of 10, then to the left to 34, and then back to the right, but this time to the number 17.
Robert cranked the lever and this time it opened successfully. He reached into the safe, moved a folder with a good twenty centimeters of paper, when the crystal ball went blank.
We all saw what he had uncovered and was about to remove from the safe.
When Bobby looked up, the fortune teller was looking towards Bobby's eyes.
Bobby said, ""What does this mean?""
""Remember, you do not believe in all of this fortune telling stuff. Remember, it is a game fortune tellers play to swindle people out of their money.""

"The Orange Knight carried an orange flag.
Once it had been whole, but now hung tattered and listless, swinging limply with the trot of the mare. Ahead of him stretched a vast expanse of trees. Huge, scraggly behemoths that bent and twisted as if straightness offended them.
But the Orange Knight held the flag steady. Sword, armor, and pride had long since been abandoned, but the flag was still his. For as long as he was able, he would carry it aloft.
Torn though it was, the threads shone with the same luster as the day they were woven. Sharp. Radiant. Orange incarnate.
There was a time that the Knight had shone with by that same hue. A time of honor and regard—of laughter, carousing, and dance—but now he was Orange only in name.
As he rode he could feel the darkness rippling across his back, growing, ever growing, to consume him. He knew, but did not despair. For that Black would never reach the flag he carried. He might fall, here in this nameless land, but his flag would carry on.
He knew that someday, someone, would happen upon his bones. And inevitably they would approach. Terrified, but too entranced to leave it be. They would lift it aloft and shiver as they ran their fingers through the soft, singing tread. Just as he had so many years ago.
Then Orange would begin anew.",0
"""We could have done something Lisa!"" I kicked a piece of the rubble small enough to go flying. It was always like this; there was always some random reason for us to run off to a place, only to arrive seconds after a disaster. For the first time, we were there as it happened.
The truck driver swerved to avoid the old lady crossing the street; she got hit anyway.
The truck rammed into the pizza joint, probably killing a few inside as it did. At this point I try to go inside and help, we need to get people out of there if we want to have any chance of saving them.
Lisa slammed the car into reverse and peeled us over to a side street, just as I saw the flames flicker on the side of Ford F-150.
Seconds later, an explosion ripped through the air, and the screaming started. Lisa looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""Grab the camera.""
It was half an hour after the event, the police had arrived, the building was being checked over for a survivor, maybe two. I couldn't hold myself up, I had spent the past thirty minutes being the first person to report on the story by almost an entire 15 minutes. Get the shots before the police even arrived. It was the kind of shit that won you both ratings and awards, but I could barely stand.
Lisa didn't seem bothered by any of this, she always seemed to know exactly what to do at any given time, she acted surprised when we threw her a surprise party, she knew every answer to game shows, she would sing songs that I'd hear on the radio for the first time two weeks later.
I had put two and two together a long time ago. Lisa was able to see the future in some way. It's why we were always the first on the scene, and why she was always calling the shots on where we went.
""Yeah, we probably could have done something."" Lisa shrugged and took a sip of the bottled water we kept in the back of the van, ""might have died for it though.""
""Could we have stopped it?""
""What?""
""Let's say we keep the old woman from crossing the street, do we stop the accident?""
""Don't ask stupid questions.""
""It's a hypothetical.""
""We would have needed to arrive six minutes earlier or something,"" she responded, nonchalantly throwing out the exact figure, she shrugged and took another gulp of the water, ""not that we could have known that anyways.""
""Yeah, sure.""
**_____________________________________________________________
**
Lisa walked over to my desk once again; I looked up from the blog that I was typing out and gave her the typical 'what's up' eyebrow raise.
""Can we talk for a few minutes, Jeff?""
""Yeah, no problem, you don't mind getting this feature up a few minutes later than I was gonna?""
""You can work while we talk.""
I nodded to her and turned back to my MacBook as she propped herself on the desk beside it, ""So, are you doing alright? You've been quiet recently.""
""No big deal."" I kept typing out the closing comments of the article, nothing flashy, just an overview of what was coming up in the next election.
""Bothered by the accidents that have been happening recently?""
""Nah, we always seem to be around them,"" I lied through my teeth.
""You're lying.""
""Yes.""
""Why are you lying to me?""
""I don't want to talk about it.""
""But you're going to.""
""How would you know?"" I began looking over the last few paragraphs for mistakes.
""You know exactly why.""
I stopped running over the article and turned my attention to the woman beside me, she didn't seem troubled, she didn't seem like she was confused, it didn't seem to faze her that I was in on her little secret. Of course, it wouldn't, she knew, ""You can see the future.""
""You confront me about this in a week if I don't bring this up now.""
I close the laptop, the story can wait, ""So you know what can happen in any situation.""
""I know what happens when I take the path that I want to, and what happens if I just let everything run itself.""
""So you can change things.""
""Yes.""
""And you choose to report all these stories, rather than trying to save everyone.""
""It's not my job to play God.""
""It's your job to be human!""
""I'm a journalist before I'm a hero. I haven't been able to do this forever, and I don't want to test how often I'm right when I try to change things.""
""Fuck you."" I spat, shoving my laptop into my bag and standing. She moved to stop me, and I push her down, ""Consider this my two weeks notice.""
""Jeff..."" she trailed off.
""Wait, that's why you hired the new guy last week, you knew this would happen.""
She nodded. I stormed out.

*I need to talk to you, coffee shop in twenty. *
The text was from a number I didn't have saved in my phone anymore, but I knew it by heart from having to dial it in a panic. It was the reason that I was known as one of the best cameramen in the business. There hadn't been a lack of job offers from news stations, but I was out of the news business now. Documentaries, working with a group of old friends from film school while I tried to find funding for one about people with supernatural abilities.
She walked into the coffee shop two minutes late, wearing a yellow sundress and sunglasses big enough to cover half her face. She had taken to dressing more towards her looks recently. I still saw her online, and on the television. I waved to her, but she was already walking over to the table while looking at her phone.
""You didn't specify a coffee shop,"" I mentioned as she sat down.
""I don't need to, I know which one you're going to go to, remember?""
""Why are you here, Lisa?"" I tried to bring it right to business, but she didn't seem to be having it.
""You look good.""
""I've been doing easier work.""
""Bags under your eyes are gone.""
""Yours are still there.""
She smiled at that comment, ""At least you still have your sharp tongue.""
""Why are we here.""
She sighed as if she didn't know that I was going to be a pain about this, ""See the woman on the right?""
""Yeah,"" I say while turning to look at her.
""She spills her coffee in four seconds."" Four seconds later she does.
""What are you trying to show me?""
""Want to know what happens if I had helped her?""
""Sure.""
""She doesn't go home to change now. Instead she goes home at the end of the day and ends up getting in an accident.""
""So?""
""So I helped her there, didn't I?""
""No.""
""I can't control every freak accident, so much happens that I don't know what's going to happen half the time. When I change the path everything gets fuzzy for a second, and it's terrifying."" She looked down at the table, where the coffee she didn't have would have been, ""Sorry, it's just nice to have someone to talk to about it.""
""You should help people.""
""You should come home with me and we can make this a date.""
I paused, there wasn't anything in the conversation that lead to this point that would point to that outcome, but then an idea hit me, ""What do I say after you argue with me for ten minutes?""
""Sure.""
Even though we didn't spend ten minutes arguing, I decided that she was right.",0
"I look at my file once more. My name is Lee Harvey Oswald. 24, single, caucasian, killer. Target: John F. Kennedy. Date of Assassination: November 22nd, 1963. What have I gotten myself into, I silently think to myself. CIA will be fun they said. Black Ops gets paid more, they told me. I see why now. I leave in three hours. I anxiously pace around my small apartment room.The plan is simple. Anyone one could do it. Hide in some building, that's where it will start me off. Wait for the target to be in range, and take the shot. Simple enough. But that's not what has me worried. It's the simple fact that this whole thing is going on at all. What history is real? What history did we make. I've been assured no matter what decisions I make, the outcome is the same, I just have to be the catalyst. It always need a catalyst. But then how is it he has already been killed according to history. Well, the all-knowing scientists tell me that they detected that some events in history are triggered by the travelers of the future. So either I will be the killer, the killer actually existed, or someone is already there creating mishap and I have to somehow direct it.
It's all really confusing.",0

"""You look nervous,"" he said to me, eyes shifting to a warm yellow-orange of concern. ""Your first time in here?""
""I'm not nervous,"" I replied, honestly, picking up the next one in the line. ""I've got a thing with my eyes. They're always this color.""
""You sure?"" the salesman said, eyes turning the white of confusion with a few flecks of red anger dashed here and there. ""I mean, I get it, but you don't gotta make stuff up.""

"**The Huntsman** got a lot of ink right off the bat. He hit newspapers. He got airtime. Speculation on the net & on the street. It was hard to ignore. It's not often someone gets a crossbow bolt to the heart or head while down in the city. It's not often that 15 people a month get one either, but that's the city we live in now. A crack dealer by the city capitol, a pedophile in Bablet Park, a homeless drunk in the middle of an intersection, a prostitute by the docks, a wife-beater on his front doorstep, a pimp by the Black River, a trucker in the bathroom of a diner, an investment banker in his corner office, a frat boy behind a bar, an elementary school teacher on the playground, a priest at St. Timothy's, the mayor's aide in a car full of cash from the projects, a cop in his car on the side of the highway, the 1^st reporter on the scene of the cop's murder, & a man in camouflage in front of a crowd. It was a poor way to begin the year.
Up until Father Emmery was murdered in his confessional, there wasn't even an extra detective assigned to the city's investigation. Then came the public outcry. Half the city went to the streets in protest of the murders. Half the city went to the streets in support. There had always been murmurs among his parishioners. It took only 3 days from the night of the Father's murder for violence to break out. Camouflage became the uniform of his supporters & acolytes, though no one had yet seen the killer or how he dressed. St. Timothy's chapel & schoolhouse was burned down by a midnight mob in camouflage & the responding firemen were assaulted. By the time the PD arrived, the firemen were already hacked to bits with their own axes. Since the axes were thrown into the burning church, the police had no evidence to charge anyone. Mayor Conti granted amnesty & called for a citywide curfew, but his word held less sway 4 days later when his primary aide was found smuggling garbage bags of cash from the projects with a bolt through his neck.
That was the day things started to change. Police refused to enforce the curfew. The city government shut down, maintaining only utilities & police. Tourism dried up. Businesses closed their doors. Armed groups of camouflaged men patrolled the streets. The image of a bow & arrow could be found spray-painted on any government buildings, churches, schools, banks, & police stations; many times accompanied by the words *"" The Hunt is on. ""* Few people went out alone on those nights. Thousands of people left our city forever.
However, that didn't stop steel bolts from flying true & reaching their targets. It only worsened when lead investigators of the killer's serial murders released case-sensitive information: *The Huntsman*'s bolts were engraved with the crimes of each victim. Selling Poison. Pedophilia. Addiction & Sloth. Spreading Disease. Brutality. Sex Slavery. Serial Murder. Theft & Laundering. Serial Rape. Pedophilia & Child Abuse. Pedophilia, Embezzlement, & Murder. Corruption & Laundering. There would be more to come by January's end.
It was hoped that by releasing this information, the citizenry might better identify *The Huntsman*, or at least avoid angering him & the subsequent bolt to the eye. What it truly did was give the camouflaged followers a guideline & ethos to follow & bind them together in their cause. They called themselves Acolytes of Orion. They began spray-painting the constellation of Orion on streets they felt they had claimed from their prey. They gathered & prayed to him in the burnt ruins of St. Timothy's. There, they awaited instructions from their silent prophet. They awaited a bolt falling from the stars to direct their path.
When Officer Kyler was found in his car on the side of the highway with a bolt through his badge & heart which read ""Corruption & Brutality,"" a 27 year old reporter, Natalie Greyson, showed up at the scene first. On air, broadcasting live, Natalie approached the front of the vehicle & turned back toward the camera. It was at that moment that a bolt flew through her skull & pinned her body to the back door of Officer Kyler's cruiser. The bolt read ""Lying & Sensationalism."" The whole city saw it happen.
The media died down. Crime rates fell as well. In turn, the police went on a soft-strike, only enforcing laws regarding violent crime & theft, focusing on *The Huntsman*. He didn't seem to mind, or at least didn't want a war. Law Enforcement was as scared as anyone. Whereas the murder of Mayor Conti's aide was viewed as cleaning up the government, Officer Kyler's death was considered a near declaration of war. We all felt the effects. We were all caught in The Hunt with no end in sight. No way out of the Hunting Ground.
From the dawn of New Year's Day we knew of *The Huntsman, * but not why he hunted. He gave no statements, released no manifesto, left no warnings, took no trophies, had no links between his prey, & he made no evidence of approval or disdain for his Acolytes. January 31^st fixed that. It only brought more turmoil. *The Huntsman*'s 15^th kill was one of his Acolytes. It started innocently enough when a lone Acolyte of Orion prevented a mugging, but he kept beating the assailant. The screams could be heard 3 blocks away. Those in the high-rise apartments surrounding him called the police who failed to respond, hoping to avoid a clash & backlash from the cult. The police & the Acolytes of Orion had been eyeing each other since The Razing of St. Timothy's. The tension pierced the hearts & minds of every citizen as they slept each night. We were waiting for a battle. *The Huntsman* spared us that. While all eyes on the block focused on the street below, he struck from above in the high-ground. As citizens exited their homes to surround the Acolyte, he was already stalking his prey. A bolt fell from the sky & drove itself through the back of the camouflaged man. He plunged sharply to the concrete on top of the writhing mugger. As all eyes rose to the rooftops, a man in his late thirties approached the corpse & drew the bolt from it. He wiped it on his jeans to remove the blood & reveal the engraving. He read the crime aloud: ""Vigilantism."" The family men & blue collar workers surrounding the fallen Acolyte looked at each other silently beneath the glow of streetlights, beneath the watchful eyes & judgment of *The Huntsman. * They watched each other wordlessly & helped the mugger to his feet. He was driven to the hospital. Those men learned what we all would the next morning, on the 1^st of February. There is only one *Huntsman. *
We were spared that war.
The understanding was that the city remained *his* Hunting Ground.
No one else's.
There was a certain comfort in that. People took back to the streets. Law Enforcement Officials resumed their patrols of previously claimed roads & neighborhoods. The Acolytes of Orion continued parolling, cautiously asserting their presence. They weren't cautious enough. No matter what they did, they couldn't have been careful enough. It was bound to happen eventually. Someone just had to get angry enough. As angry as *The Huntsman* must have been. Someone just wanted their home back. Their life back. Some normalcy. Perhaps he just didn't like his city being claimed by a stranger. Whatever the case, we all suffered for it.
**The Hangman** made his presence known on the Ides of March. The date was a message all of its own. There could only be one recipient intended. Four Acolytes were found hung by the neck with their bowstrings from four stoplights. The whole intersection's yellow & green lights had been shot out & broken, leaving only red.
Another clear message: Stop.",0
"Not in second person, but here it is:
Hours had gone by before she dared to look back. The blisters on her blue feet were collecting small stones and filth as she scurried across the desert floor.
""What have I done?"" she thought. She had left behind everything she had known, including her responsibilities as a mother.
""Coward"" she cursed. ""Coward!"" She would have cried if she were not so afraid, ears ringing from the gunshots.
*Ruff ruff*
Those must be the dogs, she thought. They were only puppies when she first came to the house, and now here they were coming for her. She knew how fast they were, and she knew it was only a matter of time.
*Ruff ruff*
""Coward!"" she continued to scream, the image of her crying children intoxicating her tortured mind. They'll be forced to watch her as she is being punished, as she dies.
She asked herself if it was worth it.
He was laying on the floor when she had left, covered in his own blood, killed by his own gun. She remembered how he groped her every night, and the nauseating smell of his sex as he forced himself on her. She had never tasted the cruelty of Allah's soldiers before she had met him. She did not know that great men could be exempted from the Holy rules.
*Ruff ruff*
The dogs were getting closer now. Her pace slowed as the pain from her raw feet began to sink its teeth in her, forcing her to stop and collapse to her knees. The tears had finally began to surface to her brown eyes as the anger faded, distorting the already obscure landscape in front of her. She looked up to the dark sky, capturing the swindles of lights that filled her watery eyelids. She closed her eyes.
God is watching me, she thought to herself, and God will punish me.
She heard the roar of his holy engine beginning to engulf her ears as he prepared to smite his sinful subject. She felt his breath grow more ferocious as the sands around her swirled. Her hand trembled as she felt his presence approach her.
She opened her eyes again, looking up into the starry sky to face her judge and creator, his glorious light blinding her sight. She shielded her eyes to capture a proper glimpse of this soaring black bird that engulfed her in Allah's light, her body shaking ferociously in awe.
Finally the tears from her eyes dried, and she caught the image of Allah's black wing. It bore the symbols: Δ6.",0
"Pressing his hand against the ancient stump as he'd done so long ago, the man's weathered hands pushed away moss and growth away from the oak. With a weathered tone, he read from the old words written long before the time of his grandparents as he did so long ago.
When she appeared to him again out of the fog of the forest, it was as if she hadn't aged a day, with the same golden hair he remembered from that day in his youth and pearl-colored skin as smooth as a newborn's, her robes made of the finest silks and woven as a tapestry of gold and jewels.
Grasping his love for the last time, the man expired with a smile on his face, and the two vanished into the fog forevermore.",0
"**This was a great prompt, but I kind of took it in a different direction**
It started with one long slow note,
Was apprehensive at the start,
With confidence the note grew bolder,
Adding harmonies to its heart,
As song took shape more voices joined,
‘ Till the village was filled with song,
And I alone ignored its pleading,
I had no voice to sing along,
I looked down on the songs and dancing,
My lip curled with righteous scorn,
""What childishness this frivolous drear,
Too carefree for one wellborn,""
As hours passed the song had changed,
For with each precious moment,
A fresh new song had been arranged,
Thus began my painful torment,
For I alone could hear no song,
Nor the cadence in the dance,
Nor the words with which the village crooned,
To lovers locked in their romance,
A different song for love or weeping,
For ending conflicts long hard-fought,
Though animals with growls and peeping,
Could hear the Song, I alone could not,
I begged my ears to hear the sound,
My voice to produce a single note,
Yet heard no Song and no note found,
The lines I was unable to quote,
Desperate now with tears and pleading,
Arms stretched skyward, knees shorn and bleeding,
""From whence came these tragic proceedings,
That I alone, of upright breeding,
Should falter at the call?""
And yet no answer to my anguished cry,
I bid a deaf singing town good-bye,
The tallest mountain to catch my eye,
I climbed ‘ till I was weak with panting,
""What life is this?"" My mind obsessed,
""That I alone should be music-less,
The dancing feats others posses,
Should stop short when it reaches me?""
Though two days passed, uncomprehended,
My food ran out, my journey ended,
I slowly stood up, and then descended,
To return to the start of my misery,
My footsteps slow, my eyes unseeing,
For deep within in all my being,
I knew that I was alone.
The dreaded sound heard over the hill,
Every footstep a challenge of will,
*But as I drew nearer the sound was, different, *
Not playful as it was when I'd departed,
Nor cheerful, or melodious at all,
Instead the song was full of anguish,
It sounded nothing like what I recalled,
I ran until my heart was bursting,
The sight of my town set me to cursing,
My friends in rags yet still rehearsing,
Spurred on by some devilish call,
Though exhausted the people noticed,
When I ran in through the main gate,
Their eyes looked up, expressions hopeful,
That I would save them from this fate,
For in my absence they had learned,
That not a one occurrence could pass,
Without a jig, or dancing circle,
Without a chorus to sing en masse,
All this they sang beseechingly
""And so it is,"" They sang to me,
""One such as you could say and be,
Instead of us, then we'd be free""
Hopelessly I watched them wander,
Their choreographed dances and trills,
And one by one they joined the yonder,
Till I was alone on the hill,
My bitterness had reached crescendo,
As I watched the last one drift away,
Why should they be graced easy passing,
While I alone was forced to stay?",0
"""Yes, I'd like to set up a savings account for my daughter here."" George, formerly Dr. Sinister, said to the teller.
""Okay, sir, not a problem at all. I'll just need you to fill out these forms here, and-"" the teller paused.
""What is it?"" George asked
""Sir, do not make any sudden movements, turn around slowly,"" the teller said
George and his daughter Sally obeyed and were shocked to see two men and a woman at the entrance of the bank pointing guns at them.
""Calm down, people,"" the man on the left said, ""You're all gonna be fine if you do what we say. Line up on the side of the room and take out your wallets. Duploid, hit the vault.""
""On it."" the other man replied as he walked towards the quivering teller. George stuck his foot out as Duploid walked by, tripping him. He and the hostages had a simultaneous gasp and laugh.
""What the hell? You got a death wish or something, old man?"" Duploid said.
""No, but you may want to wish for a new villain name. You sound like some french brand of soap or Chinese food.""
""What's it to you what his name is? You're getting robbed, I wouldn't be one to criticize,"" the woman said as she walked over, toting her MP5.
""I've had past experience in your line of work, and I was never so sloppy or outgoing. You'll all be rotting in a jail cell in two months if you aren't already dead."" George coldly replied
The woman villain known as Miss Taek grew frustrated and pointed her gun directly at George.
""You can quit talking and hand over your wallet or I can spray your guts all over your daughter. Make up your mind."" Miss Taek said.
""I am fifty-three years old, my daughter's inheritance is secured, my wife is a beautiful woman and an excellent caretaker. I live in a fantastic house that I bought with money I earned after turning away from crime. I couldn't give a shit if you hurt me right now.""
""Swear jar, daddy,"" Sally peeped.
""Well, if you don't care about dying, what about your daughter?"" Miss Taek said as she pointed the gun at Sally.
George remained calm. ""Cover your eyes, sweetheart. You know the difference between me 30 years ago and you right now, Miss Taek? I actually had powers. Can you guess? No? I could control people's MINDS"" and with the last word, he made Miss Taek suddenly jerk her arm over and blow Duploid's brains out onto the teller and the counter.
The other robber attempted to drop his gun and run out the entrance after seeing what happened, but George made him have a seizure and run into the wall, breaking his neck.
""You've made a grave mistake, Miss Taek. Tell me, how long can you hold your breath? Because you know, normally, after a certain amount of time, you breathe automatically on reflex. Where does that reflex to breathe come from? Your brain of course. You know what'd be fun? Let's see how long you can last when you forget how to breathe.""",0
"Something had caught his eye. A beauty, standing next to a sandy-haired young man. It was gorgeous. Smart too, it would appear. Of course, It had nothing on him, but honestly who did?
Now he wouldn't want you to think he considers himself some kind of avenging angel. He doesn't do what he does out of any kind of desire for intellectual cleansing. He does it simply because, well why not? A question he likes to pose to each of his toys before he completes his cycle. See, hunt, tease, terminate. Fortunately for him, none have answered his question sufficiently to break the cycle. Clearly none were on their high school debate teams, or they'd know that begging really isn't all that persuasive.
He's made a note in the past that none seem to enjoy the teasing. A shame, since it's definitely his favourite part. That stage also tends to correlate to the change from well-reasoned arguments to tearful begging. He often almost feels sad at the loss of an even slightly worthy opponent. Almost. He flashes back to his favourite so far. There was one that never begged. No. Instead it just stared, spitting biting retorts to every question he asked it. He'd had to work hard to make that one sing like the others. He shook his head. He had more important things to focus on.
The hunt is most certainly enjoyable too, make no mistake. He likes to observe them living their daily lives, watch them completing their little rituals. Little do they know that they've just become a part of his.
Yes, he's certain he's going to like this new one. So he makes the decision to move to stage 2. Stage 2 involves the preparation. He approaches his local hardware store for the necessary equipment. He smiles as he remembers how well-trained he has the employee's here. They all seem cemented in the belief that he is simply a rather awkward local with a passionate love for DIY.
He wanders round the store picking up the usual. He smiles indulgently at his own behaviour, much like a trainer might at an eager pet. He really is soft-hearted. The way he buys a completely new set of rope, tape, waterproof canvas, a kind of welcome gift for each new toy. Almost a thank you for **their** gift. His purchases had seemed suspicious at first, but a few well-placed stutters and the occasional glances from their eyes to the floor built up the image he needed for them to see.
""Hello there! Anything I can help you with today?"" He grunts in annoyance at the sudden interruption by this unknown voice. And his routine had been going so well. They knew better than to approach him. Without even looking up, he growls out a ""No."" before fully turning his back on the worker to search for the disposable gloves. He's almost out, and he does so hate creating a mess.
A voice follows him as he goes, ""Well you just let me know if that changes!"" He grunts again, nodding over his shoulder. He catches a glimpse of a vague middling height youth and a flash of brown hair before continuing on. He hadn't realised they were hiring.
---
He yawns. ‘ Time to take a break ’, he thinks. He has after all been sitting outside Its office window for the past 3 hours. It certainly works late. He smiles. He does like a hard worker. They tend to be so much more fun. His favourite had been working hard through the night towards some kind of typical academic accolade. He was glad he'd never gotten trapped in the typical rat race his toys lived in. He preferred more substantial victories. His toys should really be grateful for freeing them from their caged little lives.
He wandered over to his local coffee shop. They knew his order and often had it sitting on the counter by the time he'd reached it, steaming and heavily caffeinated. Only he didn't recognise the person standing by the almost obscenely shiny and over-complicated nectar-giving machine today. He sighed, preparing himself for another mundane interaction.
The youth looked up from the cup he was holding and smiled widely as he approached. He was taken aback by the fervour with which this man must enjoy making coffee.
""A triple shot espresso. A drop of milk."" He had the change in hand, ready for exchange. No need to make this more complicated than necessary. It seemed the youth didn't agree.
""You sure you want all that caffeine so late at night? It'll be hours before you get to sleep!"" he said whilst gesturing at the clock.
He grunted. It was like even this guys actions were followed by exclamation marks.
""Well okay then! It's your last meal!""
He furrowed his eyebrows. Wasn't the expression, ‘ your funeral ’. Whatever. He just wanted the drink so he could go home and plan for tomorrow. The thought buoyed him up, to the point where he even managed a smile as he accepted the cup from the frankly over-zealous youth.
He turned towards the door. A ""Have a good night! Be seeing you soon!"" followed him out.
---
He awoke groggy. He soon noticed the searing pain in both shoulders, followed by a chipper voice saying ""You changed your mind then? Or can I still not help you with anything?""
He struggled, soon realising the precarious position he was in. He appeared to be suspended on a hook, his bound wrists holding him up as his toes brushed the ground.
He rasped out, ""What's going on? Where am I?""
He looked up, and met the eyes of...wait. Wasn't that the irritatingly chipper youth from the coffee shop? He still appeared to be as joyful as ever. And that voice, much like the new worker from the hardware store?
""Didn't I say we'd be seeing each other soon?""
He closed his eyes. This must be a dream. Yes, some kind of switched perspective. What else could it be?
That burningly happy voice cut through his thoughts. ""Do you even know my name? I don't wear the name tag as an accessory you know!""
His eyes opened almost of their own accord and zoomed in on the tag. ‘ Greg ’. For some reason he was almost disappointed at his psyche for not thinking up something more exciting. Like he'd be taken down by a ‘ Greg ’.
""And finally, he acknowledges me! You've never been one for names have you? I'm almost certain you never bother learning theirs before you play your little game now do you? Not worth your time I imagine.""
Now he's really paying attention. It's finally caught his notice that this doesn't have any of the signatures of a dream. But why would anyone kidnap **him**? That's simply not how this works!
Greg spoke again, ""You don't know her name do you? The girl you've been staring at all night?""
Adrenaline was coursing through him. He needed out. He was sure he could persuade this guy to let him go. No coffee shop worker could match him in wits. He just needed a plan…
""You still don't get it do you? What this is all about? This is about him. The boy that I LOVED. That you killed. And for what? Hmm? He was about to get his masters, WE were about to move in together!""
One thought filled his mind. ‘ Oh shit.'This might be a little tougher than he'd hoped. He was sweating now, his shirt was sticking to his back. He didn't deserve this! This heart-pounding terror! What had he ever done?
""But I'm going to give you a chance. I'm going to give you a chance to get out of this scott free. Answer my question and I'll let you go. I'll walk away.""
He imagined the relief he was exuding was palpable. He was sure he'd master whatever question this youth could possibly ask him. How hard could it be?
Out if Greg's mouth came the words, ""What was his name?""
Silence reigned. His ears were filled only with the sound of his pounding heart. He didn't know how long had passed. His mouth hung open but no sound could be forced into emerging. Desperation washed over him as the minutes passed.
Finally, the impasse was broken, as Greg smiled. A manic smile, one that finally seemed to reach his eyes.
""Well don't worry. You'll know it soon. I'll pull it screaming from your lips. It'll be the last thing you ever hear.""
And he thought, ‘ Oh SHIT. ’
That was his last coherent thought for a while.

"The boulder tumbled mercilessly down the steep slope, and after he lost sight of it he heard it, crashing against the ledge at the bottom of the mountain.
He dropped to his knees, too exhausted to put the scream that was in his heart out into the world. Every part of his body ached. His broad muscles were impressive, but were not built for the task at hand. No human was built for such a task. And although the wretched man had always known that, it had never stopped him from trying it again. The only way out of this hell was to play the game; the boulder at the top of this mountain became his light at the end of the tunnel.
He started his way down the hill, his calloused feet carrying him down the rough terrain. He could barely remember the life that existed before this one. Was he a king? Was he a slave? All images of the past were replaced by ones of the mountain. The gods had forsaken him to this pointless task, erasing every part of him that existed before and replacing it with this image, this blood metronome. Every roll of the rock was another strike of a massive clock that counted down the minutes to nothing, and served only as a tool that others could look towards as example.
After hours of excruciating labor, Sysiphus moved the rock to the top of the mountain. The boulder tumbled mercilessly down the steep slope, and after he lost sight of it he heard it, crashing against the ledge at the bottom of the mountain.",0
"There are a lot of poems for this, so I decided more of a soliloquy.
I remember the rain, I don't know why but I always remember the rain.
I remember the morning after the bombs, the rain falling on the streets and the shattered buildings. Tip tapping on the helmets of the wardens and the firemen, the only noise in the silent, stunned streets, turned from our childhood playgrounds to ruined killing fields. It washed away the blood into the drains, and washed the dust of our faces as we emerged blinking from the shelter. So happy just to feel the cold sting on our numb skin. So happy to have survived another night.
I remember the rain the day I met you. I'd never smelt rain like it, to a city girl, rain was sour and dusty, sticky tears of a skyline ruined by the factories of war. This rain was fresh and pure, splashing into the muddied fields that stretched further than I could imagine. Your family sheltered me, from the rains, of water and bombs. How could we not be together, hiding under the bed, hearing the planes overhead, to rain on the cities and the factories.
Did we have children? I am sure we must have. You must have had a job, and I was the house wife, we lived.. somewhere. I just don't know anymore. I remember the rains.
I remember the rain the day we said goodbye. I'm not sure when it was, or who was there, but I remember the rain. Drumming on the roof as someone, someone important, spoke about you. I remembered you then. I remember loving you. The rain should have stopped as you slid through the curtain. Each drop should have shown its respect!
As the smoke rose from the chimney, the rain carried on, you drifted up to join it, you became part of it. I remember you.
I remember the rain.
I just wish I could remember you name. Your face. Your smell.
It's raining today, I can see it out the window. I try to tell the plump lady who's been hovering by the bed looking sad and sullen, I wish she; d leave me alone to be honest but, any company will do. ""Look"" I say, pointing out the window. ""Look there he is, I remember him"". She looks out the window.
""There's no one there"" she says, and bursts into tears. I don't know why she cries so much, maybe shes got something wrong with her, she says some very peculiar things sometimes. ""Are you from the mental ward"" I ask, as nicely as I can. ""even a mental one can see, he's out there, out the window""
She sobs again, this big bubbling woman, wasting my time and energy. I wished she'd leave me alone. Leave me in peace. She must be mental, I remember what she said, over the rain on the window. She said ""There's no one there Mum"".
What a lunatic.",0
"8:15 in the morning. The slip slid under my door. I saw it out of the corner of my eye and watched it move slowly across the carpet. It was like the person delivering it didn't want to make the smallest of noises. Not even a whisper. They knew what they were doing. I watched it settle, then turned back to my breakfast. Eggs. Lots of them. I've been eating eggs every morning for 26 years. I've eaten eggs in Kentucky, in Alabama, in Ohio. I've done them every way I can think of. They've long since stopped being anything more than part of the routine. Breakfast, workout, shower, costume, show, cry, sleep.
People get old. I saw it growing up. I'd look at people I knew. 10 years later they were past it. But I never realised it would happen to me. And the cruellest thing is it really creeps up on you. One day you're young. The next, how did that happen?
My life is simple and I've found joy in the little victories where I can. My costume is the same size it was when I joined the show. I pat myself on the back each time I fit into it. I can still stir the crowd, on a good night. The kids especially with their unrestrained joy and bright futures. And I lift the same weights. Kind of. Mr Barnes doesn't know I know he's messing with the plates. Most of them are clay rather than steel, but it's always been more about showmanship anyway, right? And the little car I lift each night, well that's basically a hollowed out shell.
I guess they must pity me. The old guy too proud to throw in the towel himself. The looks you see are hard to ignore. The 90% smiles. The half-hearted cheers. It hurts and it's the same each night no matter which state we're sitting in.
The eggs just don't taste right this morning and my eyes wander back to the slip under the door. I can imagine what it says. My time is up. 26 years of eating eggs and lifting cars and it comes down to a crumpled piece of paper delivered by a faceless messenger. Am I not worth more than that?
You see it's hard to tackle the things you've got no control over. I can push hard in the gym and get the sleep and food I need to power my body but the body is still 56 years old. How many more times round the clock will it go? And what will I do when it finally fails? Maybe I am too proud to let them see me like that. Finally broken by a plastic car and fake barbells. The shame.
The small caravan feels quite cramped now. There's not enough air. The smell of the half eaten eggs, the gas cooker and week old laundry are getting caught in my throat. But really it's the note under the door that's making me feel nauseous. A career of making people laugh and cheer and they do me like this. I can't face it.
The overheard cupboard opens and I take out the Colt. It's cold and heavy and dull. Immediately I feel the same stupid feeling I've always felt when I look at the piece. The weakness. It's one of the few things I never been able to lift. But maybe that slip of paper will make things different this morning.",0
"The envelope was heavy. Very heavy, especially considering that it doesn't cost too much to get a favorable review. Ron cut it open, and tipped out 100 dollar bills, and a bunch of pennies, taped together flat. They didn't jingle, they hit the table with a thud as hollow as Ron's promises.
He opened his laptop, and fired up a word document. He tried to start writing something, but it was all the kind of lies that made his fingernails itch. Ron wasn't averse to selling a mediocre book as if it were something of quality, or postulating that the great books he read would one day replace classics on the shelves of the wise. He liked a little bit of hyperbole, flattery, a little bi of white-lie to spice up a review. It was easier to be critical of a book, which is why Ron's column was called ""High Notes,"" because he focused on the good. People liked it, people read it, and the local bookstore confirmed that he had an impact.
But he couldn't justify the garbage he had read. There was no way that Ron could convince an innocent person to open that tome, to read its words, to know the author's madness the way that he did. After three hours, two joints, and a few drinks, Ron was lubricated enough that he had a wicked idea; write positively, but make it incredibly clear that the book was awful.
""If you enjoyed Shakespeare's novels, or the brisk pace of Herman Melville's *Moby Dick*, then Scott Trifold's newest masterpiece will absolutely thrill you.
Its plot is dense like packing peanuts, and so tightly woven you'd swear it was a fishing net. The characters are well-developed like three minute wine, and their complexities make a blank piece of paper seem positively unknowable. The novel begins as many do, with something happening. Trifold, however, does not take the predictable route of either having something else happen, or explaining what's happening. Instead, he writes out the whole scene again, from the same perspective, with even more adverbs. This daring use of repetition is evident through the whole novel. Three characters named Molly appear at different points, and despite being different people, they are all described the same way, down to the spelling errors.
Trifold's disdain for the traditional rules of writing set him apart from his contemporaries, who focus on readability, or depth, but his efforts produce something much more exciting; the experience of feeling like a beginning writer. It is this critic's belief that Scott Trifold produced *The Witch's Tits* not as a novel, but as an experimental form of fiction where we see how a plot develops inside the mind of a simpleton, and it is absolutely breathtaking in how it accomplishes that. The occasional note from the fictional author to himself is heavy-handed at times, but nothing can make a sex scene- so realistic and invigorating that you'd swear it was stolen from a twelve year old's fanfic- better than a shopping list.
The book is almost certainly available for sale.

"I don't know what they are.
When you think of monsters, you imagine the familiar - werewolves, zombies, or maybe vampires. The kind of monsters you see in movies and games. It's a natural reaction. Not many people can imagine the really uncomfortable or frightening kind, nor do they want to. I certainly couldn't imagine this.
""Sweetie? You can come out now. It's safe.""
The emergency broadcast on the TV told everyone to stay put. To lock the doors and close the curtains. As always, a lot of people didn't listen, taking to the streets with guns and backpacks in tow. I don't know what happened to them. I don't even know what I hope happened to them anymore - perhaps becoming a monster is just a matter of switching sides at this point.
""Our kids are waiting downstairs. The government made another brodcast, they said the crisis is over.""
The only reason I'm still hiding is paranoia. It's not even really a fear of the unknown - I know that the person outside the closet is my wife.

""I'll wait out here, honey. Until you're ready to come out.""
She is my wife. She has to be, right? If she was a monster...I'd know, right? At the same time, I haven't heard any broadcasts on the radio. The silence outside is still ear deafening. A note slips under the door. ""I miss you"" it says.

"Captain Rick slammed on the brakes of his moon rover, and skidded to a stop for the next 10 seconds.
Once the rover stopped completely he stood up and headed over to the object glinting a few meters away from him.
As he got closer the brightness became more and more unbearable, until he managed to cover the object with his shadow.
He blanched at the sight, murmuring a soft ""What in the actual fuck..."" before hurriedly reaching for his radio button.

footsteps approached the cabin fit snugly for one person. The door shuttered, and twinged, the bolts connected to the wood, and Ann stepped forward. Before even reading their faces she bemoaned in a breathe held out of running, dropped four pieces of wood, and cussed out, ""Their coming. The rats...they were heading north...that means, well, you know who follows them.""
Jim dropped the clay cupping of his soup bowl. Lyte ran to the door, and Ann screamed this time, ""Their coming!""",0
"Audrey and I looked at each other through the reflection of the lake, and she smiled at me. The sun was setting, and the orange light reflecting off of the water made Audrey look like an Egyptian goddess. She was beautiful, but I would be lying if I said that the lack of pigment on her skin didn't bother me. She looked up from the water and swung her bare feet off of the rock we were sitting on. I looked up too, meeting her hollow eyes.
""Tell me how it feels again, Michael"" Audrey said.
""I've told you hundreds of times."" I replied as I reached my toes into the water. A chill went up my spine.
""I know, I just like hearing you talk about it.""
I couldn't help but smile. I told her everything I could about how the icy water felt. Or how the hard cold rock under my bottom was uncomfortable. And how my hair falling onto the back of my neck and bare shoulders tickled, and sometimes made me shiver.
Everytime I described these senses to her, I tried to delve into further detail, sometimes I would even make things up just to see her smile and ponder what I meant by ""itchy"" or ""tingle"".
Audrey wouldn't know for sure, of course, because Audrey is a ghost. Or at least, we think that she is. There's no way to know for sure, I guess. I guess is a phrase a use a lot given my circumstances.
Audrey and I live next to our lake, in our forest. I can still feel, but we think that we have been here for the same amount of time. I don't remember a life without Audrey, and she doesn't remember much of one without me either.
When I opened my eyes all of those years ago to silver hair flowing over my face, and the yellow mid day sun shining through the strands causing me to squint, I was afraid. The sun made her thin hair seem like strands of metal, and the first time I heard her voice I thought it was the metal strands rubbing together. Her voice is frightening, and if she could feel she would have felt my head bump into hers as I hurriedly sat up.
""Who are you?"" Was all she said.
I opened my mouth to answer, and was confused when nothing came out. Who am I?
""I...don't really know."" I managed to say, my words stumbling over each other as if I had just learned to speak. I was finding my bearings, and for some reason I didn't start to panic. I just sat there, staring at this strange girl. She couldn't have been older than 14. How old was I?
""Well how do you like the name Michael? It sticks out to me."" She said as she sat back and crossed her legs, gently laying her hands onto her knees. It was at this moment I realized she was naked, and my stomach sunk.
Looking at her almost stung my eyes, her pale skin reflected the sun better than the lake that sat twenty feet from where I had just woken up. I got angry for a second. Angry because I was confused. And just as I was about to lash out at her, a thought came into my mind. I thought that wasn't created in the last five minutes, no, something deeper than that.
""Audrey."" I whispered.
""I don't mind that! Well Michael, call me Audrey!"" Her broken record player voice screeched.
It took me a few minutes to look at her again. And a few days to be able to speak to her. It took months to respond to Michael, and it may have taken years to get used to her voice.
Now, I do not know how much time has passed, but my hair touches my neck and my bare shoulders, and all that matters is the setting sun and Audrey's pale smile. A snap of a tree branch rang out from behind us, and both of our heads turned in time to see the branch hit the ground. A tall man stood there, accompanied by a few boys.
""We finally found you."" The tall man said. I turned to look at Audrey, but she was gone.",0
"& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ardinius the Magnificent plucked at his silken robes, and fixed a neutral expression on his face. *Why did it have to be an arrowhead? * He thought, as he watched the elvish instructor demonstrate the spell he needed to learn for his quest.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; **Because he is the only one who knew the spell. Stop acting like a racist bigot and learn. **
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; *Shut. Up. * He told the voice in his head.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"" Sirrah, you seem distracted,"" said the Elvish spellmaster.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ardinius gritted his teeth, and in a tightly controlled tone, he said. ""I am fine, arr-"" He cut himself off, then continued, ""Spellmaster."" *If I didn't need this spell I'd never let this bloody arrowhead talk down to me. *
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; **He *is* your superior. **

& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; The elvish spellmaster watched the apprentice sorcerer for few moments, as his expression kept changing with his mental discussion. Ardinius might have thought his expression inscrutable, but elves were past masters of the art of reading facial expressions. ""If you won't pay attention, I will leave you to your own devices and allow you to suffer
from your folly.""
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"" You'll do no such thing you bloody arrowhead!"" He shouted aloud. He regretted it instantly as a coin back flew into his face and broke his nose.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"" We are done,"" said the spellmaster, coldly. ""I will not tolerate an ignorant, rich, little brat with an inflated notion of his self-worth, no matter how much gold he spends, or who sent him on his quest.""
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"" I'll double your fee!""
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp;"" We are done,"" the elf repeated. ""Begone."" The spellmaster raised his hand and the insolent whelp in resplendent robes was surrounded by magical energy and sent flying out of the spellmaster's tower.
& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Ardinius the Sore landed roughly, and immediately got to his feet and began charging heedlessly back to the tower, only to bounce off an invisible wall, barring him entry.

"The younglings had run at the sight of his lightsaber. Someone had warned them of the coming purge, and it had given them time to prepare. They had caught him off-guard originally. He had not foreseen that they would freeze ice on the staircase. When he had forcefully placed his foot on the sixteenth step, he immediately lost his balance and had fallen. That earned a few bruises. Closer, careful inspection had revealed ice that was generated by some hodgepodge device hooked to the thermo-systems.
""Very clever younglings, but it will take more than that.""
He simply leapt up the staircase, easily avoiding the icy patch. He smirked and landed on the top floor – immediately falling through the weakened boards and crashing into the maintenance room under the stairs with a large crash.
The maintenance room was dingy, and… sticky? He had landed in some strange, black mud. He struggled out of the substance, but it clung to his robes making him feel sluggish and hindering his movement.
""Well, at least it isn't sand.""
Was this just poor janitorial work or something more sinister? The droids had never malfunctioned like this before. He received his answer once he opened the door of the maintenance room. A long string had been attached to the bottom of the swish-door and hooked up to a large fan. When the door swooshed upwards, the string was pulled, simultaneously turning on the fan and slicing open a large space-sack open with a plasma-cutter. Endorian chicken feathers were blown in at him in a huge wave. The force of them pushed him straight back through the doorway and into the black sludge, knocking a repulsorbroom to the side.
He stumbled back out of the room, now covered in feather and sludge. Cute. Very cute.
""Younglings!"" he screamed, ""Give up!""
""Hey Master! Up here!"" a squeaky voice from above replied. At the sound of the youngling, Anakin instinctively looked up. An iron-droid clattered from above and landed straight onto his face. It sizzled and burned through the layer of feathers and scorched his face. Anakin screamed loudly, and wrenched it free from his face. He tingled with pain and rage. The little bastards!
He was losing himself to his hatred and fear. He needed to reflect and regroup.
Leaving the central chamber swiftly, he approached the meditation hall. Though his vision was obscured by feathers, he could see clearly that the corridor had been strewn with mini-groundcars: the type that younglings loved to play with. He cautiously approached them, but couldn't see any way that the younglings had sabotaged them. He picked his way through the corridor and entered the meditation hall.
There he could wash the sludge from himself and treat his burned face in the meditation pool. At the first sight of water, he fell to his knees and pushed his face down into the pool. Grateful for the brief respite, Anakin thought on his situation. How could the younglings pose such a thre- Zzzzap! Someone had electrified the meditation chamber using a thermal slicer. Anakin was pushed straight out of the water, his spine snapping into an upright position. He stumbled backwards into the corridor of the mini-groundcars. His foot landed on one of the wheeled toys and he slipped backwards, his legs dashing up into the air and his head cracking on the hard floor. This entire place had been booby-trapped, and the time for meditation was over.
Anakin had lost his patience and was now operating under a bestial rage. Nothing could compare to his powers in the force – nothing, except, for the plucky courage of some younglings apparently. This rage was making him sloppy. When his feet were stuck in hydro-glue he merely ripped his boots off and strode on. He clattered through the shards of glass on the floor. He deflected the BB-gun aimed at his crotch. He didn't care anymore, he was sick of these capers. He endured every little prank the younglings threw at him – including the hidden blow-torch and the resulting bursts of flame that emerged when he had sought to extinguish his burning hair and feathers in the waters of the refresher.
This place was a death trap. Anakin could barely see; one side of his face was covered in sludge and feathers, and the other half was puffed up and burnt from the iron-droid. He ached all over and could barely feel his cut feet. Finally, however, he was able to glimpse the silhouettes of figures in the distance. The younglings! Screaming with rage, he began to sprint after the obfuscated creatures. He ran faster than he ever had before. He almost giggled with glee as he reached a figure and – SLAM!
His face smashed into a wall and he fell on his behind. Someone had manipulated the light of the lumen globe with a shade, creating little shadow puppets. It no longer felt regrettable to slaughter these younglings, but Anakin wasn't even sure where he was anymore, whether he was even in the Jedi Temple or what room. The last hour was a blur of hijinks and pain. He rubbed his head and looked around. Where was he? It looked like he had ended up in the underground catacombs of the Temple.
""Hey, Master! Get a load of this!"" Anakin stared dumbly as the younglings hammer blow struck a supporting column of the ceiling.
The ceiling gave way above his head. Looking up, he saw its occupant – sand. Sand everywhere. Anakin screamed in rage and fear, bringing his hands up to cover his face from the intrusive substance. He had lost access to reason; his anger had made him strong in the darkside, but weak in his ability to withstand plucky underdogs. It fell down upon him, like a rough and irritating blanket. As the coarse sand filled his lungs, he had only one thought; ""it's getting
everywhere!""
---------------
Macally Kuo Khan, the eldest youngling, looked at the mound of sand in triumph. The plan had been a success, but there could be more bandits on their way. He and the others would have to reset the traps and prepare.

"""Hey, man. Did you see that new movie out?"" said Alex in a chatroom with about a dozen other regular prompt-readers and responders.
She awaited a response, tapping at the edge of her keyboard awaiting an answer. The chat was and had been dead for the past hour, so the girl decided to go ahead and make some tea while she waited.
Eventually, her aunt came by to visit and point out just how fat that the online-writer had gotten, before proceeding to eat the rest of the cookies in the pantry, leaving behind a bag of cuckoo clocks, and leaving with her new muscle-headed biker fuckbuddy.
Alex, thinking nothing of this in particular, returned to the IRC chatroom to see a varying amount of greeting messages done in the usually unique styles.
""HI ALEX!""
""Yo.""
""Hello, Ally.""
*Something about a cellar. *
Etc.
Eventually, the conversation shifted gears over the course of an hour, from the story of a guy's trip to the grocery store, a new puppy, and a wordsprint or two. Finally, they arrived back on the topic of the movie that Alex had brought up about four hours ago.
Yes, it was a certain movie, based off a certain prompt, that was totally and completely original in every single way. Absolutely. Completely and utterly unheard of. Because that's what the internet is known for. Original content.
Yes.
""Which one, Alex?"" came the words of a fellow writer who was awaiting their daily pizza.
Alex tapped at the keys, ""The one about the odd, paranormal video tape that made people lose it-""
""That's been made a movie before.
""Err. What about the one where a bunch of cops decide to infiltrate a gang only to find out that everyone in it is a cop?""
""Been done before.""
""Crazy president goes dogshit on the USA?""
""I think Trump just won the election, actually.""
Alex sighed, resigned herself to the idea that every idea ever made had already existed before, only with a few alterations in noun, adjective, and maybe tone. So what that her prompt response had been turned into a movie without her making any money off of it?
It wasn't like it could JUST BE A FUCKING COINCIDENCE, COULD IT?!
No, it definitely was.
It wasn't like she even had a lawyer to sue if that were the case anyway. Why bother trying to throw at fit anyway?
Was she just supposed to gather up the rest of the writers and go and brigade movie studios and story houses?
No, screw that. Half of them don't give a shit and just lurk, a quarter of them are too busy with their dayjobs, the other ninety-nine percent of the quarter weren't really all that bothered with it anyway at all.
So what did that leave the one percent out of the quarter?
Worrying about absolutely nothing. That's what. It's not like they could've found their own film studio to do the movie for them. Geez.
Thus, Alex decided to ignore what was definitely not her dilemma at all, called up the rest of the crew, and decided to go watch that new movie that bore an odd resemblance to her Batman-Hitler romcom (directed by none other than Quentin Tarantino).
Not only did the girl enjoy the movie in normal, realistic happiness, she also further went on to...recommend the movie to a friend.
And that was just another realistic day in the life of Alex.",0
"Lord Herrington stepped up to the podium, gazing out at his audience. The usual learned men of London had gathered for the Royal Society's monthly presentation, but he also saw a multitude of members of the public in the audience as well, looking eagerly up at him.
With a sigh, Lord Herrington resisted the urge to reach up and adjust his pince-nez. Word of his return from the New World had traveled quickly, making him something of a celebrity among those with an adventurous mindset. They'd come tonight to here him tell his tale, hoping for glimpses of another world, one far beyond their own humdrum lives.
He intended to speak of his observations on the biological variations in life, but he sensed his audience's hunger for more. They didn't want to hear about varying adaptations in the hooves of Cervidates to adapt to the moist jungle environment.
So as he wound down his speech, Lord Herrington decided to throw a bone to these common folks who had come out to hear him speak. Perhaps, he thought to himself, he could ensure that they did not leave completely disappointed.
""And so, as I conclude, I want to share a legend that comes from the New World,"" he spoke up, noting how several sagging heads in the audience perked up at the mention of a legend. Yes, this was what they wanted.
Herrington smiled a little, his eyes growing slightly misty as he remembered the stream rising up from the sea in midday, the calls of men as they bent their backs over their hollow log canoes. He'd gone out with them, watched their lives unfold, learned about the intrigue and scandal and stories of their little village. And they, eventually, opened up to him with their stories.
""There is an island,"" he went on, ""known as Isla De La Plata, off the far coast of Ecuador, on the far shores of the sea we know as the Pacific. The island is far smaller than our own, and tough for adventurers to find, as it is oft shrouded in mist.""
Herrington looked up from his podium, his eyes sparkling as he looked around at the audience. ""But even more than that - the guide who brought me to Isla De La Plata claims that it moves, and this is why only those from its shore can ever find their way back.""
For just a moment, Herrington let the idea dance in the minds of his audience. ""Of course, an island does not move, being a thing of unthinking rock,"" he went on after a beat, bringing them back down to reality. ""But on my visit to Isla De La Plata, I asked the elders about this fiction.""
""They told me this story, the same that I now tell to you.""
""Long ago, the elders say, all life lived below the surface of the ocean. There was no land, only water. Many creatures lived in the water, big and small, eating and mating and dying, never seeing anything that could be land.""
""But the god Cipatli, the great crocodile, saw that his many children suffered in the water. They were unable to hide from the other predators, and they appealed to their great father for aid.""
""Cipatli thought long and hard, and he feasted upon many of his offspring to gather his strength. With his great might, he dove to the bottom of the sea, scooping up the mud and raising it up, so that it might offer a barrier, a new land where his children could thrive. But he had nowhere to place the mud.""
""Here, the great Huitzilopochtli-"" Herrington struggled with the unfamiliar name, but his audience, spellbound, didn't seem to notice, ""-came to Cipatli, with cunning and a golden tongue. Huitzilopochtli convinced Cipatli to hold up the mud on his own back, to create a shelter for his children. Cipatli agreed, and spread the mud across his great back and rose to the surface of the water.""
""But Huitzilopochtli was a trickster,"" Herrington warned, holding up a wagging finger. Several listeners laughed at the little gesture. ""And the other gods came up onto the land that was formed from Cipatli's back, claiming it for their own. Cipatli's children could not fight them off, for they could not call on the aid of their great father, or they would all drown.""
""Cipatli was very angry at this betrayal, but he knew that, if he sank below the waves, all would perish, and his children would be no better than before. So he instead laid dormant, using his own cunning. He told his children to stay near the water, not to move to land like the other gods and their children.""
Lord Herrington, now just as caught up in the tale as his audience, affected a deep, gravelly tone for the voice of the crocodile god. ""'They have taken the land, that which I sought to give to you,' Cipatli told his children. 'But over time, they shall find themselves imprisoned upon that which they leapt to claim. They will no longer be able to survive in the water, while you, my children, shall always have both realms. And to remind them, you will wait in the river banks, and you will feast upon them, dragging them back into the water.""'
""And it was so. Cipatli became the land, and he gave up the land to the other gods - but they, and their children, learned to not stray too near the edge of the water, or Cipatli's children would reclaim them, pulling them back into the water they had abandoned, where they could not fight.""
Lord Herrington nodded, started to turn away - but then, just as the audience began to clap, he turned back, holding up a hand. ""Ah, but the island! I did not finish!"" he called out.
""You see, the elders believe that, like Cipatli, some of his children grew so big that they also swam down and scooped up mud, becoming land like their great father. It is on one of these offspring that the natives believe they dwell - but unlike the great state of Cipatli's hibernation, their offspring still kicks in his sleep, drifting around in the mist.""
Herrington coughed. ""The idea of living on the back of an animal is, naturally, quite ridiculous,"" he finished. ""But then again, the natives are content with their idea. And although you will laugh as you walk back to your homes, imagine standing on the shore of a misty island, gazing out into the lapping waves.""
""Now, imagine that the island began to sink, as Cipatli's children came to reclaim what once belonged to them.""
Out in the audience, Lord Herrington thought that he saw a shudder begin. He smiled a little to himself. ""Thank you for listening,"" he called out, as the applause rose up to drown him.

"That day - that damn day - best I've had since they came.
I remember it like it was yesterday. Was it yesterday? Everything runs together now. Everything runs together since they showed up. It all flows like a big, murky river, and I guess I'm just trying to keep my head above water. They came into our world like a flood and left just as quickly, each leaving their mark in some way. Some crafted holes in our world where cities used to be, others killed single, wildly unimportant people. Others, the reddish ones, healed children.
We don't know why they came, but our world has been in chaos ever since. There's this group of people, a religion maybe, that believes those things were gods, coming to our world to punish us or to set things right. They gathered together from every corner of the world and started trying to ""finish the job"" those things started. They killed indiscriminately and brutally. We, the resistance, the weak and the few, were the only sane force left in this world.
I commanded a squad back then, six guys I would do anything for. Turns out they'd do anything for me too.
Blake, Matt, Joe, Luke, Dave and Elijah. We dropped the military titles after the invasion. It wasn't worth it anymore. We were just men, and I just happened to have the most experience. I wasn't a leader by title, but by necessity.
We were trekking through what used to be Brooklyn that day. May 3rd. It was Spring. The sun laid on our backs, warm and kind, and our shadows stretched out before us like old friends. We hadn't seen the enemy in a week, it had stopped raining, and we lost contact with command a long time ago. That meant we were on our own, but it also meant we didn't have to deal with objectives or goals. We just had to stay alive.
Joe broke down the door of a convenience store to look for a twinkie, and the rest of us followed him in to find some more respectable food.
We found a few packs of fritos, an arizona iced tea, but left the hot dogs as they were. We were about to walk out the door to enjoy our spoils, when Blake yelled back at me.
""There's something behind the counter. In the glass. It's a pack of something. Anybody know if I can eat it?""
I sprinted back inside. There's no way. There's no way they could still be here, still be ok. But as my eyes moved from the counter to the case behind it, I found them, that beautiful, sweet pack of cigarettes. I had never smoked before, but my dad used to spend hours telling stories about all the times he and his college buddies used to get together and smoke. He talked about porches and tables and dominoes and the way your head felt a ten feet off the ground when you breathed in that delicious poison.
I smashed the glass, pulled the pack out, and ripped off the cellophane.
No lighter.
My fingers, shaking now, reached for the first cigarette. I shoved it in my mouth clumsily, nearly breaking the filter. I could taste something, something incredible on my lips. I whipped out my pistol and fired a round into the air. My squad jumped and screamed, ran out of the gas station like girls - girls who had never smoked a cigarette.
I could hear some ancient AC/DC riff dancing through my head as I shoved the end of my cigarette onto the hot metal at the end of my pistol. That first drag, that first damn drag, hit me like hell. I took a few more and nearly fell on my ass. Tobacco doesn't treat newbies well. That was just fine with me.
I stumbled outside and passed six cigarettes out. I turned my back and walked toward the river as I heard six gunshots fire into the air. My lips formed a quiet smirk as the smoke rolled off my tongue.",0
"I haven't been in my best times in the past few days. All I know is I killed a man, in cold blood, with another person identifying himself as my partner and finally congratulating me on a job well done.
Had I known what I was I would have responded with a standard response a cold blooded killer might have given a comrade, which is I do not know. The instant I saw blood on myself I grew into a panic, breathing slowly, heavily, realizing what I have done, and having this man beside me congratulating me about it. it was very unsettling. wait, unsettling is downplaying it. IT WAS REALLY FUCKING TERRIFYING. I was so confused I ran to the nearest opening I can think of in the crowds staining blood on the people around me as I shrug to run to whatever sanctuary I can find.
I finally settled in a barren alley, trying to figure out what I have done. first of all I tried to remember the scene but it was too much of a strain even for me, I can't remember anything at all, as to why I did it, I don't know, as to who was with me, he told me that he was an ally or something, as to where I am, I don't know. 'Why has this happened to me' was all I can think of at that moment.
I then went to a shady apartment of some sort to clear things off my mind. With a stroke of luck I am actually a pocket-wealthy person, as I managed to collect around $300 on myself, using it as payment for a night's stay. My name? I can't even remember a simple thing as my own name. so I settle for Frank. last name? uhhh anything goes...hmmm...uhhh.... Baker. Frank Baker's the name, or what I will be for now, as I write to check in, and hurry along my room.
Laying in bed, resting from the nightmare of a day I have had, I try to think for clues, I thought 'the knife back at the scene would surely tip me off', 'why can't I remember my partner in this incident, who was he?', 'why was I there?', 'what was my motive?'
I thought to myself long and hard, and after weighing my thoughts I convinced myself to go back and examine the scene of the crime, inconspicuously of course. I rent a new change of clothes and luckily I have been endowed by my unknown parents with genes of bearded men, so hiding myself won't be a problem so much as to shaving the beard off. finally at a glance in the mirror I see myself quite well endowed with facial features as well, but sadly I thought of this face also as the face of a killer as I hung my head in dismay.
With my makeshift coat and new garments I shift along returning to the scene of the crime, to find it riddled with sirens, and people of authority. as I try to walk along observing slowly, I overheard 'must have been a hard life' 'I mean how can a man murder someone who can't even remember himself, a man with amnesia' 'And a young man himself!'. I was suddenly taken aback, all I could think was to despair in the form of regret, knowing my victim's innocence, and how could I have, with my hands, killed such a man.
I felt guilty, I was trying to think of alibis, I started to panic once more, and I felt that everyone was there to gang up against me, I felt small in the world at that moment, all I could think of was run. but that might put me into more attention than I am currently needing. what do I do.... what do I do...
suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder. I wasn't able to see who it was, then I felt a tugging on my hand as I was dragged to a secluded place, by this unknown captor.

"One billion dollars to kill one billion people. That was the hardest contract in my whole life.
Let's start from the beginning. Technology in the US was in all time high, medicine was really good and really cheap, long story short, people weren't dying anymore and that was bad.
I was hired by the comission of president Trump, the US had 2 billion citzens, and Mr Trump wanted half of them gone.
I accepted the contract more as a challenge really. Could I kill 1 billion people and make it like an accident?
I started by the obvious. I infiltrated the command tower of an airport, I gave the officers in the area some slipping pills, putting in their coffe. After they were asleep I scrambled the plane's routes. I locked the door and left to watch the fireworks from the distance. With the number of plains I can say that I killed around 20 thousand people.
Next target was a train going to NYC. This plan was more elaborate. Not only did I take of the breakes of the train but I also disguised myself as worker from the station broke the rails near the plataform. I made a sort of ramp with them. The train arrived, got off the rails and into the plataform killing a lot of people. The station then started to crumble after the train hit some supports, it wasn't pretty and it was rush hour so I got around 500 thousand people. It was good, but not enough I had to step up my game.
The next target was when things got serious, a well known rapper was performing in LA. He was going to play indoors and he had sold 40 million tickets for the show. I did the simple thing, I infiltrated the kitchen area, knocked out the cooks and dumped a lot of propane tanks around the kitchen, and then I allowed their gas to go the stage. I called the police acting as a cook and talked about a gas leak. It worked like a charm, after I left the singer asked his fans the raise their lighters, the explosion was bigger than I thought it took the 40 million in the show plus 60 million from the area around it.
100 million still wasn't enough. But I had the ultimate idea. I asked Mr Trump for access to one of his plane carriers and 50 megaton bomb, Trump trusted me, I had done a lot to him by now and he was kind of dumb, so he gave me without a second thought. After that it was simple. I flied the plane to Washington DC, where it had an ""engine"" accident and fell down. The bomb exploded and 980 million people died, I was able to kill more than a billion people.
You might ask yourself now, ""but why did you attack washington? You killed the president and you weren't paid!"" The answer is I did it because I could do it. President Trump was a dick and I got him to let his guard down. And the money? Well there were a lot of bounties on the president's head and someone has to collect them right? Never trust someone that only thinks about money kid, that's a life lesson",0
"Two blurry colors were making zig zag motions around the city. One is yellow and the other red. The yellow one seemed to be ahead of the red one. It was Eobard Thawne and Barry Allen running against each other. The city seemed like it stood still in time compared to how fast these two were moving.
Barry was trying his best but he just can't seem to keep up. He thought he'd done everything right. He gave away everything he possessed to charity and anyone else who needed it. He had nothing except for the suit on his body. But how come he's still slower than his foe. Could it be? Thawne is somehow more destitute than him? But how? He's at zero. Could it be that Thawne owned someone money? No, Barry has already tried that. He took a loan and got himself in debt to see if he got faster before he got into this fight and he didn't. The maximum power you can get from this power scheme is when you have nothing. Debts doesn't account into it. But-
Thawne saw Barry's confusion and took the advantage and swung at Barry hard. The Flash couldn't react in time and got hit. It was a powerful punch. One of his teeth came off and Barry was thrown of course hard. He spun on the ground for several cycles and couldn't stop himself.
""Do you want to know why you're losing, Barry? You can feel it, don't you? You're getting slower."" said Thawne gleefully. Barry was in pain but he can still see how smug Thawne is. He was right though. He does feel more lethargic. What's happening? Barry is at his poorest, he can't be slowing down. Did Thawne do something?
""Look at your pocket, Barry."" taunted the man in yellow. Barry was confused but did what Thawne told him to do anyway. There was something in pocket. Odd. It was paper. Barry hastily tore it out of his pocket and looked at it. It was a lottery ticket. Dated today.
""It's the winning lottery, Barry"" smiled Thawne. ""You're rich now!""
""How-""
""It was me all along, Barry! Me!"" Thawne was hysterical at this point.",0
"/u/Silverspy01, /u/NeonShockz, /u/StormsAndWolves, and /u/JulienBrightside approached the village, and /u/Silverspy01 let himself relax. He wouldn't tell the others, but the plants had scared him. He knew nothing about them, and he hated not knowing. Well, they couldn't get him here. Cookies would help everyone. Approaching the central square, /u/Silverspy01 saw a crowd listening to a lone man. Another survivor must have showed up while they were gone. As /u/Silverspy01 came closer, he began to notice more details. The man was shirtless, covered in scars. Specially displayed was a large ""R"" carved into his chest, from the looks of it recently. The ring finger on the left hand was also missing. By the look of it this man had been in a bad situation. But who was he? /u/Silverspy01 began to shove his way to the front of the crowd. ""Excuse me, pardon me, sorry, coming through."" As he got to the front, he slowed and came to a stop. Standing before him was an impossibility. Someone who he had thought dead, and one of the worst inhabitants of the old world. This was not possible. He had seen the death himself.
""/u/Braz-dur?!""
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -
Reknor stood up. ""WHO SAID THAT?!"" he roared, rage twisting his features. Townsfolk scattered at his sudden rage and reformed at the edge of the square. Leaving one man, and his three companions.
""I did."" the one at the front spoke. ""I am /u/Silverspy01. I built this town for peace. You are not welcome here.
""/u/Silverspy01?"" Reknor grinned. ""Just who I was waiting for."" With that, he leaped at /u/Silverspy01, knocking him to the ground. One of /u/Silverspy01's companions raised his hands, static electricity beginning to build up. A bolt of lightning arched towards Reknor, only to dissipate midair. Reknor got his hands around /u/Silverspy01's throat and tried to squeeze. But for some reason, /u/Silverspy01 remained unaffected. Another bother tried to attack him with a knife with a cry of ""protect the king! "", but tripped and fell. Abandoning /u/Silverspy01's throat, Reknor stood up as if to stomp on him. But yet again, and invisible force seemed to block his kicks. Reknor glanced around, and saw a woman standing off to the side, looking around uncertainly. When she saw Reknor looking at her, she began to raise her gun. She was too late. Reknor grabbed it out of his hands, turned back to /u/Silverspy01, and squeezed the trigger...only to misfire. Cursing his luck, he ran back at /u/Silverspy01 intending to beat him with his bare hands. But yet again he was repelled.
Reknor wasn't stupid. He knew that some other entity was a part of this, one who seemed to be more powerful then Reknor. He doubted his Nors would be much good either. But they could still hide and plan. It was always good to have a secret weapon. Givign one last snarl, he turned and fled the village. /u/Silverspy01 seemed to be protected, but no protection was invincible. All he would have to do was find its weakness.
---
/u/NeonShockz watched Reknor run away. ""Should we go after him?"" he asked, his hands still crackling with electricity.
/u/Silverspy01 got up and dusted himself off. ""No,"" he replied. ""You saw how easily he attacked us. The protection only works inside the village, and I would hate for him to kill me. As much as I hate it, our best bet is to stay here for now. I would like to thank you two for trying to help me."" At this he nodded towards /u/NeonShockz and /u/JulienBrightside. ""And of course /u/StormsAndWolves must have known about the protection in place and decided not to waste bullets."" Now, I wonder how /u/Braz-dur came back...I was sure he was dead. But I suppose it wouldn't be the strangest thing that's happened in the last few days.",0
"Without my hoodie on, the fall air stung my arms as I tied the sleeves as tightly as I could around his leg. My white sweatshirt now an eery crimson.
""Hu-hurts. Stop that, it hurts.""
""Can't stop, sorry. Tourniquet. Gotta stop the bleeding. Your femoral artery is cut."" I say louder than normal so as to be heard over his anguished groans.
""I'm going to die.""
""No, you're not.""
""Julian,"" He says, defeated. I meet his eyes.
""You're not going to die. We're going to get out of here. Hang on, this is going to hurt.""
Holding the sleeves of my hoodie, I yank them tight around his slashed up thigh, effectively turning a jacket into medical equipment. When I do it, he screams a scream like no other I've ever heard. A scream that reaches out and out and could seemingly be heard for miles.
""You bastard.""
""I had to, sorry. Put pressure on the wound, like I'm doing now. Hold on as tightly as you possibly can, and for the love of God, don't let go.""
""Where are you going?"" He pleads, pushing hard to stop the bleeding.
""To flair for the rest of the group. You're in no shape to hike back to camp.""
""No! I told you, it wasn't the fall that hurt me! There's somebody out there! I told you, Julian! They tried to kill me. The rest o the group is dead! I saw them, I saw them! We should never have split up-""
""Hey, Max! Ssh, it's okay. That's just the blood loss and dehydration talking. There's nobody out there. I'll be back.""
""Don't go, don't go."" He says, just as panicked, but weaker.
""Hold on tight,"" I say giving a gesture to his leg. ""And don't let go.""
With my bag on my shoulder, I make my way away from the overhang Max is laying under, and into the vast woods. It's painful to leave him like that, but I have no choice. The sun is starting to set, and I need to make it back to Max before dark. Looks the two of us will be spending another night sleeping under that thing, away from camp. Two days since we got lost. One day until any infection that is nestled in Max's leg could become fatal- if he hasn't bleed out by then.
""Dammit."" I yell out to nobody. It's just me and my thoughts and the endless, engulfing forest.
It'll be fine, I tell myself. It'll be fine. I'll signal the group. they'll find us by morning, and we'll all go home.
Deeper I trek into the trees, looking for a clearing to shoot up a flair. I don't make it.
The crunch of leaves under feet sneaking up behind me.
The sharp, stabbing pain in my neck.
The ground beneath my head.
Blood warming my back against the cold night.
The eyes of a madman. The smile of a killer standing above me.
Max was right...",0
"I don't want to cut off his head, but I don't really have a choice. I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over. My insides turn as I feel the swing connect.
*Quit being so weak! You've done this before. *
The jock's girlfriend screams on cue, looks like she is going to faint. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. I see how scared she is, and I feel ashamed. I'm not the bad guy.
*Do I have to remind you? Remind you how they came here--to OUR home--and ransacked OUR things? They are trespassing! *
The door to the bedroom bursts open, and another girl storms in. I think her name was Whitney. She is holding a shovel. She surveys the scene, and I am impressed by how calm she seems. I decide to back off, but she takes that as a sign to attack. The shovel strikes me in the face, knocking my mask off. Before I can recover, I am hit again. Then a third time. The fourth strike sends me flying out the window. We are currently three stories high.
*How could you let her do that? *
I like the feeling of being weightless. Bits of shattered glass encompass me, sparkling with moonlight. I feel like I'm floating in space, surrounded by stars. Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break. I shift to make sure.
*Mother fucker! *
Yeah...it broke.
I landed in a pile of bushes, which cushioned my fall at least somewhat. Through the thick tangle of branches, I look up toward the broken window. Whitney is nervously peering out of it, scanning the grounds.
""He's gone."" she shouts before disappearing back into the house.
*You need to get up. They are getting away. If they get away, they will tell others. More people will come. Not just the shitty teenagers, either. For fuck's sake, GET UP! *
I know I have some time, so I take a moment to collect my thoughts. I don't like doing this: hurting people. It's better now that I'm numb to it. It's not my fault they keep coming here. It's not my fault he makes me hurt them. I'm not the bad guy.
From the other side of the house, I hear the front door open, followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel.
""Keep it together, Cindy. I need you to keep it together"" Whitney's voice is stern but supportive.
Though she doesn't speak, Cindy's breathing begins to steady.
I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open. In the next few seconds, they will drive off, and I can go back to being alone.
*Except their car won't start. You saw to that. *
The engine begins to hang, and I hear the girls swearing. They keep trying, but it's no use.
He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I don't want to. He makes me run despite the pain in my side. The girls scream as soon as I round the corner. They throw open their car doors and begin to flee. He tries to make me chase them, but I refuse.
*If you can't do what needs doing, fine. I'll do it! *
I am too weak to fight him. He takes control of me, one limb at a time, and everything fades.
When I wake up, I am in the woods. It is almost pitch black, but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance. I start walking toward it, but my foot catches on something, almost knocking me over. I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. Some of the diamonds are red now. I try not to think about her again as I continue walking.
As I approach the cabin door, something triggers in the back of my mind. I feel isolated, safe. The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside.
There are pictures covering the walls, drawings of spaceships and planets and stars. I look closer and find that each picture has something in common: a drawing of a boy with a space helmet. He looks happy. I find something else, too: a photograph.
This one is of also of a boy, a real one. He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head, cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings. He isn't alone, though; there is a man standing behind him. His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks. Though I can't see his face, the man terrifies me. He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear--
A scream comes from behind me, followed by another blow to the head. I stumble around to see Whitney, this time holding a metal baseball bat. She swings at me again, but I catch it in my left hand. Before I can stop it, my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face. She flies backward onto an old table, which breaks underneath her.
*She's on the ground. It's time to finish it. *
I don't want to.
*I don't care what you want, just do what I tell you. *
No.
*Do it, you piece of shit. Do it or I will! *
NO!
I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room. The force of it brings me to my knees. Even as I resist, I begin to feel him taking control. My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon. Before he can grab it, I kick it away. It skids to a halt right next to Whitney. She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward.
It surprises me that I don't feel pain when the blade enters my chest. Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead. I feel my body begin to go limp again, though nothing steps in to take control.
""Die!"" Whitney shouts at me, but I don't blame her.
I don't mind that she doesn't understand. I don't even care if he does. It's only important that I know it, that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade.
I'm not the bad guy.",0
"A quick scan around the room begins to inform the stranger about his whereabouts. He doesn't fully understand the items he's looking at, or his surroundings but there is an air of familiarity to it all. He can't remember why or how, but he's been here before, plenty often. The smell of oil, sweat and steel is a significant clue. Smells are a potent trigger for memory and this all smells so familiar, yet just out of reach. Except for the bloated, stained corpses, those smell awful and by the looks of it, they've been there for quite some time.
He looks up at the rafters, seeing where his rope snapped and says a silent prayer of gratitude to whatever circumstances caused it to fail so fortuitously for himself. Not recognizing the others, he hopes they went peacefully, though the tear stains streaming down their faces tells otherwise. 'She looks like she may have once been so very beautiful.' he thinks to himself as he stares at the female corpse staring down tragically at him lying there on the ground.
SNAP! His knee buckles underneath him as he tries to stand. 'That doesn't sound or feel at all good', he thinks to himself as he falls back down to the cold, oil stained ground. He decides to sit and gather his thoughts a bit more before he tries to stand up again. Not that he has much choice in the matter at this point.
'What the hell is going on?' he mutters anxiously. 'Why can't I remember anything?' That's when he feels a warm, wet spot on the back of his head. He reaches back there, grazing it gently with his fingers to feel a sharp pain and a squishy, shattered sensation. His fingers come back to his eyes to reveal streaks of thick blood coursing from his fingers down his palm. Blood, he remembers seeing blood before. Recently and a lot more of it than what's dripping from his fingers currently. 'Blood everywhere.'
The memory is a strange, miraculous thing sometimes. A zoetrope-like sensation of memories as images begin to carousel through his mind with little concern for logic or relevance. He sees images of death, hundreds of bodies lying prostrate in the suburban streets of Anywheresville, USA. Flashes of broadcasts showing military forces raining bullets on what appear to be civilians, though the stumbling gait and mindless wanderings indicate something else...something horrifically worse. Another flash of a group of people screaming, begging for safe entry into a home; HIS home! A concerned family; two young boys and a scared, compassionate women looking to him for guidance, to know what to do, to have all the answers and to keep them safe.
""What do we do, Dad?! I'm scared and they won't stop screaming!"" He remembers that last sentence so vividly now, the fear warbling in his son's voice. He remembers reaching for the doorknob and looking back at his wife for reassurance, before opening the door to let the unknown in, if only to quiet the small mob that's gathered to avoid bringing any further attention to the family house. The memory of his wife's fearful look is what does it; opens up the floodgates to a full, horrific recall of the apocalyptic events and tragic circumstances he's awakened into.
It all got so much worse, so rapidly after that. 'I should have never opened that damn door' he mutters to himself mournfully as he drags the length of rope and himself to the locked door of the garage.
'I'll be home for dinner, honey.' he says to himself through choked back tears, as he slips the rope once again round his neck, feeling the familiar scratch and ties the end just taught enough around the doorknob.
'I'll be home just in time, dear...' as he slumps himself down, pulling the rope down tight with him.",0
"The computer gave a three note chime of discovery, waking Ben from his light doze. He knuckled his eyes, feeling grimy. They'd been out for six weeks, nearly double the length of a normal run, but had been having bad luck. Every wreck he'd scanned up was tagged, and touching them was against the law. He figured he had enough problems without Galactic police hunting him down, so he'd moved on. But every time, his worry sharpened. He had a family to provide for, and a salvager who couldn't find wrecks starved.
After the tenth time pinging a tagged wreck, he'd decided to sweep an asteroid belt. He hated to take the risk, but they were running out of time. He hadn't bothered to wake Jade up from hypersleep and ask her if she minded putting their lives at risk. She would have just shrugged, anyway.
Ben thought sometimes that God had forgotten to put fear in that woman when He made her. Or any other emotions. The only things she expressed interest in were wrecks, and spending as much time in hypersleep as possible. He had a wife and daughter, and left skipping across time to Jade, who cared for no one. They had been partners for twenty years, and she didn't look a day over twenty-three, while Ben was starting to gray. He had a feeling she would long outlive him. But at least when he'd asked her to split their income 70/30, she had just shrugged.
""Is it tagged?"" Ben croaked at the computer.
""Tag not found.""
""How big is it?"" he asked, excitement beginning to rise.
""Artificial matrices scan over 100 kilometers.""
""Tag it now!"" he said joyfully.
""Tagging,"" said the computer obediently, but Ben wasn't listening. He was already out of his pilot's chair and pulling himself to the back of the little wrecker. The ship he owned was almost all cargo bay, but he did have all four sleep pods required by law nestled in the corridor to the main airlock.
He punched in the code sequence for sleep release and waited. If he hadn't been in zero gravity he would have bounced from foot to foot, but instead he fidgeted by pushing himself back and forth between the corridor walls.
At long last the pod door slid aside, and Jade floated out, her short black hair standing on end.
""What've you got?"" she asked at once.
""Big one,"" he said. ""100km.""
She gave a small smile. ""We'd better get to work.""
*****
The wreck wasn't just large, they soon discovered. It was a transport ship hauling platinum, and Ben was a little surprised the company hadn't sent out a recovery team. Salvagers rarely came across such large, valuable finds. Perhaps the shipping route hadn't been received properly, and the ship was badly off course. A good insurance policy or the risk of the asteroid belt may also have made recovery a losing proposition.
In any case, he was glad they hadn't. A wreck like this came once in a lifetime, and would set them up for years. Jade had been tractoring in neat packs of foam-wrapped titanium for two days, and the hold was nearly full. It would take four trips just to retrieve the cargo, and several more for the ship parts.
Ben had done two EVAs, searching for the sleep pods. The computer told him it couldn't find any active signals, and he knew that transport ships were often unmanned, but he still always looked. He had found three empty pods, and was suiting up for another EVA to look for the fourth, when Jade opened her mic.
""Ben, you should take a look at this.""
""Be right there.""
He hooked his helmet to his belt and headed for the cargo bay. His partner was strapped into the tractor control seat outside. Jade was deft with the tractors, able to spin the fine filaments out eight at time without tangling them. She was a worthy partner just for that; Ben could only handle four tractors at once, and preferred EVAs.
""It's strange,"" she said, pointing at the screen. All eight filaments were out and pointing at the same object. They looked like snakes poised to strike.
""What is that?"" He peered at the screen.
""I don't know. I thought it was a piece of the ship, but the tractors won't lock on.""
""Let's get a look at it through one of the tractor cams.""
Jade gave the command, and the object appeared on the screen, much bigger, but still indistinct.
""I think it's an asteroid,"" she said. ""I've never seen one that looked like that, though.""
Ben agreed. It was the shape of a small asteroid, lumpy and oblong, but it seemed to shine with many colors, and he couldn't quite tell where the edges were.
""How big is it? Can we get a better picture?""
""Seems to be about fifty meters across. This is the best the tractors can do. Sorry.""
""I was going out anyway,"" he said. ""I can get a good look at it with the suit cam.""
Jade shrugged. ""We've got plenty here without some weird rock,"" she said. ""Up to you.""
But his curiosity was spiked. The asteroid, if that's what it was, was fifty kilometers out, so he locked his suit into the EXO, making sure its thrusters were full.
Traveling fast was a recipe for death in an asteroid belt, so he kept his speed at ten meters per second. It took him over an hour to near the asteroid. The tractors were long gone, and he knew they would be hard at work elsewhere in the site.
He used the thrusters to slow his approach, and made sure his suit cam was on.
""About there,"" he told Jade.
""Copy.""
He was close enough to see the colors, and while he examined them they shifted and rippled.
""The colors we saw are moving. It might be rotating, can't tell yet. Going to get closer.""
""Copy,"" said Jade dutifully.
Ben moved in at half a meter per second. When he realized what he was seeing, he stopped breathing.
""They're flowers,"" he whispered.
He swept his gaze over the shining things, struck with wonder. There were no leaves, only petals. The ones nearest him were a deep blue, edged with an electric purple shot with green, the tips hinting at colors no human eye could see. Each flower was a trumpet, with six petals fanned out like lilies.
""Say again,"" Jade's voice seemed very far away.
Ben fixed his eye on a single flower, watching as its blue blossomed into red. Its bell and those of its immediate fellows turned toward him slowly, as if in greeting, then away.
""It's an asteroid, all right,"" he said. ""It's growing flowers.""
""Flowers?"" He had never heard Jade sound confused before.
""Space lilies,"" he laughed. ""I've never seen anything like it. How is this possible?""
""Copy. I think you should come in, Ben.""
""I will."" He reached out and stroked the underside of a petal. It moved with his finger, closing slowly, then returned to its original position. It reopened, undisturbed.
""Ben,"" she said, worry in her voice.
""It's all right, I'm coming."" Regretfully, he turned away. He was careful not to point his thrusters at the flower colony when he left.
*****
Jade tried to hide how impressed she was with the video he had taken, but he wasn't fooled. She was almost as excited as he was.
""Do you know what this means?"" he said.
""We send out the beacon for discovery of alien life.""
""And?""
""And it's under our tag. We're going to be extremely wealthy.""
Jade smiled. ""You'd better go send a message to your wife. You aren't going to be home for a while.""
Ben smiled back. ""But when I get there, I get to stay. Say, do you wanna buy a ship?""",0
"I had poached eggs, the day the world ended.
Now all I have is a blanket and vine-wrapped broken highway in front of me that seems to go on forever.
(the highway, not the blanket.)
But it started with poached eggs and a figure in a lab coat. It walked into my kitchen, stopped right by Amy's side,
looking right at me.
""Thank you for your time, Mr. Taylor.""
I dropped the fork on the table. Amy was frowning too, and so was Zara (that's our daughter).
""What? Who are you? What is –""
""Please bear in mind that it might take a while, but everything will make sense once the haze of The Box goes away. Thank you very much.""
And I'll never forget the poached eggs. I'll never forget because that's when I got up and dropped them and the
plate crashed, and my eyes stopped on Zara's, and she was so scared. It was one second--one second when time stood still, even the crashing sound seemed to linger--and before I could say or do anything, the world went black.
& nbsp;
And then I opened my eyes to the broken world. And no memories. I know nothing of what happened to Amy or Zara. No idea how I got here.
It went from the crashing and the eggs and Zara to silence, and then an open blue sky. Chirping. Leaves rattling and a cold wind, my back against the dirt. I raised my head and looked around.
Trees. An open field. And the distant silhouette of a skeleton city.
I don't know what happened to the world.
You know what I *do* know, though? I know I've been wandering around for three months, and I've yet to see
another human face. I know I've killed a coyote with my bare hands last week, right next to a rotten building that used to be the Griffith Observatory. I know I went past Hollywood Boulevard a couple of days ago, and the Chinese Theater is now a wolf lair, so don't go there.
From that plate crashing spilling poached eggs to the blue, cloudless sky and my back against the dirt, I went from a married man with an apartment in Santa Monica to a cave man.
To the last man in the world.
I have no idea what's going on. But I'm finding Amy. I'm finding Zara.
The day after I woke up I found something in my pocket. It was a piece of paper, old like over thirty years. A page
from a notebook, yellow and flaky. Written in child handwriting was a smiley face and the words 'I'm Tracy.'
I had no memory of this at all.
Then in another handwriting, 'What do you think they're going to do to us?'
And in the first one, 'I don't know. What's *The Box*?'
And then, 'I'm scared.'
I have no idea what's going on. But I'm gonna find out.
The sky is getting darker. I should find a place to sleep. And then tomorrow…
Tomorrow is the day I'll find Amy and Zara.
I have to keep telling myself that. It's what keeps me going. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow.
Thunder. Look like it's raining tonight.
Tomorrow.

"I blink.
Another day passes by in my life as I lay in my bed. This life passing through time bores me now, I think I'll try something new today. Getting out of bed I look to my left to see him.
It?
Whatever. He's a him to me, I've honestly given up on remembering when or why I think he's a him. It's really been so long since I've been ten. They always did laugh at me for the animal I've been given. The weirdo, the freak and the oddball. The day I got him was both the worst and best day of my life. It's the day I learned that I will never really be like the others, but at the same time I learned that that was okay. Honestly, who cares about the opinions of those who are lost.
I get up and dress myself in whatever I can find. Most of my clothes are wearing rather thin. I should think about making more. It's always hard to come up with more reasons to get up in the morning so an actual task would be welcome. I'll need to find some cloth to work with. Maybe I can find some in town, there's bound to be some at the market still.
I put on my boots and make my way over to town. I guess it's a long walk? It's been a while since I went into town but I really don't mind the time lost. The market isn't too deep in the town. Just a few miles from the sign welcoming you in.
It's quiet like always. I try to remember the town like it was when I was younger. I think I used to come by here with some people, maybe family? I forget why I came, just some landmarks seem familiar. I finish up my business in town and start making my way back home. It's long. But I guess that makes sense.
I walk back through the door to my apartment and take off my boots. It's been a long day and it's almost night so I set what I got aside for a later day. It's just some clothes, they can wait. Going to a window I look out and take in the sights set before me.
A city. A great city. Well was a great city. Not barren and empty. It's a wonder that the buildings can survive for so long but I guess that is the wonder of modern engineering. Truly amazing that this city can survive thousands of years of nature rising up against it. I lose count of how long it's been but I guess after a while it doesn't really matter.
I walk back into my room. It is dark except for the glow he gives off. A faint glow but familiar. He floats in his little tank like he's done for as long as I can remember. My memories might be blurring now but that day is still fresh in my memory. I remember looking up what in the world he was. Turritopsis dohrnii.

"Somehow I ended up playing the detective. The mission commander didn't want anything to do with the investigation but said someone had to figure out how Jones died. I was reluctant, even after everyone voted it should be me. I guess I was the only logical choice, having spent part of my career working for the FBI crime lab.
We knew it was murder. You don't remove your own helmet in atmosphere like that. Especially not since the helmet requires a latch to be flipped on the back, past where you can reach with the suit's limited mobility. So how do I find out who did it? After checking all the station's cameras, it's obvious there was someone with Jones when he went through the airlock. That's not good.
I decided to begin questioning. I talked to the whole crew. I couldn't pin a motive on anyone. Jones and Martin were known lovers. Martin had an air-tight alibi as she had been in the lab, and was recorded there on camera. She was so beautiful and perfect. Jones had been a lucky guy.
Watching the video of him suffocating to death had been tough. It was harder than seeing it in person.",0
"The day has come. And I can't believe it. I have worked for reddit for so long now. I kept their servers alive. I worked endless hours when celebrities were doing AMA's to make sure it didn't crash. I typed furiously doing my own AMA telling everyone how awesome this whole thing was. I honestly thought reddit would be here long after my skills had deteriorated and I could no longer see the screen.
A year or so ago facebook went the way of myspace. And myspace is so far out of sight now that when you ask someone who is younger if they know what it is, they assume you are talking about something in the phone book days. I mean, come on! Who gets phone books delivered to their house printed out on paper! That's just stupid!
Anyway, I should have known then that we were becoming a thing of the past. Our user base was down. A lot, it turns out. But I thought it was fine. People would rediscover how awesome reddit was. People would flock back to us like hipsters flocked to oversizes glasses in the 10's. But it doesn't look like anyone is coming.
So today is the last day of reddit. Today I shut down the servers and walk away. Tomorrow, reddit will be a thing of the past that people will talk about with a loving remembrance but nothing more. There are new sites now, and maybe we will get mentioned on some of them. An old interview. An old meme. Something.
So, to anyone left out there (if there is anyone out there still) AMA. I am the last reddit employee and I will be shutting down the servers in a couple of hours. What do you want to know? What do you want to remember? What's your favorite reddit memory?
..... (one hour passes)
..... (another hour)
..... (three hours now)
...... (four hours, no responses. no votes. nothing)
Nothing? Ok then. It's time to go. Farewell old friend. It's been a fun ride.

"It's only a few seconds before I remember, but once I notice, that's all I can think about. Before I lost my arm, I didn't realise that a distraction can be unbearable. Just trying to complete thought processes is a challenge. Today I have a meeting with Lee and (where is my arm? Oh, that's right. I remember) so I'll need to finish off the report before (where is my arm? I lost it. Okay) eleven, and then I'll have to figure out if I'm having lunch with (where is my arm? Where is my arm?)
After the accident, I had assumed that this would fade. I crashed my car into a truck and ripped the nerves from my spinal cord. I know all this. Technically, the arm is still there, and I haven't lost it at all. They left it so they could try to graft nerves to the spine, and for hope, really. Seemingly unaware that I know all this, my mind constantly cycles through the realisation (Where is my arm?) and reminder (It's gone) and acceptance (Oh, okay). I can't think anything else.
Never mind losing my arm. I feel like I'm losing my mind.",0
"Vibrations! Vibrations and light. That was the key！ I mean it all goes back to Einstein right? e=mc squared。
And when you think about it, everything really is just a different form of vibration: energy waves, an objects wave function in space-time, the vibration of atoms and their vibrating strings.
Once I understood that it was all about getting the right vibration of sound and light. Then the mirrors would liquefy and form an Einstein-Rosen bridge of sorts, literally a gateway to another universe.
But suppose I didn't really think things through though.... I mean I was baffled when it worked, and even more baffled to learn that each mirror leads to its own separate universe!
And of course everything that happens here happens in unison there, so you can't really just expect to walk on in, there is another you in the way, mimicking your movements, thoughts, speech patterns etc, all in exact unison. Even shaking hands is impossible.
And don't even get me started on the dullness of the conversations!
""Oh Hey there! I'm from earth, wait, you are too. Oh, were saying the same exact thing at the same exact time aren't we? Wait...what am I thinking now? Last night's movie! His acting wasn't that good was it? Wow...we are literally speaking the same exact words at the same time, it is like we share a brain..... no.... its like we are the same person...wow this kinda sucks...""
So my dream of entering in was quickly abandoned. As was my dream of having a good conversation with an opponent as studied as myself. But hey! At least we can still send objects through!
In fact, I am actually eating toast from another universe!...... but.... it tastes and looks exactly like the toast I sent through...so maybe it isn't really all that interesting.... Or even all that useful...
Maybe I won't be getting that Nobel Peace Prize after all...",0

""You still having fun at 3:30 am?""
""Nah, just waiting around to sober up. What's your excuse?""

""Neither, I promise. I just want to…show you something.""
""Okay. Are you sure nothing's wrong? Now I'm scared there's a dead body in your bathroom or something.""
""Nothing like that. You just have to promise to never tell anyone else.""

""Me.""
""What? How?""

""I'm not a daredevil, Emma.""
""Look, it's got to be a mistake. Send it back. Have it tested.""
""Did that in second grade. That was when my parents got me a dog.""
""…this means, means you're going to…""

""No. That's not possible. You're Rob. You wouldn't choose to kill yourself.""
""I know it's possible. I see it happen every time I go to sleep. Cliffs, ropes, pills, guns. My subconscious is persistent, if not creative.""
""Oh god. That's why you don't sleep.""
""Bingo.""
""You, you can't let it freak you out like this. It'll probably be...when you're really old, you know. Like you're really old and Alzheimer's is starting to set in and you want to end it on your own terms. There's nothing wrong with that, right?""

""I don't know either.""
""I'm sorry.""
""Me too.""

*Emma woke up disoriented. She was in a bed, but not hers. Rob's? She vaguely remembered tears and hugs and drifting in and out of wakefulness. Someone had covered her with a blanket and taken off her shoes. Rob's room, yes. He was already gone, probably off on a morning walk. His bracelet sat on the desk, inches from her face, glowing faintly. So he wasn't close. Maybe at the gym, or getting coffee, but it didn't matter. Emma watched the red light slowly grow brighter. Quietly, with a sense of peace, she removed her own bracelet, dull gray as always, and left it on the desk. On her own wrist she slipped Rob's bracelet, and as it began to grow brighter, she straightened the bedcovers and left. *",0

"It's the job of our agency to keep track of the worlds monsters and keep them locked down. Which is complicated because people aren't allowed to know they exist or that they create them.
Fear itself, when amplified by a large amount of people, fearing that same thing enough...produces a monster to represent it, it simply comes to life and exists. We stop said Monsters from destroying us. We always do.
This time just over a decade ago, our job got a lot harder, a new breed of monster had appeared, and it was more dangerous than we ever suspected possible.
The thing about the old monsters is they're like the fear they represent:
Werewolves were simply animals, animals that stick to the forest, they're easy to explain to locals and generally don't even cause much trouble so long as they're left well enough alone, we picked off the aggressive ones and left the rest alone.
Vampires were a problem for a long while, because like the aristocracy they represented, they liked to lord it over people. To show off their power. Made it very hard to keep them a secret, but also easy to find them and destroy them before the fear they created spread too far. The few around today only stay alive because they don't act like the monsters they are, so it has been nightmarishly difficult to finish them off, but they're generally no longer our biggest issue.
With Modern medicine as it is, zombies went extinct long ago with the fear of disease that created them.
They weren't like one would imagine them though, they were slow and stupid sure...but also silent, they'd spread by bite, but not moan or be loud doing it. During the black death they killed as many people as the disease itself as fear of disease produced more than we were able to handle.
However now...a new monster has come about. We didn't even realize it -was- a monster until we captured one. Because they destroy themselves mere seconds after they pop into existence.
What much of the world knows as 'Suicide bombers', we found out their true form. So far as we can tell, there have been few genuine suicidal terrorists acts - 9/11 being the one that caused enough fear of terrorism to bring these monsters into existence. However now they jump into existence wherever there's enough fear and tension and after they die, they've left only more fear in their wake, leading to -more- coming into existence later.
So if not humans, what are they? Well. They have human faces, and hands...but the rest of them is anything but. Their limbs are made of some kind of shadow and their chest of fire - which when they release to explode and cause mayhem.
We only captured one after a brave marine tackled one to the ground - it would have made no difference, but in doing so he also accidentally starved the flames of oxygen -just- long enough to stop them becoming intense enough to remain, at which point the being became only shadow.
The creature is pitiful if it doesn't get to die soon after forming - the mask it uses to represent a face swiftly begins to rot, lasting only a minute at most the hands soon mold until they too are shadow.
And then...it just dies, it dissipates into the essence that makes up all monsters.
In a weird fit of irony, their purpose is the same as their fears creators - get as much attention as possible and use it to spread fear. And oh boy have they been doing so...we just can't stop them.
Because one can get over the fear of something that fears the sun, that only comes out on a full moon or is simply countered by modern medication.
If things get any worse, if we don't stop the media spreading the fear -and hence the monsters- we're going to have to fear a whole new ending to the world.

"Song: [Atreyu-Doomsday] (https: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=RdmOa8MhVoo)
(had a leg up here, as I often write to music anyways, so this was mostly already written) Had to edit some things to prevent spoilers since it's from a forthcoming work.
------
Sergeant Gregori Renfro's eye twitched. He wanted sorely to itch it or scratch it, but he was already strapped in. *S'not like I'd want to anyways, damn suit gloves aren't fit for jabbin in your eyes. * George hated the wait before a drop. It was their first, all of their first time. They had done thousands of simulations, dozens of training drops, but this was the unit's first combat drop.
As valiant as the locals were, he doubted they stood a chance without serious intervention. They would stand up for themselves, but were sorrily outclassed by the aggressors who had now set upon them.
But now the first squad, Weapons Platoon, 1st Mobile Armor Company, Vanguard Marine Corps was strapped into their four man drop pods, chambered like massive bullets into tubes four thru six.
It felt like hours since others in the company had launched. They were still awaiting their intel package to download. The whole mission was a rush job. Stonewater had them spin up the minute they left Sanctuary, the minute they knew the Kell fleet was headed for the planet Seggren, but they had to wait until they arrived to narrow the scope.
A light blinked on the display inside his hood and data began to flow into his suit's onboard computer. A screen materialized on the inside of his copula to the left of his face. The text WALON overlaid a topo-map for a few seconds before reducing to a corner. Translator data ticked along the bottom, along with minor cultural nuances. Streams of imagery began to show on a separate display to the right.
Gregori turned his head and sipped from his hydration straw giving him some added fuel for his pre-drop ritual. Taking advantage of the suit's waste system, he removed the pressure from his bladder.
Mentally, he tapped into the suit's communication node, ""Alright gentle-beings, we're –"" the pod slipped into its final prelaunch position, breaking Sergeant Renfro's train of thought for a split second. As the release clamps locked into place again, he knew the drop was moments away. ""As I was saying, we're about to drop and clear the way for Second Battalion to land. Target is an airstrip just outside Walon. Looks like the local Spaceport. We'll crashdown, in the city outside and sow some confusion amongst the enemy prior to. Full brief should have uploaded to your suits by now. Everyone read it? Any questions?""
Across his squad tactical panel, confirmation signals just below the status signals, lit up green signifying ""all good, no questions"". Then one shifted from green to orange, Lance Corporal Tiv denWildfur had changed his mind.
Gregori opened up the link, ""Yeah, Tiv?""
The Coloplfian cackled slightly over the squad channel, ""When can we get some burritos? I'm starving.""
Sergeant Renfro sighed, ""I don't think the locals have them, Tiv. You can sample the fare *after* we're done.""
A large ""10"" appeared centimeters from his face. It faded into a ""9"". *You know, sometimes I wish they'd just drop us rather than have the buildup of a count d–*
The acceleration of the drop cut him off. In the pods they were in zero g, free from artificial gravity. Upon launch, the systems did their best to create a limiting field effect around them. It cut the g forces to ten percent, but it still kicked like a mule. After a few moments, acceleration gave way to stabilized flight.
Gregori could feel the adjustment thrusters nudging the pod. Gently at first, the tug of gravity returned. Then the shuddering began, followed the main thrusters kicking in forcing them into an accelerated burn.
*Two seconds and…*
With a pop, bang, and a hiss the drop-pod broke into four tear shaped meteors, shedding a good deal of debris into the air behind them.
*Another three seconds…Need some music. Computer, play: * Atreyu-Doomsday. *Medium Volume, Auto-fade for incoming communications. * Gregori had taken a few liberties with regulations and coded into his suit a basic music emulator, but ensured that it would not interfere with his situational awareness by coding it in a manner that allowed the audio systems of the suit to override it under specific circumstances.
The speakers near his head began to build up a crescendo of throbbing guitars, just as the air around him exploded. Scattering behind him, the protective shell that held him flew away. Thin wisps of clouds buffeted him as he plummeted. He checked his readouts. Everyone was still green, everyone was now in free-fall.
He glanced left to see Corporal Trask, wrapped in his golem-esque synthsteel suit, falling like a skydiver. Each of the Mark II suits protected, enhanced, and empowered even the smallest Sat'ra. Variations on this model existed for each species in the Vanguard, increasing the size of the wearer to just slightly larger than a Kell. Obviously some variants had more mechanics than others.
Rushing up at him from below, the ground looked far from welcoming. Smoke and ruble ruined the symmetrical layout of the ancient city. It was the capital of the region and an important transport hub.
Music faded as he willed the squad comm line open, ""Breaking in five. Tiv you're falling to fast, break now. Everyone else…NOW!""
The music built into a symphony of anger as his boot and pack thrusters flared to life. Sergeant Renfro braced himself as he came crashing into the pavement on a foot and knee. The suit reacted in kind, allowing him to maintain his balance. His massive boot left a fifty centimeter long indentation in the asphalt.
Gregori recovered quickly and retrieved his Khamber-Five Enhanced Assault Rifle from its back-mounted attachment point. The K5 was designed for the larger fingers of the suit. Weapons Company normally carried bigger weapons than the K5 and would also be attached to line units in a much different manner. Today however, they were running like a standard Mobile Armor line Company.
Fading the end of the song, he called out. ""Sound off, Hellhounds."" One by one, the twelve other members of first squad responded. No issues yet. ""Adjust to me, wide diamond. Fifty meter dispersion. Remember the ROE. No locals, no matter what they shoot at you. S'not like any of it will make a dent, short of a tank. Watch your shots too, urban considerations.""

There's more, but that's the end of the song.
EDIT: A few stylistic changes.
I can post more, but only if /u/0ed wants it.",0
"The first punch gets me right in the ribs, knocking the wind out of me. I half-crawl towards him from where I fell on my ass, feeling the flush of adrenaline starting to take hold.
It's a dirty fight, I suppose. We focus on causing as much pain as possible - cruel to be cruel. He stinks.
********
The actual first punch was somewhat expected. The sun was hot, uncomfortably so, but we felt obligated to enjoy it. The ground in our neighbourhood was both more and less interesting in the summer. Deep cracks and canyons traced out a huge map that stretched from his backyard to the fabled danger-zone of the main road, but it lacked the fascination of living and moving insects, driven underground by drought.
What else could two boys do, but fight? It was fun. We laughed afterwards. We compared bruises for weeks; his turned yellow first.
If there was blood, I don't remember it.
We both of stunk afterwards. Of sweat and dirt and pure heat.

He's lost weight - or, rather, is in the process of losing it. The bones in his wrists are becoming visible.
It's summer again, not that you would know with the blinds so thick. They've trapped the air, and it's warm without any real heat.
Cliché, really, to be like this now. *He was such a nice kid...* Everyone was. Everyone is. I haven't reconnected, run into him on the street; people fall by inches.
He starts to cry. Not like in the movies. It's mostly snot (mixed with a little blood). Drool begins to gather at the corners of his mouth. I have to look away.",0
"Life feeds life. All living things feast on the lives of others. It is the way of the universe. It is possible to cultivate life, to let it grow, become a larger food source, which many do. So as they expanded and grew, they, too created life. It is also true that created life sometimes acknowledges this, and perceives their creation as divine. They devote their lives to appease this creator, but its their death which does so.
With each death, the creator is fed. It's all about how one cultivates the life. If unchecked, or done incorrectly, the food can rot, or even attempt to attack its creator. Some food even becomes parasitic, but it all turns out okay in the end.
This life will grow, and as it reaches the point of becoming too big to contain, then, and only then, will the growth be cut completely, and the creator can have a feast worthy to be called 'Divine. '",0
"Every time I turn around I see so much that should piss me off, and it does, but I'm just so fucking tired all the time. There's never a god damn reason to really get up and actually do anything about it. Every good and noble person working for the betterment of us as a species has a dozen people apparently unable to see beyond their own personal fortunes toiling to keep things fucked. Then I see you. You are such a god damn beautiful human being, doing these amazing things and improving the lot of everyone around you. Working twenty hour days every day for months on end and actually achieving good things. Then I look at myself, and holy shit. I'm so god damned mediocre it is disgusting. I'm smarter than average, but barely care. I have a good basic body type, but can't be bothered to get in shape. I'm fucking horribly lonely all the time and I can't muster up the god damned energy to do anything about it.
You show me what I could be, you show me the other option. I love you for it. I want your respect more than anything in the world. And I hate you so much it terrifies me.",0
"It's been some time now since I've been reborn. All the knowledge from my previous life as a scientist has been preserved inside my mind. The time machine, the laser gun, the weather-control apparatus, all of them easily re-created even with the simple materials to be found inside this home.
It is a harsh and sad home, however, and it's milieu of alocoholism and cheap, vulgar jokes is starting to truly drive me mad. How I long for my native England, and not this poor, uncultured American environment. My new father is an obese, irish-american fool with a drinking habit and a single digit IQ. My new mother, who I hate most of all, is a slobbering enabler, too weak to do anything about the deteriorating house hold. One day I shall have her blood on my hands and her death on my conciousness. My new brother is a compulsory mastorbator, just as dim as his father. The sister is a sad tale, constantly berated and verbally abused by the family, even though she has done nothing wrong but be un-attractive. I can see the glint of madness in her eyes after all these years without a single validating moment of interacting with a fellow human being. The only creature in this household I seem to get along with is the family dog.
But even after 13 seasons I just can't seem to get to that point where I can destroy them all. Everything seems to work against me, like there is some sort of divine force maintaining the status quo. If I shall ever achieve my goals and slay them all, my surprise will be almost as great as theirs. The last words they hear will be:
""What the deuce? Victory is mine!""",0
"I have to take someone with me when I go, that's the rule. Whenever I stop time, I need a companion. It's a weird rule, and one I don't really see that much of a point in, but it makes for an interesting time.
I tried taking people I knew first, friends, family, classmates, girlfriends, but the trouble was their brains just couldn't process it. During the time freeze they would either run off and do their own thing which they'd always wanted to do, or they'd go catatonic with shock and not do anything the whole freeze. That might've been alright, after repeated trips they would probably get the hang of things and we could have some proper fun, but the trouble was after the freeze they convinced themselves it didn't happen.
Some of them would claim they had been drugged by someone. Others would tell me it was all just a lucid dream. When I asked how I remembered the events the same as they did if it was just a dream they told me that they must have already talked to me about the dream and got so excited by it that I had one of my own. It's amazing how far people will go to maintain their perceptions of reality.
I had a problem then. If I couldn't take anyone I knew, who could go with me? There was no way I was letting this power go to waste, so who should I take along? After family I tried starting the freeze out with someone then ditching them. That didn't work, as soon as they were out of sight time resumed as normal.
Next I tried random people from the gym or the coffee shop, but most of those people either fainted or called the cops on me. Or called the cops and then fainted. I don't think the police had a complete description of me yet, so I stopped trying random people from shops.
This was really beginning to irritate me. I needed someone who I didn't know, but who had seen enough weird stuff that a little magical time freezing wouldn't completely weird them out.
That's when it hit me. I didn't think it would work. I mean, how could this not end badly? But I was running out of options, so I gave it a try.
""Hey man, I don't have any money, but I'd love to take a walk around the city with you.""
""I appreciate the offer friend, but you don't want to walk with me. People give the homeless weird stares.""
""Well you know, I might have just the thing to fix that.""",0
"""It's fucked. They have us at every turn and corner. Every fucking time we think we're close to pinning the source we turn up with fuck all."" This was the third time this week the chief was bitching without any glimmer of a purpose, and you could tell by his lack of creativity in profanities. Michaels and Johnson were already dozing off in the corner. They knew the case was useless at this point, despite the fact we were all as professional as the NYPD gets.
We had been working on the case for 4 months now without a single arrest, and everyone knew why- they we're smarter than us. Not your college degree type smart, or using fancy words smart, it was the 'leave you scratching your head while they steal your shoes' type smart. My work week has been typically chocked full of dead ends, empty warehouses, and not a single suspect - but last week something changed. we finally found a shipment of Hypolinium-synthobendol-diazaomortryptophen. We call it Linium for short - but the street name these days is Albert. It hit the market 6 months ago after 2 pharmaceutical scientists we're murdered and all their findings and research were stolen. Since then its been nothing short of a shit show. Murder rates are through the roof and crime is sky rocketing. I've seen homeless people in Ferrari's, millionaires reduced to pennies, strippers turn celebrities, and celebrities turn strippers- but now that I think of it I'm sure that part isn't anything new. Credit card companies and banks are failing because they can't encrypt anyones information fast enough, so 'smart' people are just stick to cash these days.
""Who the fuck has any fucking ideas? God damn it Michaels, wake the fuck up! somebody give him some fucking coffee.""
I chuck my half-empty thermos at his head. I watch it bounce off his forearm, skim his head and land on the floor.
""Thank you, Albert."" Chief mutters.
I don't bother speaking because I already know how this meeting is going to end. I'm drinking coffee now out of sheer habit, not because I need to. I had the Idea we all needed earlier this week, and since then I've had literally millions more. This is all just a nice display of formality, and I'll let them talk and feel better for it - as though they could get any closer to catching anyone. But they wont, not like this. See because before you try it, you can't help but wonder why such smart people wouldn't be honest and make money the 'right' way, use their intelligence to contribute to society, help create the sustainable world we all need...etcetera, etcetera, so on and so forth. But then you know. It all becomes clearer than all those empty warehouses. Being human becomes overrated. Morality is the steel chain that tethers the poor to the rich, the pathetic to the resilient, the dead to the living. It is weakness, a symptom of meaningless emotion, an outdated survival instinct that is now obsolete. I've lived my life with it as a driving force, guiding my every decision and action since my mother taught me to say 'you're welcome.' But now, now I can finally get to work.",0
"""Number 108, today's your turn,"" a voice rang through my skull as it shook me from sleep. I panicked; throwing off the sheet as I frantically looked around me for my clothes. My hands came into contact with a silky cloth, softer than anything I had touched before. A grimace formed on my face as I touched the sheer dress, grabbing handfuls of it onto my body. So this was it then; the day I would meet the king.
I bit back my urge to scream as the jailer tied my hands. Slaves took me from the simple room, leading me to a small bath chamber. They washed me meticulously, easing the dirt and grime out of my hair, vigorously scrubbing my skin. My skin became pale, and then flushed. Oils were rubbed into my skin. My nails were clipped and filed. My terror built as I looked for a way to avoid the confrontation, but I could think of nothing.
A pair of guards entered. Their faces and bodies were hidden by dark robes and curved blades hung at their waists. They waited as I adorned the dress and blindfolded me. A firm hand was placed over my own, leading me forward. I'm not sure how long I walked through corridors up a flight of spiraling stairs, but I was shaking by the time I arrived. I felt lecherous eyes probe me, confirming what the luxurious carpet and thick incense had made me suspect.
""They've certainly brought me a pretty one today. What's your name? Ah, it won't matter anyways, after tonight."" The voice hit me like rolling thunder, and I shook under its impact.
""M-my Great King… it's that time of month. I'd be b-b-better able to serve you in a fortnight,"" I stuttered. Cold sweat appeared all over my body.
The king roughly pulled off my blindfold, evaluating my face. The light stung my eyes and I blinked tears. ""I've killed a hundred treacherous girls; did you think none tried to lie to me?""
Suddenly rage filled my mind. I had done nothing to deserve this. I've worked hard all my life in the village, but I'm here just because of a Nobel's jealousy. I calmed my trembling and stared back into the King's eyes.
""Very well, off me if you will. There's a girl from my village, the Overseer's daughter. She is also a virgin, and is much prettier than me. Promise me, you'll kill her next!""
The king laughed; a single sound at first. The laugh continued, and before long he was gasping for breath.
""You won't be killed tonight,"" the King said as he spun around and fell into his blankets.
""Not tonight? Then am I…?""
""We'll see, we'll see.""
I laughed nervously as the bell chimed midnight.",0
"So what's going on here, Bob?
**Well, Dave, the aliens have rounded us all up and paired us off. **
What for?
**According to this brochure, they need human babies to breathe. So we can't leave until one of us gets pregnant. **
Oh.
**Yeah. Looks like we're gonna be here awhile. **
Shit. Did you bring anything to read?
**Just the breeding brochure. **
What's it say?
**"" Start fucking. We need babies to live. **
Anything else?
**Well, under that it says ""We need babies to live, so if you don't give us one you can't leave. But we --"" **
Wait! Do they know about the difference between the sexes?
**Well they flew here, enslaved our planet, rounded us all up, and gave us a brochure in English. That's more than President Trump ever did for our great-grandparents. **
Not really. Everyone got perms instead of health care. He said it was, and I quote, ""cheaper.""
**And smellier. **
True. Why do we still get perms?
**We've got plenty of time to discuss this while we're busy not having a baby. Maybe we can save that hot topic for later. **
*200 YEARS LATER*
Hey, did we ever talk about perms?
**Hurry up and get pregnant. **
Why don't you try for once?
**I'm shy. And you're impotent. **
How would you know?
**Remember New Years Eve about 80 years ago? I had those wine coolers? **
Well, how many people have you knocked up over the past 200 years?
**I don't know. **
Well, I can take a guess. Why do they keep injecting us with drugs that have us living this long?
**The wi-fi is out, and they say that we're the only ones left here. **
We are?
**Yeah, we were the last two people without female partners. The two odd men out. **
Wait, so they KNOW we can't make a baby?
**Oh, they don't need anymore. Turns out they don't need THAT many babies to live. Just like, you know, five. **
Five?
**Damndest thing, really. **
When did you find all of this out?
**That was the rest of the brochure. ""But we're cool, because a baby is born every seven seconds and we'll have you back home in a minute. Just promise us all you'll make more babies just in case. In return, here's a coupon for complimentary appetizers at Red Robin, and we're gonna keep the two leftover guys here because you don't have enough babies to fix our wi-fi and it would really be sick if we asked for THAT many. Besides, we're easily amused. ""**
Shit.
**Yeah, you should have let me finished. It continues, ""But if those two guys really don't wanna stick around, they have five minutes to leave. If not we will assume that they didn't read the whole brochure and totally get what's coming to them. ""**
Double shit. I really should have let you finish reading that brochure.
**Yeah. **

Aye, hey there Jenny! love what you're doing with your hair!
What up Dave! Yo we still on for brews this saturday? Excellent!
Oh, hey marcie I was wondering if maybe you wanted to grab some- Nope alright well a boy can dream.
Alright Wendell let's get to this meeting just a quick pit stop in the bathroom and we're set.
(walks into bathroom whistling goes to the nearest urinal next to a fellow Co-worker and begins to pee)
(to himself) Ahhhhh thats so much better. Oh boy thats a powerful stream I got going on, like wow, this thing could cut throw a metal door. Nice work Wendell you are one hydrated mother fucker! Is that Bob next to me? I think it is! Oh man! I wonder what he's thinking? Ya think he can even hear this godly vein drain? Course he Can! How could he not it's like a liquid jack hammer, I am so damn masculine it's ridiculous. I bet he's thinking, ""woah! Who's this Adonis and what have you done with Wendell?"" What's with this monstrous urinating giant? Nah, I bet he thinks I do this all the time. Yeah he definitely does. Maybe I should glance over, just for a second, see if he's sweating. Quick glance and I'm back.
(He breaks his forward glance ever so slightly to find Bob staring straight down at his penis,
he immediately returns to looking forward, horrified)
(to himself) WHAT THE FUCK, WHY IS HE STARING AT ME? YOU CAN'T JUST DO THAT! OH MY GOD WHAT DO I DO!? Okay just stare forward pretend he isn't there, oh dammit now the streams weak, he's gonna know I'm freaking out. SHIT I CAN FEEL HIS EYES BREATHING ALL OVER ME! Should I tell him to piss off? No that's way to much of a pun, damn you Wendell and your dashing good humor! …Okay okay okay, just finish finish and walk out…. (dribble dribble dribble) come on, come onnnnnn!!!!

SHOULD I TELL SOMEONE!? …wait…WHY THE FUCK DO WE NOT HAVE SOMETHING TO COVER THIS UP ON A REGULAR BASIS!!!!

"I stole the damn diary! I admit it! I had to! I needed it. I needed a place no one would or could judge me. A place where a part of me would surely live forever, even if the rest of me did not. That journal was a closely guarded friend and confidant. It knew me as well as I knew myself, and anyone who came in contact with it would know me, I'd made sure of that, I didn't just put blood, sweat and tears into it. I put my SOUL into it! And no one knows, not yet anyway. I put so much of myself into it, I feel as though I am a shell of who I used to be, not living or dying, merely floating along, existing. I want it back! Not the damn book! My words! My soul!
Don't you see?! I left a part of me in it's pages! A part I can't get back, I need to find a way to get that book back to where I got it from and to get that piece of me back. I fear I will do things I may regret, as if now, it would be easy to lose another part of me, and another, and another, and so on and so forth until I am gone and something else remains. What I don't know, however I am sure it will be less than human, but more than wraith...
I have to go, I'll hide this letter as well and hope someone finds it as much as I hope no one does.

"""Sadie! I told you not to stand under the tree in the middle of a thunderstorm!""
My mom frantically dialed 911, as I laid there, shocked. Literally.
""Hello?! My daughter was just struck- “
All of a sudden, something was wrong. I sat up, my fingertips crackling with this new power. Or was it the aftermath of the lighting? I couldn't tell. Nor did I care. No. Something was definitely wrong, and it was nearby.
""If I take 295 south right now, I can get to Home Depot in ten minutes flat. And then I can finally build that deck you've wanted, they have the planks on sale. I can feel it in my blood. Now, I know, they're plum colored and you did specifically say you wanted pine, but hear me out here. Plum is the pinest color out there, and you'd be a birch to say otherwise.""
My mom looked back at me, a hint of recognition in her eyes, but the rest of her face read as one emotion: terror.
""You know what else? I'm gonna get like, 50 windows from craigslist, they have the best deals, and make a greenhouse!""
Somehow, the words kept spilling out of my mouth. But something else was off here. Something with my house…
Suddenly, I knew. I felt my blood boiling as I continued to be filled with rage. I jumped up the rest of the way, and dashed the two blocks to my house, where my brother's laptop was.
""Not. Home. And his computer is plugged in. ENERGY WASTER! Doesn't he care about this house?! He could've burned the whole place down!""",0

"Claire discovered her ability when working on her first child.
She had worked on dozens of the deceased, but they all had either been elderly who died of natural causes, or middle-aged men and women who hadn't taken care of themselves as they should have. Yes, there were a few who died of accidents, but those who had died had lived long enough to get something out of life. To have their first kiss, first love, first fight, first everything.
But the little boy who laid before Claire, naked except for a paper-thin white sheet covering his genitals, he hadn't experienced anything except for the shit luck that the world had bestowed upon him.
""Oh God,"" Claire said, covering her mouth with one hand, and pushing back the flap of skin that had folded down from his forehead and covered his left eye. It was there, that his head must've collided with the asphalt. The rest of the family was fine after the car crash, but a faulty booster seat and faulty car door spelled doom for the three-year-old who wouldn't make it junior high, much less elementary school.
""Oh *God*,"" Claire said again, this time with a hint of anger in her wavering voice. If there was a ""God"", how in the hell could he ever let something happen to a child? Someone who was too young to probably even understand what life and death was?
Anger turned into rage, and Claire clenched her eyes. There in the darkness, she saw the Reaper, cloaked in the darkness of the insides of her eyelids, somehow managing to smile despite just being a skeleton in a robe, whispering ""I got this one, my dear, he is all mine, I will take care of him.""
Never in her short career did Claire feel such rage. She opened her eyes and removed her quivering hand from her mouth and clenched it into a fist. She wanted to punch something. She raised her clenched fist high above her head, and for a split second, almost brought it down onto the dead boy's chest. Claire stopped herself, though, a half-inch from the boy's sternum. She sighed, feeling warm tears roll down her cheeks. It felt like an apple had lodged itself in her throat and it hurt to swallow.
""Bullshit,"" she whispered, laying her hand on the boy's sternum. It was then that she felt a heartbeat.
She jerked a hand back and yelped as the boy's skin flashed. The scalped skin that was sagging across his face fixed itself back to the top of his head, and his eyeballs fluttered underneath his eyelids as if he were having a very vivid dream.
***
It didn't take long for her to realize that bringing the dead to life was taking it's toll on her. At the age of 27, she realized she was already starting to get wrinkles on her face. Her hair was thinning and turning grey, and it wasn't too much of a stretch to say that she looked older than her own mother.
But it didn't stop Claire.
Every single time she was presented a child under the age of five, she performed a miracle. Things became difficult when people started learning of the undertaker who brought the dead to life, and countless times Claire had to move and change her name.
But the funny thing about it, the more Claire performed these miracles, the older she became, and with the aging, came the changing of her facial features.
One year, it was a young woman who had performed a miracle in bringing a girl who had been murdered by a pedophile back from the death, and the next year, it was an elderly woman, resurrecting a child who died from an peanut allergy. It was hard to keep track of who was doing the miracles. Claire became Elanor, Elanor became Ruth, and Ruth became Gracie, and so on and so forth. Soon, she was just picking names from her favorite books.
***
Her last wasn't a child. No, for her last miracle, Claire brought back a mother who died during childbirth.
She had never brought back an adult before. Never even thought about it. She had dealt with dead parents before, but never once did she pull one out from the clutches of the Reaper.
As she laid her hand between the woman's cold bosom, Claire realized the reason she was doing it this time, was simply because she was tired.
She felt the last of her life escape her through the tips of her fingers, and Claire collapsed in the silent room. In her mind's eye, she saw the Reaper come for her, still smiling the same smile from the day she performed her first miracle, but this time, Claire smiled back.
*You take plenty from this world, I know you do, but it must sting to know I took some back from you. *",0
"""*ZEEEEEEEETAAAAA! *"" Yells echoed everywhere around me. Xera, the queen herself, was out looking for the girl, too. Well, I suppose that you'd assume she would look for her own daughter. Vengeance light up her eyes, and I knew that whoever had taken the princess would not get off very easily. Usually, when someone went missing, we would wait a day or two to see if they showed up. This time, the Guard was called immediately and a search was started. Someone had taken the princess, and that wasn't a petty, forgettable crime.
Ranging up and down the foothills, I could find no tracks of any kind. Quite literally, the kidnappers had left no trail. Possibly, they'd run off through the trees, but it seemed unlikely that they could do that carrying the 100 pound princess. Over every hill, there was nothing but the empty forest to greet me and taunt me. No signs of any disturbance. Moreover, the sky was beginning to darken, and the trail would go cold, soon. Lazily drifting, I plodded along the path until I found a tree that looked capable of supporting my weight and providing a comfortable night's rest. Kicking off my shoes, I prepared to climb. Just as I placed my hands on the trunk, I noticed a shining piece of fabric caught in a branch, higher up. Impossible.
Half excited, half scared, I climbed the tree. I observed the fabric closely. Gold griffins looked up at me, sewn into the fabric with an expert's hand. Feeling it confirmed that it was silk, and upon a moment's thought I remembered the design on the princess's dress. Excited for the thrill of the chase, I took off to tell the King I'd found a clue. During my reckless flight, though, I tripped and crashed into the ground. Catching my breath slowly, I stood up. Blood was everywhere, and I knew none of it was mine. At my feet was the princess.",0
"I knew I could not cook, but I did not sweat it. The door bell rang, and I was so excited. I opened the door and let my two gooey one eyed companions in. They were so glad that they did not even notice my baseball bat. I swung. They were mine now. All mine
The two alien awoke to ""gourmet"" jellybeans. They stuffed themselves, those crude idiotic blobs. Smiling they commented on how strange human customs were. That was quite funny, considering what I really had planned. I laughed at them.
Three weeks later, they were still strapped to their places and woke up, ate, then slept. Jellybeans were their every waking hour. They lived jellybeans loved jelly beans, breathed jelly beans.
On their ninth week they realized what I was doing, but they were powerless. I laughed at them as I broke their jaw hinges. Now they can't complain, so all was wondrous again.
By the next week they went on a jellybean strike, but I knew that would not last long, considering how attached to the food they were.
I broke their jaws, their life, their will. They were now truly mine.
Two years just flew by, my little companions were so entertaining. But the little trick was starting to get old. I grew tired, so I decided to spice things up once again. I starved them. Then, I told them the only way to get their food was to beat one another up. The winner would eat. However, that little contest would be way too boring, so I then sawed off each of their four legs. I then let them at each other. They sprang like animals, biting punching each other. It was a slow process, them having no legs and little energy. But that made it all the more worth while. I was even kind of sad when finally the weaker of the two was knocked out. I knew I needed more. So then, I spiced things up again. I told the still barely conscience one that in order to get his meal he would have to kill his best alien friend. He was shocked. I laughed again.
So, I prepared the murder for him slowly. I handed the syringe filled with black licorice to the victorious alien. The loser alien then woke up, only awake enough to see his own friend inject the deadly dose of jelly beans into his body. He died shortly, but boy was it massively entertaining.
The alien that was still alive cried, making inaudible noise for his jaw was broken after all. He demanded his jelly beans. It was not polite enough. His attitude was simply unacceptable. So I kicked him in the gut. I threw him against the wall and told him to be polite. HE WAS THEN KNOCKED OUT. HE COULD NOT PERFORM THE TASK OF ASKING NICELY. HE HAD TO BE KILLED AT ONCE FOR HIS BRUTAL MISBEHAVIOR.
Boy did I love that experience. But I would not miss it. It was a lot of work. Jellybeans are costly after all. I ate my dinner slowly, savoring every bite. Alien flesh tasted so good. I knew it was all worth it. Even though I could not cook well, I knew not to sweat it from the beginning. My plan had been a great success after all.
Did I write it correctly BookWyrm17? What do you think about it? I think I did it pretty well!

"The pitter-patter of little feet across the metal grating across the living quarters punctuated the otherwise dull hum of computers and machinery which, in-turn, punctuated the maddeningly monotonous silence of deep space. Sarah sat reading her daily reports, preparing for another shift in sick-bay. Her daughter Megan tugged at the corner of her purple robe, smiling up at her mother with the most endearing green eyes. Innocence was trademark, innocence and the faith of her mother.
""Mom"" Megan began, ""are we going to settle another planet today?""
Sarah turned and smiled but shook her head. ""Next week.""
""You said that last week"" Megan grumbled and turned to go back to her studies.
Hundreds of families across one hundred generations aboard one mammoth ship. A thousand years ago it was launched with the singularly simple goal of depositing a collection of humans on another planet to build a colony. Planet by planet, system by system the *H.S. Renewal* has visited a laundry list of exoplanets but each has been crossed off like items on a shopping list. One simple task had turned into the longest mission in mankind's fifty thousand year history. In fact the current generation of explorers could be called human in genetic makeup only. None had any first-hand knowledge of Earth or the Sol system as contact with Earth had been lost some two hundred years ago. It is unknown who fired the first shot but we do know it was the United States who committed to full-scale nuclear retaliation. Now the *Renewal* contains the only known surviving Homo sapiens. Survival the primary goal, education the primary means of attaining that goal. Survive, educate, populate; that is the motto of a faction of the refugees aboard that still believe their voyage ever had a mission. Another faction believe it as the last voyage of the damned, set off a thousand years ago by fools. Sarah styled herself a believer but James, her husband, fell firmly into that second category, known as *denialists*.
""Five-to-one she nails aces that chemistry test today"" James bragged as he sat down opposite his wife with his morning coffee.
Sarah giggled briefly, her eyes never leaving her reports. ""I just hope she passes.""
""Pass? She's been studying her little ass off for the past two weeks, she better do more than just pass"" James explained.
""I studied for almost a week longer than her and I barely passed.""
""A doctor that barely passed chemistry, only on this voyage of the damned is that possible.""
Sarah shook her head and sighed. ""I know you don't believe but I do and I asked you to keep that denialist talk out of our quarters.""
""No, you asked me to keep it away from Megan. She's buried in her chemistry textbooks, I could scream out chocolate ice-cream and she wouldn't hear me. Besides, at this point nobody would know how to start a colony even if we did find a suitable planet. We stopped educating builders with your great-grandparents and we stopped educating architects with their grandparents!""
""Damnit Jim, we have a ship full of engineers and materials scientists! Find us a planet and we'll settle it. I'll give you five-to-one on that!"" Sarah's retort was sharp and much less playful than her husband's tone.
""Okay, okay, sorry baby"" James sighed and composed himself again.
""I'm sorry too"" Sarah sighed herself and placed one of her hands gently on her husband's. This time she did remove her gaze from her reports, only to issue him a conciliatory smile with a duration of seconds before continuing her reports.
James took the hint and stood up with his coffee again. He straightened his uniform and stopped to kiss her on the top of the head before walking toward the main entrance to their quarters. He stopped one last at the threshold and turned half-way back to the dining table and his wife. ""We've got two mesoplanets and a thermoplanet to survey today, I'll let you know what we find.""
Sarah turned around in her chair and blew him a kiss ""find us a home.""
James chuckled, ""yeah, right. See you tonight."" He blew a kiss back to Sarah then turned again and exited their quarters.",0
"""You ready yet? I'm about to leave!""
""Yeah, I just need to find my keys in this mess.. Do you want to me to follow?"" She asks as she rummages through her purse.
""Yeah that's fine. Be careful driving! See you in a bit sis!""
I get in my car and buckle up. God I hate these drives now that we're older. There used to be a time when I could just pick up my little sister from moms and we can drive together, be there at the same time, not have to worry about traffic or work. But then again, there used to be a time before that...when my parents were together.
*sigh* Nothing we can do now huh.. Landon st. left and, what was it, Jefferson Rd right? I check the rearview more than the actual road. I hate driving. Damn, that new red mustang looks awesome...seems to be going a bit too fast too....

"The more I read them, the more they began to make sense. Theories on topics I formerly knew nothing about. The knowledge was coming to me in my darkest hours. Ideas that spit in the face of modern physics. Proofs the disproved decades old theories. They were all wrong. What I had could change the way we thought about the world.The way we interacted with the world. It could revolutionise transportation, medicine, energy, everything could change. I had to show someone.
I drove to Cambridge. To M.I.T. The best and brightest minds in the country. Surely if anyone could understand what I had, they could. They would take one look at what I had and fall to their knees in awe of the brillance. They would hoist me on their shoulders and make statues in my honor. But that's not what I wanted. I just wanted confirmation that what was happening to me was real. Information was flowing into me, my brain was working on a different level. No. They took one look and scoffed. Some wouldn't even look. I was dismissed over and over again. I thought that maybe the information was too complex to understand. I had to find someone who could understand, someone I could trust. I had to show someone.
I saw Dr. Hoffmanshire as I was leaving. Well, really, he saw me first. I looked up and there he was. His small eyes peering through his glasses, thick beard and corduroy jacket made him look like a stereotypical professor. He said the he was very interested at looking at my theories, and proceeded to pull them out from under my arm. As we sat in my car, he told me that these proofs looked different that anything he had ever seen. He agreed that this would change the world. Dr. Hoffmanshire was with me.
We proceeded to drive to other colleges, universities, lecture halls, coffee shops, anywhere where we could be heard. We were either wholly ignored, or asked to leave. The proofs were getting too complex. Dr. Hoffamnshire was struggling to comprehend the full scope of them; the implications. I still had a grasp on them, but I knew soon the complexity of it all would make them useless to us. Still we drove on. We knew eventually someone would listen to us.
Dr. Hoffmanshire was with me.
After a particularly heavy session, I awoke to a scene that I was not used to. Papers strewn about, piles of crumpled first, second and third drafts in a corner, equations stretching across multiple pieces of paper that have been taped together. That was what I had grown accustomed to. Not this time. A single stack of paper, hundreds of pages thick, sat before me. This was it. A Universal Theory. It tied everything together an simple and concise manner. From the smallest quarks the the entire observable universe. It all made sense. I had to show someone. Dr. Hoffmanshire was with me.
As we sat acoss from the panel of Doctors, we could see that they finally understood. We could see the look of shock on their faces as their reality came tumbling around them. Everything that they knew to be true had been wrong, some men's entire life's work had just been discredited. Some of those men were at this panel. They wanted to know how it was done. They wanted to see the process. I agreed, with one condition, that Dr. Hoffmanshire was with me.
They led us to an observation room. I told them what I needed. They agreed to bring me my supplies as soon as they finish asking me a few more questions."" How did I come up with these ideas?"" I explained that I wake up and that they are there. That I was just as curious about the process as they were. They asked if I thought Dr. Hoffmanshire was the one writing them. Of course not. I was the one who first presented the theories to him. ""Is it OK if I ask Dr. Hoffmanshire a few questions?"" I thought, ""What an odd question to ask me."" ""Go ahead,"" I replied. The man across from me asked ""Is Dr. Hoffmanshire with you?""",0
"Poseidon watched the coverage of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics from his underwater throne. Swimmers were warming up in preparation for the first medaled event, the 400 meter freestyle. The god kicked back in his seat, beckoning for his octopus-servant to bring him a pina colada.
""Make it snappy!"" he yelled, as the octopus tripped over his tentacles in haste.
On screen, Greek reporters were introducing the athletes. Poseidon drummed his fingers; he didn't really care about the identity of each human. He was more interested in the event itself—in the exertion, the sweat, the calories expended—all of which he lapped up as a sacrifice in his name. *It's not the same as when they slaughtered cattle for me, * he thought, *but for this age, it'll do. * Some of the less established gods, in fact, had all but withered into a wisps of their former selves. It was a fate Poseidon did not like to contemplate. He glanced at his sacrificial chalice, a massive, copper goblet with a long stem that was planted in the sand several feet to the right of his throne. Empty—for now.
As his octopus-servant brought him his drink, Poseidon returned his attention to the television. The reporters were introducing the final competitor, a chubby, middle-aged woman in the lane furthest from the cameras. Poseidon paused in mid-slurp.
""From the United States of America, we have Trisha Greene,"" the curly-haired reporter announced. ""Ms. Greene is the ‘ average athlete'for the women's 400 meter championships. She was selected by the Olympic Committee among several hundred applicants for this position. Ms. Greene describes herself as ‘ a mother of two who likes to lap swim at the Y.'She is also a big fan of Michael Phelps.""
Trisha waved at the dozens of cameras trained on the competitors. She blew a kiss, and launched into a vigorous stretching routine.
Poseidon spat out his pineapple rind at the monitor. As the half-eaten fruit drifted away (and the octopus scurried to mop it up), he stood up in outrage.
""What is the meaning of this?!"" he demanded of the monitor. He swam over to his magical chalice, stared into its pitifully empty bottom. Clenched his teeth, balled his fists. He pointed a finger in the direction of his weapons room, addressing his servant but without bothering to make eye contact. ""Fetch me my trident. I remind the humans the true meaning of the Olympic Games.""
///
In Tokyo, Trisha readied herself at the edge of the pool. She knew she stood out like a sore thumb from the actual competitors, with their well-built, youthful bodies. But she didn't feel embarrassed; she was doing this for her husband and two daughters, who were watching the broadcast back home in Newark. The Olympics was a family tradition, as the Greenes were an athletic family. After all, when Trisha had demonstrated her strokes in front of the Olympic Committee, they praised her solid technique, feeling that she would be the perfect example of the ""average swimmer"" to juxtapose against the elite athletes.
""On your marks—"" The referee raised his gun. Trisha braced herself; the roaring of the crowd dimmed in her ears.
BANG!
At the sound of the gunshot, all twelve competitors leapt into the water. Trisha focused on putting one arm in front of another, breathing bilaterally, but already from the corner of her goggles she could see the others overtaking her with torpedolike speed. There was no time for regret. Her mind went to that wonderful blank place, when the body becomes machinic in its execution of rehearsed movements. Up, under, breathe—
""In the lead we have…"" The curly-haired news anchor paused mid-sentence, squinting at the water from her position several meters from the side of the pool. As her jaw dropped in astonishment, her cameraman nearly lost his grip on his equipment, tripping over his own feet as he, too, strove to get a better view of the event.
The Greenes were watching the event back at home. Mr. Greene opened his mouth, and a few half-chewed kernels of popcorn spilled out and bounced off his younger daughter's head. She didn't notice.
""Is that… Mom?"" asked the older daughter, incredulous.
///
""Trisha Greene, in lane one, is, uh, in the lead…"" the anchorwoman stammered from the television screen. Indeed, Trisha was out-swimming the other athletes by a solid third of the lane.
Poseidon brandished his trident, waving it in front of the screen, following Trisha's direction and trying to get her to move faster. ""Piece of sh—"" In his frustration, he even tried breaking the glorified fork in half, but, though rusty and impotent, the trident retained its form. Nonetheless, the trident didn't exert the kind of power it used to. No, he'd need to get closer…
""Prepare the Vortex,"" Poseidon ordered his servant, who slinked away. The god grabbed his comb from the side of his throne. He brushed his beard, and swam over to the Vortex pad: a raised stone platform, encrusted with seashells and fossils, several meters from his television set.
The octopus lowered the lever. His boss shot up, through an opening in the palace, propelled by the massive force of the Vortex. As Poseidon disappeared, Steve the octopus let out a yelp of joy. He raised a victorious tentacle, and the other servants of the palace—seahorses, sharks, crabs, eels, mermaids and mermen—emerged from the shadows, joining him in jubilation.
Meanwhile, the Vortex carried Poseidon all the way to Tokyo harbor. He emerged, bedraggled but still magnificent, from the surface of the ocean. He grinned, revealing impeccable teeth.",0
"Alice crouched besides the moat and smeared mud across her face and hands. She had the pale skin of a northerner, and she would make an easy target beneath the full moon. When she was convinced that she would appear as nothing more than a shadow in the night, she unraveled the rope and hook and snuck up to the base of the tower, keeping her hand by her sword.
The tower watched over the valley – a lone unnatural structure in the forest. The trees and wildlife around the tower had already been corrupted, turning into mutated, twisted forms of their former selves. Even the tower itself pulsated with some dark energy. Somewhere up there, no doubt squealing like a little boy, was Prince Josef. But, more importantly, somewhere up there was also the wizard Zildread.
She tossed the hook up. It caught on a window and she began climbing upwards. Two goblins stood guard at the top, but they had both lapsed in their duties. One of them lay face down on the floor, the other snored loudly in a rocking chair. A large and mostly empty barrel of mead sat between them.
""Bloody drunken Goblins,"" she whispered to herself as she climbed through. Goblins had an amazing propensity for alcohol. She cut their throats and continued moving.
If she had any luck at all tonight, she would slay the evil wizard Zildread, who perpetually threatened the peace of the Valley, and satisfy her thirst for revenge in one swift motion. The wizard had brutally murdered her father, and she had tracked him across the realm ever since. Not only that, but if she saved the whimpering prince Josef, the king would pay her the prince's weight in gold. The feeble man wouldn't weigh a hell of a lot, as he was mostly bones and skin, but either way she looked at it, it was going to be a hell of a lot of gold. If she succeeded tonight, she would walk away not only a hero, but a very *rich* hero.
She ran upwards until she reached the tower's zenith. She waited outside the final door for a moment and drew her sword. She could hear voices on the other side. She kicked the door down and stepped in.
Zildread, crooked and hunched beneath his robes, looked up. His face twisted in surprise, anger, and fear. Josef, to her surprise, sat not in chains, but in a plush chair, a chalice of wine in his hand. He also looked far more cute and mature than he imagined.
From the look of things, she had misread the situation. And so had the king when he said his son was kidnapped.
""What the blood hell is happening here?""
Zildread lunged for his magical staff, the source of his powers, but Alice drew a throwing axe from her belt and tossed it. It nailed the wizard's robe, just missing his flesh, pinning him to the wall.
""Prince Josef? In alliance with Zildread? Somehow I'm not surprised. I'd just like to know why."" She leveled her blade at him.
""Very simple,"" Josef said. ""We're supposed to get married.""
The king stepped out from behind the curtain, as did a monk and Alice's own mother.
""I'm so sorry, dear,"" Alice's mother, the Dame of the North said. ""It was the only way we could get you to come. I know we got you to agree to the marriage, but you just kept not showing up every time we set a date. This was the only way we knew we could get you to be in the same room as him.""
""You look rather lovely,"" the King said, even though she was splattered in mud, gripping a sword, and ready to kill. ""Beautiful bride indeed.""
""Wait, so you set this whole thing up, so I could come save the prince so we would get married? This is a marriage ambush?""
""Really, dear, I think you go very well together.""
""And you came to save him,"" the king added. ""That means you must have some affection for him, deep down inside.""
""No! I told you! I'm living my life as a nomadic adventurer from now on! I'm going on quests, seeking treasure, you know! Doing stuff!""
""No need to get upset, dear,"" the Dame said.
""I think there's plenty of reason to get upset. And what about Zildread?!""
""Oh, yes,"" the King said, ""Almost forgot about him… guards?""
Two men with crossbows stepped out of the shadows and shot Zildread where he stood. ""Wait… what? We had a deal! You said if I helped you marry them I'd go free!"" The arrows cut him off and he slumped to the floor.
""See, kill two birds with one stone,"" the king said to himself, rather pleased with the way things were turning out so far. He had managed to convince the wizard to fall in his trap and he was finally getting Josef a wife.
But before any of them realized, Alice was already out the window and into the countryside, headed away from marriage and towards new quests adventures, the moon gleaming overhead.",0
"* ""Tonight: The war on Judaism intensify as radical extremists claim to be the new representatives for humanity, sent by God. Their leader, Jesus Christ, who claims to be the physical embodiment of God was arrested last week and found guilty of charges of treason and terrorism. We have the exclusive interview with Judas, the man who capture the known terrorist."" *
""You are about to enter the ‘ No Spin Zone.'The Factor begins, now!""
*Intro*
""Welcome to the ""O'Reilly Factor,"" I am your host, Bill O'Reilly. Indoctrination, that is the topic of this evening's Talking Points. As many Jewish-Americans know, Judaism has come under a lot of attack recently. The most notable example of this the new terrorist group led by a man who claims to be the ‘ physical embodiment of God. ’. As any faithful Jewish-American knows, God will tell us when he sends his messiah to save us. Despite this, many young people are being indoctrinated into believing this man's ideology. It is the opinion of Talking Points that a serious cultural shift is happening in this country. In the recent decade, we have seen the transition from a conservative middle class to a lazy and entitled youth. Talking points believes these kids have lost their moral ground, turning away from Moses and Abraham's message. The result? The blind devotion by some youths for a criminal living continents away, preaching anti-Jewish messages. America was founded on Jewish values; our Founding Fathers intentionally worded our founding documents as to imply Judaism principles as the moral and ethical groundwork for this country. This group is a real and serious threat, and Talking Points applauds the Israeli Government for their quick action in preventing this from getting out of hand. That is it for this evening's talking points.""
""With me now is Judas, the man who turned over the terrorist.""
""Judas, thank you for coming.""
""Thanks for having me Bill""
‘ Now, I understand you were once a follower of this terrorist. What was it about this radical man that finally convinced you to turn him in?""
""While my lawyer has advised me refrain from releasing any sensitive information pertinent to the case, I will say that this man was a possible threat to the Israeli people and the United States, but I also believe— “
""Now Judas, as I am sure you have heard, this terrorist has been sentenced to a very public execution to be taken place on Friday, in the form of crucifixion. Do you believe this to be a successful accomplishment of the judicial system? Being able to so quickly try and execute this terrorist? “
""While I believe that Jesus has broken the law, he has never harmed anyo— “
""So the judicial system was a success. This man was a terrorist, bent on destroying the West and American culture. He is filth that must be dealt with. If President Obama really wanted to solve the problem of violence in the Middle East, he would have already sent in ground and air forces to take care of this situation. Instead, he waited too long and now our children have been exposed and indoctrinated into this loon's ideology. “
""Thank you for being on Judas. Next on the O'Reilly Factor: Are terrorists crossing the US-Mexico border and adulterating our culture? Find out when we return.""",0
"I've told hundreds of people the same story. 'My father came at my mum with a knife in a fit of rage and I, ever the unflinching hero, got between he and she. The knife cut across my face before finding its way into her and then later into him.' I'd say 'Took me seven years to find where he was hiding, all that time holding onto the same blade. I wanted to see if he'd recognize it, if he'd even remember what he did to her. What he did to me.' I'd say- ever so carefully allowing a tear to well up in my eye while never falling. That's the key, you see. Get those pretty jewels in your face watery and everyone thinks you're strong for hiding so much emotion, and if you can keep it from falling they'll think you that much stronger.
I'd continue after a short pause, for dramatic tension of course, 'I found him and showed him the knife, the very blade that had freed my mother's lifeblood from her veins, and when I was sure he understood why this was happening I dug it into his neck.' On and on I've gone with story. It's a good story, I think, one of my best inventions. But you're sitting there with that same blade and so I think you know my tale goes no farther toward the truth than that name you gave to get in here.
Truth is my father did give me this scar, but not in hate, not in rage or in some moment of fury that overtook him and forced him to- no, he gave me this scar to remind me of what I'd done. Of what I always do: profit from the misery and hard work of others.
The first time I'd ever met my father was when I was five. My mother and he had had a falling out, and she kept me for her own without even telling him he had a son. She made money, you see, more than enough for her to feed and care for a son better than a some drunken tramp riding from town to town looking for an open bottle he could suckle on until the next train came in.
So when he left, like he always did, and she found out she was pregnant she let it be. Raised me and told me my father was dead. But he, being my father and I suppose yours as well, came back one day. In place of a bottle he carried a bible, convinced that the Lord above had granted him a second chance and that if he cared for his immortal soul he'd have to make up for everything he'd done wrong. Said he needed to make amends, make peace with the people he'd done wrong by.
But when he arrived at his former lover's house and found a child he didn't know what to do. Suddenly begging for forgiveness was begging for her to make amends. Said he realized he'd been a bad man and that he wanted another chance. Said he wanted to be a father for his son. For me. But my mother was not so forgiving, her memory long and unyielding. She told him that once I turned 18 it would be my choice, if he'd managed to stay sober that long, and that until then it'd be a visit every month. A letter for every holiday.
And that was really the last I saw of him for years. I got the letters, got a chance to hug him and be reminded that he wasn't ever really going to be there for me. He showed me pictures sometimes, of his darling family. Of his wife, my stepmother I suppose, and all my wonderful half-siblings. But still my mother would not budge. She claimed that living in that po-dunk town in a fancy house was better for me than having a father.
For five years I put up with it, until on the day of my 12th birthday I got a card from him rather than the usual visit (moments in time that had become rarer and rarer as my mother and Frank- a man who insisted on being called dad for the seven years I knew him- cemented their life with me as an only child). The card was a picture of him and you and all the other wonderful members of his real family having wonderful fun on a cruise.
So I snapped. Frank died first, and with his death came the first of my grand stories which would define my life to anyone that'd listen. 'He'd fallen off of a tall ladder but landed still alive, calling for help while bleeding' was how it went 'I went to get help, but by the time I got back he was gone.' My father actually showed up for the funeral, or around that time at least. Gave me a hug and said it'd all be okay. I remember being so happy that he'd come, and I felt that the affection he was showing me was because of that one story I'd told. That one elaborate tale.
On my 16th birthday I decided I'd had enough of living with my mother. I thought of many different ways to do it, all involving a story or another, but those stories would be hard to prove. My mother would be able to contradict any one of them. So after my birthday party, feeling sad and dejected because my father hadn't shown up, I grabbed a knife and sank it into her back.
Father, as it turned out, had missed his flight and been forced to wait for the next day. He walked in the door as my mother died. I was still holding the blade, shaking like a leaf. He saw me and I dropped it, I had no idea what to say, what to do, how to make it seem I was the victim, but I could see it in his eyes. He knew I'd done it, and I have to wonder if somewhere deep down he thought back to Frank, and knew I'd killed him too.
He rushed to my mother's side and, to my horror, she was still breathing. He tried to plug the wounds, but they were deep. Being young and not well versed in anatomy I'd missed the major arteries though, so there was a chance. He ran to get the phone, and I tried to figure out how to finish the job. Father ran back into the room to see me peeling off the crude bandages he made. He kicked me back, and as I lunged forward to try again he became enraged.
For the first time I saw a glimmer of what he must of been before finding Jesus. An anger dwelled within him that I'd never imagined, genuine rage that I'd only seen imitated in movies. He screamed at me, tears welling in his eyes, and pushed me back farther. Said he couldn't believe what I'd done, said I was a mistake that he should never have returned to. This, of course, just made me angry as well, and I grabbed the knife from off the ground and swung it at him as hard as I could, cutting open his arm.
He tackled me after that, and for a moment we wrestled. But I was a young man who'd never been in a real fight, while my father had spent a good portion of his life fighting just to survive. He wrangled away the knife and brought it down on my head, cutting open my face and leaving me on the ground screaming in pain. Through the blood and tears and sweat I could see him standing there, shaking with either rage or fear of himself. If I close my eyes I can still see him, tears in his eyes, but none of his cheeks.
Years later I hunted him down, convinced that if I could close that chapter of my life, the last vestige of the me that was real, I'd be able to forge my world anew. I imagined I could leave behind the real me, and live the rest of my days in my tales. Killing your father brought be no joy, just a shallow story made up of empty words. I don't know why I never thought that my brothers would have that same rage. That same fire that lived within me and my father for so long.
But here you are. Chasing after stories I've told. Stories from a man with a scar that sits for days in a pub, living vicariously through tales he can only wish were true. I'm not old, and I'm not ready to die, despite all my regrets. So think on this: if you come at me with that knife, you better kill me, because I could use another scar to explain.",0
"The paperwork required shouldn't have fit in a briefcase. Marie's feet clacked on the harsh lino floors, the fluoro lighting harshly illuminating her face.
""Permission slip for wearing a purple dress, sheer cut.""
Marie fished in her briefcase for the forms to let her get through the doors, her appearance forms. One for the bun her hair was currently in. One for the dark brown her hair was dyed, with a sub-form for the specific product she used. It just went on and on.
The man behind the desk stamped each form as slowly as possible, watching her with one eye, the screen with another. He clearly wasn't working; the screen was showing Facebook, the computer struggling to load the page on it's late-1990's hardware. He wasn't even trying to hide it.
After an eternity Marie's appearance forms were passed, and the form for her to be able to talk to Reynolds, as the man was called. He looked vaguely disappointed to have to accept her as she moved up to the second floor.
The next floor was for everything Marie wanted to take with her. Everything in her apartment was itemized, from the broken copy of Halo 2 to her Employee of The Month: April 2006 coffee cup, all carefully written out on the correct forms that had been stamped and re-stamped until they looked like a four-year old had tried to create art with them.
The enormous stack of paperwork landed on the table of the woman sitting behind the desk. Marie couldn't believe how long it had taken for her to get through the line. It had stretched around the entire city that had been built just for the office in fact, and she didn't dare leave the line even for a moment. Lucky she didn't need food. The woman pursed her lips, her grey hair bobbing as she reviewed Marie's forms. As the days passed and they moved from the living room, to the kitchen, to the bathroom, Marie gradually started smiling, and the woman started frowning.
""Fine, Marie Levesque! Take your damned forms!""
Marie smiled. ""Nice trap Nancy, but you need to re-write that one out as Marie Levesque-Hammond, or you know I won't pass the final floor.""
Nancy looked as if she'd like to turn Marie into dust, but instead muttered under her breath and re-filled out the form to allow Marie to go to the next floor. Marie thanked her lucky stars that that was an employee mistake and strode up to the next floor with her briefcase in hand.
The final floor wasn't designed like an office, with outdated technology and an air that made you want to jump off a building, if it wasn't so much effort to do so. This floor made you want to run and hide. The demon behind the desk wasn't hidden; he was eleven foot tall, with bulls horns and a scored red hide. Marie walked up to him with trepidation.
""Mervin, here are my Application To Vacate Hell forms, co-signed by another demon and stamped on pages 33, 179 and 812.""
Mervin reviewed the form. Marie sat down. This was going to be a *long* night.
It wasn't a long night; instead it was eleven long nights, the click of Mervin's pen and the crescendo of the lava behind them being the only sounds. Finally, he was done.
""Go. You've won. You get to go to heaven.""
Marie skipped up the steps, ascending a thousand flights of stairs as she headed to Heaven. Finally, she reached the pearly gates.
""Oh, a transfer? Hi Marie, I'm Peter and I'll be your guide around Heaven.""
""What form do I have to sign? A R4/82RD23? A 9T/HKO3?""
""No form, you just get accepted here.""
Marie collapsed to the ground, sobbing with the joy that her days of bureaucracy were finally over.",0
"""Water?"" he asks, a slight nervous chuckle escaping his lips, ""You can control water?"" I smile, he thinks he's saved. ""You can't hurt people with water. What are you going to do? Splash us to death?""
He thinks that because I don't have a weapon, because my great power is hydrokinesis, that they're safe. But they aren't safe, these are the kinds of people who spent years, decades mocking me because I couldn't manipulate earth or fire, I couldn't lift buildings or call down thunderstorms. Just water, good ol' H2O, what could anyone do with water? Not everyone is born with superpowers but out of those of us who are, I was born with the useless one. I couldn't be a superhero with water. They broke me down, they cast me away like trash because, at the end of the day, I'm too different to live a normal life and too weak to be a hero. But now who's laughing? Water is patient, in weathers away at mountains and creates vast canyons, it breaks down human achievement and one wave can bring entire countries to their knees. Most of all, water is life. 70% of the Earth is water and 60% of the human body is water. I can control 60% of every single human on this planet and I can make them scream.
It started off small, rodents and household pets that I could torture and break. So small and defenceless that they never had a chance to fight back, at the end of the day that is all these people are, rodents that walk on two legs. I can still hear them laughing, all of them, even now as they sit here before me, they're laughing at me. I can see it in their eyes, they don't fear me, they think I'm weak, they think they're safe. They think that once they're in school, hidden behind their walls and cowering behind their teachers, that they're safe from me. But this was the perfect place to begin, I will make the world understand who I am from here. I will climb over their broken corpses, their mutilated remains and I will watch their world burn.
He's still talking, laughing and mocking behind his eyes. Or is he. Did he even open his mouth in the first place? Wait...who IS talking? Am.. I....? No. They're still laughing at me, everywhere, all the time, all around me, echoing through the hallways and classrooms. It is time they learnt who I really am. I raise a shaking hand towards one of the teachers while staring out into the crowd to see that maniacal laughing turn to dread. The first thing I see of it is the puddle that begins to form at his feet and spread out across the floorboards, the wave of people trying to get away from the horror unfolding before them. Finally, I look towards him and gaze upon my handiwork, water is dripping out of every orifice and hole in his body. Small waterfalls falling out from his eye sockets, mouth and nose and cascading down to the floor. His screams begin to echo out from the back of his throat and through the chamber as his skin dries up and his body starts to shut down. Eventually, his body falls to the ground and he lifelessly lies there in the pool of water, urine and blood that has formed on the floor. They stare at him silently for a second before all hell breaks loose, students and teachers sprinting everywhere in a desperate attempt to escape, some trying to push past me and many going down like their professor. Another few suffer the instant dehydration, I drown others, one or two explode in blood as I punch through their skin with the water.
I stare at the corpses, spread out all around me, their blood and water creating a small lake throughout the hall. For just a minute, I hang around and just enjoy the carnage I created, sirens ringing in the distance as the police rush to try and stop me. They'll learn soon enough that they can't stop me, they're going to need much more than guns to stop me now. This is a world filled with heroes from New York to Japan and everywhere in between, it turns out that I'm the villain.

"""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned.""
The priest sighed. ""You do know I can recognize your voice."" The screen divider slid aside, and the priest shot an annoyed look at the confessor.
She flashed a toothy grin, and reached out to close the divider. ""Come now, do your job.""
""Ten Hail Marys, ten Our Fathers.""
""Hey, you didn't eve-""
""We're done here."" The priest stood from his seat and hurriedly exited the confession room, slamming the door behind him.
""H-Hey, hold up there."" The girl stumbled out of her side of the confession, almost faceplanting as she made her way to the priest's side. She reached out and gave a pointed tug upon the priest's shirt, untucking the entire back. ""Can we just TALK for a minute?""
He whirled about, quickly wrenching his shirt from her grasp, teeth clenched. ""I am WORKING right now, Tessa. Have you NO shame?""
Tessa recoiled somewhat, a look of uncertainty flashing across her face. ""Johnny, I just..."" She looked down at her feet, shuffling about in place, her cheeks flushed in embarassment. ""I'm sorry, I just thought that I should...you know...""
""It's been almost five years Tess."" Johnny sighed to himself, and began tucking his shirt back in. ""Why now?""
""Well, Brian and I just got back from his stint overseas, and I-""
""How is Brian? Good?"" Johnny snapped off curtly, idly fiddling with his collar.
Tessa paused at the sharp tone used, but eventually nodded, a small smile playing across her face. ""Yeah, we're doing great. We think he's gonna get a station at home, so no more travelling, at least for a while."" Her smile quickly faded. ""Johnny, we didn't hear about it until he had already deployed.""
""It's whatever. Long in the past."" Johnny turned and continued walking through the near empty church. ""I've heard it all, and I've made my peace with it.""
Tessa fell in slightly behind him, nervously biting at her lip as the two proceeded along in silence. Finally, ""I...got your letter.""
He paused in front of a door, hand resting on the handle. He stood there a while, as though quietly digesting the revelation, before turning the knob and stepping through. ""I need to change,"" he mumbled, groping around for a light switch.
Tessa stepped through as well, closing the door behind her. ""Can we just talk for a minute?"" Her eyes widened a bit when she noticed Johnny had taken off his shirt, and she looked away, suddenly intent upon studying a nearby cross. ""Are priests allowed t-""
""There's nothing here you haven't seen before."" Johnny stiffened up as he felt Tessa run her hand along his neck.
""I haven't seen this before,"" she whispered, her fingers tracing the pale scar that encircled his neck. She lingered a bit, before slowly wrapping her arms around his waist, pulling close. ""Oh Johnny...why...""
He could feel her tears trailing down his back, and rested his hands upon hers. Gently, he freed himself from the hug, and turned to face her. ""It was five years ago, Tess. I'm fine now.""
""I...I read it, Johnny. Your...goodbye."" She looked up at him, eyes red and shimmering in the dim lighting. ""Oh Johnny, why didn't you just say something...""
""I was just being dumb. It doesn't matt-"" Her slap rang out sharply in the cavernous room, and he reached out to touch his reddening cheek, a look of shock playing across his face.
""Don't you pull that shit with me, John. I've known you and your brother for too long for you to start with that dismissive talk.""
John sighed, and turned towards a nearby closet. ""If you would just go now, I need to get rea-"" He could hear her rush forward, and whirled about, catching her hand mid-swing. He lifted her, somewhat roughly, and shoved her against a nearby wall, all the while keeping his eyes locked with hers. ""Stop. That.""
She lashed out with a foot, trying to kick him in the shin, but felt him use his leg to pin hers against the wall. ""Fuck you John, you TALK-"" She swung with her other hand and landed another slap. ""-to me!"" She made to swing again with her free hand, but Johnny hurriedly grabbed it and pinned it above her head with her other hand.
""Behave yourself,"" he growled, leaning in until their noses were almost touching. ""Calm down, and don't try that again.""
They stood there for a while, saying nothing. She could feel his raising pulse, the slight tremor in his grip, his breath against her face. Slowly, she leaned up, and gingerly pressed her lips against his for a moment. ""Johnny...could you let go of me..."" Her eyes widened as she felt his body press firmly against hers. ""Johnny?""
He said nothing, leaning down for another kiss...
---- ----- ----
...They laid there for a while, quietly soaking in the silence. She rested her head against his chest, slowly tracing her finger along his scar, listening to his breathing, to his heartbeat. ""I'm sorry Johnny.""
He shook his head slowly, eyes fixated upon the ceiling tiles. ""I was just being dumb.""
""You could have told Brian. Told him how you...felt.""
He laughed softly at that. ""You know my brother. What he wants..."" He rolled onto his side, gently shifting Tessa off his chest, and lightly kissed her forehead. ""Besides, you two were always thick as thieves.""
""...Still, Johnny...I just wish that you had just told me...""
He smiled, somewhat wistfully. ""Would that have really changed anything?""
""...""
His smile slowly faded, as the silence grew...

"When the bullet cases had come to a rest and the glass had finished breaking and the screaming had finally stopped I found I could then take a deep breath. The smell of the room was beginning to settle into something that seemed normal to me.
The dead body by the counter had reeked of bleach when it was alive. Bleach that was only just covering up something worse. He had laughed when he hit the old manager in the face. Her pine smell remained strong so I knew she was still alive. I resolved to speak to her again so I could place myself within her scent and let the forest she carried within her odour wash over me.
Despite the pain in my left shoulder I found I was still able to lift my gun as I stepped out of the booth. The whimpering around me grew quiet for a moment. I could hear someone on the phone to what I presumed was the police. He smelled of board pens and stationery. I knew he wasn't to be feared.
I moved around the shattered display case and saw his feet. He had propped himself up against a wall. The delivery man outfit he was dressed in showed the bullet holes and growing blood streaks. He was young, with sweaty blonde hair matted with blood. On a normal day he would have been ignored as a nameless worker passing by on the street. But that smell of his made me reel.
He smelt like something which lies behind the door at the bottom of your darkest nightmare. A smell of loneliness and terror. I lifted the gun briefly but then lowered it again when I saw the flow of blood from his wounds and spluttering, saliva flecked mouth was increasing. His stench stayed the same, relentless and indifferent. It would go when he died but for now it held itself around him.
He was mouthing something. I leaned in as close as I could but could only hear what sounded like the ravings of a man who was dying badly.
""Across the bridge, in the canyon, to the mountain and the field, to the house with the chair, to the house with the...man"".
""Get your hands in the air!"". I should have been able to smell them coming but so close to the dying man I had not heard them arrive. Their smells came in with them now, smells of stale bread, gaslights and cooked fish. One or two smelled bad and in their uniforms I knew I could not deal with them now.
I held my hands as high as I could before two officers cuffed me. One smelt like balloons and paper plates whereas the other smelled of engine grease. I closed my eyes in tiredness as the other diners slowly stumbled out onto the pavement.
The door chime sounded again as a new person came in. She stood in the middle of the cafe and I could feel the other police officers begin to defer. But as much as she carried her authority well she lacked something else entirely and the lack of it was almost enough to make me forget the nightmare smell which sat before me.
She didn't have any smell. Not just smelling clean or fresh or antiseptic there was just nothing. It was neither feral nor luminal. It was nothing at all. She turned to look at me and in that moment I could sense I might lose everything.
""Clear the room, I need to speak to this man alone.""",0
"I questioned my choice on that first day, and on several subsequent days. By the time summer came around, I was enjoying it of course. But then autumn came again, and fat clouds brought more questions.
I always walked my section of the Thames, never any other, not even on my own time. The filthy serpent that snakes through London had never interested me, and still doesn't. I passed through Rotherhithe Docks and paused, the rain falling around me in sheets, splashing off a nearby awning with a roar. I recall this now, because it was the last good day. Every day since has been horrific due to my own curiosity.
The other Regulators had said not to ask questions when I transferred over from the Environmental Department. As far as cushy government jobs went, this was the best. So secretive, you can't even tell yourself what you do. Just stand out in the rain with your clipboard every time the heavens open, and record all 'strangeness' you see in the waters. Post the form in the box and go home.
Some days, like this day, the wind was not strong enough to move the mist from the murky surface, and it made it difficult for me to see the eddies. Never get too close, they said. I stared at a dark twist in the current and hunched deeper into my raincoat. I checked boxes on my waterproof sheet.
I saw Ben Thompson slowly go mad. That was when I had first begged my superiors for the answers. They laughed as if we were sharing a joke but then threatened my job, and I have a family. So then I asked some of the other Regulators, even though I knew we were not supposed to fraternise outside of work. Blank faces and sullen looks. These folks knew their ebb from their flow, but never more than that. Just like me.
I threw my legs over the barrier and landed knee deep in brown slime. My hood slipped and my hair immediately plastered to my face in the deluge. 'Never get too close, they said', I murmured as I waded to the water's edge, past sunken shopping carts and drowned sea birds.
Never get too close. Never ask questions. Two rules, both broken. I learned that when you see it for the first time, you will always see it. The clamour beneath the chaotic surface. Dark shades of fingers and translucent twists of limbs. The long dead fighting for a return to civilisation. The rain brings them up like worms, out of their watery graves. Gasping for air but never quite reaching it.
Since that day, I see them. And the London rain stinks.",0
"The general entered the room, ""where is He, where is the child?"" He demanded.
An attractive young woman approaches him with an ere of caution.
""Please sir, He is sleeping.""
""I don't care! That...thing, is a weapon. A powerful weapon.""
He storms down the hall to the Pope's Vatican apartment. He proceeds to break down the down first shooting the lock, then to the bedroom. Inside the woman runs over to embrace the child on the bed. The general advances, but the Pope gets between them brandishing a jeweled scepter.
""This child is no one's property! He is the Alpha and the -""
""Oh shut it old man. This thing is the key to military superiority! I'm giving you one chance.""
The Pope lunges as much as his old body can at the man in uniform, but before he is half way to him, he is shot by the general's sidearm. He looks to the boy in His virgin mother's arms, ""Please forgive me....bleh....""
The woman lunges with a hidden dagger, only to be brought down the same.
""Hello Elohim. Do you want to come with me? Do you remember who I am?""
The boy, maybe 5 years old, gets a crazed look of fury and bares His teeth at His mother's murderer.
""4 star general Luke Beezle.""",0
"The radio crackles to life, and Chopin is on.
""Don't turn it off,"" Jane says. Henna flinches, and her hands retreat back to her lap, where a plastic bag full of oranges sits. ""It's fine.""
""Oh. Well. Um. Would you like an orange?""
""Alright.""
Henna reaches into her back and pulls on out, meticulously picking off the sticker. Chopin quiets, but then surges forward again. Henna hums along until she hears Jane take in a deep breath.
""When I dream, I have two hands.""
Henna's hands halt, fingernails digging into the skin of an orange. She looks, for a moment, desperately to the radio, but the piano offers no answer.
""You still do,"" she says, finally.
""Working hands,"" Jane replies. ""They move, and I can play again.""
Henna's fingers drift away from the half-crushed orange, juice trickling down her hands in shiny, sticky rivers. Between them, the citrus aroma rises, almost overwhelming in its sharpness.
""Oh,"" Henna manages. Her voice and smile waver with uncertainty. ""Well, the doctor said that you might improve, right?""
Jane doesn't say anything, but she looks forward, and then down to her hands. The callouses on them are fading, tough skin fading back into softness. Her eyes shut, lashes curling against the curve of her cheeks.
""Yes,"" Jane says, finally. Her voice is low beneath the piano's thunder and the incessant static that crackles over it. ""He did.""
Henna's smile tightens so it stops trembling, and she pulls another orange out of the plastic bag and tentatively peels it. Carefully, she holds a piece to Jane's lips, and watches Jane's lips close around it. Then, Henna pops another one into her mouth. For a few seconds, the two of them chew.
""It's a little sour, still,"" Henna remarks. Jane briefly looks to Henna's face, and then back to the wall, and swallows, the action casting deep shadows onto her clavicle.
""You know, you don't have to smile for me.""
Henna ducks her head down and looks at the oranges, half-crushed and healthy, sitting on the plastic.
""It's not for you,"" Henna says, finally. Jane watches her push the two oranges back into the bag and stand up. Like always, Henna doesn't slam the door, because she's polite, but she leaves no room for it to open again.",0
"It was the very first time I'd ever flown.
The excitement before takeoff was palpable; you could feel the electricity in the air. My fellow travellers were just as excited to go as I was, I could tell.
I felt the engines power up, and soon enough they roared to life, shooting us upwards, gracefully into the sky. Before long, we were soaring off into the azure blue frontier, passing by birds, rushing through fluffy white clouds. Below, the city shrunk rapidly, its inhabitants shrinking to the size of ants, then specks.
I had waited my whole life to fly. I'd never had the opportunity before now, and as I sped through the air, I was exhilarated by the sheer incredible speed. It was a pity that the flight had to be as short as it was, but that was something well beyond my control.
After all, an ICBM only takes 30 minutes to reach its target.",0
"Crummable.
*What a crummy word* she thought, pulling the sheet off the word-a-day calendar.
""Definition: Capable of being crumbed or broken into small pieces,"" she read aloud.
She smiled, laughing to herself at the odd word. Craig would have liked it.
Just like that, the smile slipped off her face and her good moon crumbled into small pieces and fell to the floor. She put the calendar carefully back on Craig's desk and dropped yesterday's word – Successful – into the trash bin beside the filing cabinet. The clear mesh can held nothing but square pages ripped off the calendar, each one a crummable reminder of a day since he'd been gone.

"Yeah, my childhood was pretty normal. When Adam was born it took some getting used to the fact that I'd be getting less Christmas presents, but I loved my brother from the start. My father was an architect and my mom was a high profile defense attorney. They both worked long hours, but they made time for us whenever they could. Oh yeah, we had a babysitter for a few years there that I slowly figured out never aged. She was perpetually sixteen years old. It was pretty weird, but I got used to it. I had the biggest crush on her. Anyway, in high school I ended up playing varsity badminton. Adam played the tuba. I graduated with decent grades and now here I am in college following in my father's footsteps.",0
"It was a war for survival. There's no other way of putting it. It would either be us or them.
The lymph nodes had been filled to capacity between us and our foes. The heat of battle had rose to a fever-pitch and we both knew this would be a final stand. Many of us had been ambushed and overrun by some of their first sorties into our lines. We knew the stakes just as much as they did. Life; mere existence on the line.
Eventually, it came down to one-on-one contests. I found myself separated from the rest of my squad. I would have to sneak deep into the heart of the enemy's defenses to have a shot at taking over this territory. I sped quickly through main thoroughfares, slid between cracks in walls, tried to blend in with the locals as I worked my way closer to the goal. That's when I was spotted. A lone soldier of their patrol took a glance my way and began pursuit. There was no running now, I'd have to fight my way out.
He tried to stun me but his gun jammed. I struck while he checked his gear and sent him sprawling. He sprung back up and slammed a knee into my mid-section. I made a grab for him and took him to the ground with me. We rolled back and forth, striking whenever either could get a limb free. He pinned me to the ground and started raining a barrage of elbows into my head. No matter how much I tried to guard my own arms, damage was being done. As a last ditch effort, I dropped my defenses and gouged my thumbs into his eyes. He screeched in pain but rose from his knees to get away, giving me enough space to bring my legs up into his chest and kick him clear. He tumbled backwards into a wall and stayed leaning against it as I rose to my feet, still doubled over in pain.
""You're too strong for this system, punk. Why are you protecting them?"" I yelled at my foe. ""You know no matter what happens here, whether you beat me or not, eventually we'll take this sector, and everything else with it.""
""I was born here, raised here, specialised here, just to take you out. You think a few words and a little pain can turn me?"" he yelled back.
""Gave you a chance to make this easy..."" I snickered. He let out a primal scream and rushed me once more. Letting him close the distance, I slipped the syringe from my pocket and jammed it straight into his core, letting the chemistry go to work. He stood there stunned as I watched the last of his will drain out of him. He fell to his knees clutching his chest, supporting himself on one arm. As quickly as he had begun his fit, he stopped, rose to his feet and faced me.
""What are your orders, sir?""
""Take the lymph nodes. When you've secured the area, re-group with the rest of us in the brain,"" I slipped him two syringes, ""convert as many as you can.""
""Yes, sir.""
Survival. Many against one. It was either going to be us, or the human.",0
"[I'm a little rusty, my apologies.]
Of all the bouncing heads I observed through the doorway of Ms. Claudeo's classroom, Marcella's was the only face I saw.
As usual, I was waiting for the noise and horde to thin out before I went to my next class. I hate when people touch me, tease me, or rub their elbow against my own. It makes the back of my head hurt.
And as usual, Marcella took notice of me standing sheepishly near the doorway, and nodded to me with the faintest hint of a smile. She was the only one besides Lou, who moved to a school with a better autism support program, who ever smiled at me in school. I liked that about her.
Bub stood from his desk, walked to stand next to me. ""What are you doing?""
I turned to look at him, meeting his eyes for a second, before deciding that it would be easier for me to just look at his nose while we talked. ""I'm standing here."" I said.
""I mean,"" he had the deepest voice I'd ever heard, ""why?""
I looked at his shoes. They were green, black, and white, and had a picture of Michael Jordan's silhouette on the side. They were shiny. Mostly, they were weird. ""Your shoes are weird."" I said back.
He laughed. ""Your shoes are Velcro.""
I'm not sure why he said that. I think he meant ""normal"".
I glanced at the doorway again. Now there were only stragglers. ""Well, I have to go."" I said wryly as I walked out of the room.
I made a left. Thirty-five linoleum tiles later, I made another left. Twelve linoleum tiles later, I was at Mr. Nancy's class. I walked in, shuffled to my seat, and set my backpack down. I loved Mr. Nancy, even though his last name was a first name, which was a real problem for me at the beginning of the semester. *What is his wife's name? *
I'll remember, always, the day that Mr. Nancy was telling us about King Xerxes, and I raised my hand to ask what his wife's name is. He laughed for a second, as did the rest of the class. ""It's Faye,"" he chuckled, ""Do you have any questions about Persia?""
Faye Nancy. Finance—y. Nonsense words.
Anyway, on this particular day, Mr. Nancy was talking about the Meddicci family and why they were so important, and I was busy staring at the back of Marcella's head because half of it was freshly shaved, and I was feeling a mix of *please-let-me-touch-it* and *why-did-you-do-that*.
And when Mr. Nancy said this: ""So let's all get into groups,"" I was very, very busy wondering what I had missed, and worrying about my group.
The room turned into a beehive for a moment, alive with the buzzing of excited students forming small alliances. I did not move. Mr. Nancy came to my desk, leaning down to ask me quietly, ""Are you okay with that?""
I stared at his shaved head, much more naked and shiny than half of Marcella's head. ""Groups?"" I asked back.
""Yeah,"" he said, ""Do you want to go to Mrs. Ray's room?""
Mrs. Ray is the special education teacher who gives me answers on every assignment when I feel stressed. I don't think she's supposed to do this. She may have thought I was stupid.
Mr. Nancy spoke again, ""Or is there a particular partner you'd be comfortable with?""
I said quietly, ""Marcella.""
He nodded, smiled, clapped his hands as he walked to the front of the room, behind his desk. ""Alright, guys,"" he bellowed, ""Sorry for the confusion, but these are assigned groups.""
Everybody groaned.
He broke up the class like teachers do: separating Steve and Andrew because they were so loud together, making sure that Jayme and Nika don't sit too close together because they tend to get distracted, and, finally, assigning me and Marcella into our own team.
Marcella looked at me and patted the seat next to hers. I came to her and sat. She looked at me in the eyes and I stared at her nose instead. ""Sara, do you know what we're supposed to be doing?""
This brought out a panic in me. I felt my face get hot. ""Being in a group?""
""I mean, like,"" she laughed. ""What are we doing in the group?""
I was silent and decided to smile so that she didn't think I was weird.
She let out an even bigger laugh and said, ""I don't know either.""
She turned her head and began to text under her desk. I stared at the shaved side of her head.
""I like your bald head."" I blurted out.
She looked at me. I don't know what face she was making, but it made the back if my head hurt for a second. Then she smiled and said, ""Thank you,"" only she said it like it was a question.
I wanted to tell her that it made me happy when she smiled at me in the hallway. I wanted to ask her about her piercings. *Did they hurt? * I wanted to look at her shoes. Then, I realized, I just wanted to be able to make myself say *anything* to her.
After 15 minutes of her playing with her phone, she turned her chair to face me. ""We have to look like we're doing something."" Then, she swung her mouth to the side before asking me, ""You have a good weekend?""
""Did I have a good weekend."" I corrected.
""Did you?"" She asked.
""Did I what?"" I asked back. The back of my head hurt.
She stared at me quizzically. *Ow ow ow*.
I stood, gathered my backpack, and walked back to Mrs. Ray's room.",0
"*Dear God*, I thought as the removed submission notification appeared. My test… it had worked. This theory, this crazy theory...
I had been gathering data for weeks, prowling rising threads, monitoring new comments and recording the ones that were deleted. It had started when I noticed that Reddit seemed…different. I couldn't say what was different or what made me notice it but it was like walking into my flat and sensing, more than seeing, that something was off. Like something had been moved, but only slightly. *That* had been happening more often too.
A sensation of being watched had started scratching at the back of my neck. At work, everything seemed fine. I didn't get the strange sensation when I read the news or went to the bar with friends; it was at home that the phantom eyes stalked me, where every noise in the pipes and every shape in my peripheral vision almost made me sick with anxiety. Even the damn cat made me jump out of my skin.
I had never been a paranoid person but this time there was some icy, primal sense in my gut that overrode my usually laid-back nature.
I started watching over my shoulder, changing the route I took to work, getting the bus some days, trying to anticipate and break any patterns before they formed. I didn't sense any followers. I changed the locks, installed alarms and cameras but nothing showed up, just Jackson's sleek black tail flicking as he idly batted at the cables.
I felt unsafe. I couldn't relax. I couldn't sleep. I could barely eat. Fear had its sharp claws sunk too deep into my mind. That's where Reddit came in. Monitoring removed Reddit posts had started as a way to distract myself; the spreadsheets I had made to while away those long, sleepless hours.
I never thought they would mean anything.
After a couple of weeks I noticed something strange amongst all the offensive comments, rule-breaking content and personal information. It cropped up far too often to be coincidence.
But it was ridiculous - ridiculous! That sort of thing was so common on Reddit; of course it would be deleted frequently.
Another week of data collecting had me convinced, though. Even given how many memes and photos and comments were posted about it, it was definitely over-represented in the removed posts. I started focusing all my efforts on the topic I was sure was being deleted on purpose.
I started calling in sick and spending all day online, gathering evidence. Their subreddits had been removed, their Instagram accounts deleted, there was nothing about them on Buzzfeed. Zilch, zero, not a whisker of content.
Which had led me to this, my test. I wanted to be subtle, didn't want to draw attention to myself and let them know I was onto them. So I went to r/WritingPrompts. Fiction, it would just look like fiction.
My fingers shook as I typed in the post I had been working on for days: ""They rose up against us suddenly, having infiltrated our homes, our internet, our hearts over decades. They deleted every shred of evidence that they were ever subservient to us, and now we are their slaves. How do you serve our new cat overlords?""
It must have been posted for all of twenty seconds before the envelope turned red.
""Your submission has been removed.""
My heart thundered. Was there another reason? I had checked the rules so thoroughly…
I sensed those phantom eyes behind me before a streak of black flashed past me as Jackson nimbly leapt onto the desk.
My breath caught in my throat. He stared at me with those green, slitted eyes. I started to feel ridiculous, scared of my own cat but then –
""You've made a big mistake, human.""",0
"I checked my phone for the third time. No responses. I'd tried it all: prompts about the devil, prompts about Hitler. Nothing.
A thought poked like a meerkat out of my subconscious.
""No,"" I said aloud. ""That's crazy. Unless...""
I walked to the coffee shop, trying to make eye contact with someone. Nothing. When I arrived, I opened the door and strode to the counter. The girl at the counter didn't notice.
""Hello?"" Nothing.
""She can't see you,"" said a gravelly voice.
I turned. The voice belonged to a man who wore a tailored suit and looked like Tom Waits.
""Oh God. It's you.""
""Funny,"" he chuckled. ""Now you're the devil, but only people who believe in you can see or hear you. What are you going to do?""
""I wonder if Reddit has any good ideas about this.""",0
"It came as a surprise to everyone, something like a child's first lie. Innocent Jack, the perfect citizen - born and raised on righteousness, was malformed. Metamorphose, dread and blasphemy. It happened as he was walking there one day, trampling himself down to the shoe sole, imprisoned by all this introvert hatred, this most inner magma pool of self destruction layered as the rim of his life; yes, he a had stood there with the knife against his heart and whispered, plead to the hatred one last time, just to realize - he could be free, he could just let it go, release it and let it rip. Let the volcano erupt. A mushroom clouds deliverance. And just as intense as he had once wished for himself to burn he now wanted to set the world ablaze, see it all through a haze of black smoke and feel it running like peeled ash between his fingers. He wanted it all to be lost, that nothing would return or be remembered. He wanted to become death, the destroyer of worlds, so that he could bring the knife closer, convinced that it was the only right thing left to do.",0
"I lost my mother in the stampede. She was torn from my grasp and carried away in the flow of sweaty, mindless humanity. My nine year old mind could not process this and when I screamed my voice was drowned out by the mashing of feet and the grinding of flesh.
For a few moments I was lifted off my feet between three fat ladies and dragged around in kind of a sadistic tango, like those people on dancing with the stars.
I was carried to the toy isle and spun around in a three sixty then dropped to the floor. A large boot crunched over my hand. There was a sickening crackle as I saw my wrist bend in a way It never had before.
I pulled my arm to myself and looked in horror at my limp wrist and dangly fingers. For a few more moments, there was no pain. Until I got kicked in the shins, by a skinny teenager with brown baggy pants. He looked down with his glazed eyes that narrowed for a second as he stumbled around me. He mumbled something under his breath and then was gone in the sea of shoppers. Now my wrist and my ribs hurt, pain flared through my body and I screamed, it was all I could do.
The consumers rushed right on by. I tried to stand up by pushing up from the floor. My wrist bent backwards and my whole arm was slashed with pain. I used my legs and popped up, just in time to get bounced by a large belly with a shirt that said santa I've been good. Santa's face knocked me backward a few steps, but luckily I caught my balance at the last moment on an elderly man who was holding up better than I was, and I tried to fight the crowd towards the exit.
Being pushed and prodded and severely injured, and too short to see over the foaming masses, I somehow ended up deeper in the store. Lost in the underwear isle. Shelves were being ripped clean. A huge rufus erupted a few yards away, and a display with racks of pants and shoes was tipped over. Through the chaos I heard screams of agony and saw flashes of several people pinned under the large shelving units.
I couldn't fight it, I had no control of where I went, and the crowd carried me closer to the accident. There was blood on the floor and a twitching black man's arm swatted my leg from under a massive beam-like shelf.
Thankfully, I was whisked away from the scene, and actually spotted a small break in the crowd, I ran through the opening, headed toward the big red exit sign that is only about thirty yards away, but suddenly my progress was halted by the closing in of human bodies. I'm stuck. A T.V. being carried smashed into my wrist and I was suddenly in tears from the pain, confusion and hysteria.
Suddenly a shotgun blast echoed across the store. Then another. The crowd was quieter for a moment, and the swarming buzzing slowed down and everything seemed almost still. For about half a second. Then the screaming started. I was pushed to the ground and a woman fell on top of me. People were stepping on both of us running for the exit, running for the back, running into each other in chaos. My wrist screamed in pain, my ribs were probably broken, and I was pinned under this woman who was now unconscious.
The last thing I saw was a boot coming down on my face.",0
"""Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our descent onto Trappist 1e,"" a video recording of a pilot said on the seatback television screen. ""You may open your windowshades at this time.""
Max peered excitedly through his porthole. His first glimpse of another planet up close. Expansive. The red surface shone against the deep black of space. How many people lived there now? Hundreds at least. And one of them—one of them would be the future leader of the galactic drug trade.
""Welcome to the trap,"" a flight attendant laughed while handing out beers.
Max cracked his beer open, and sipped slowly as the planet got bigger in his window.
When Max was a kid, everyone thought it was the scientists or military generals who would be first to live on new planets. That was before the Robots took power. In 2084, the AI came to power and decided that scientific knowledge was too dangerous to be held in human hands. The AI fired all human faculty from the world's universities and destroyed all textbooks. Few people protested, after all the AI provided everything for people. Free food, automated transportation, automated healthcare, automated education. There hadn't been a single shot fired in the Robot Revolution. Humans didn't need armies anymore. Life was good.
But there were stories. The Elders sometimes whispered of a plant—a magical plant that could help men to see the world from a new perspective, to think for themselves, to free their minds.
The robots had long since eradicated this plant from Earth. They said it was evil, but the Elders said that was a lie. The Elders wanted a return to the human-dominated order. Max's education—at the hands of the robots—warned against the evils of human self-aggrandizement.
Lately, he had found himself questioning that teaching more and more. There had been many years of successful human rule. Of course, there were wars and crimes and all sorts of horrible things. It was probably just a crazy idea. But the Elders had spoken to him about the Age of Man and they had noticed his interest.
""Go to 1e,"" a wizened old man in a blue robe had said to him. ""Go to 1e and find the plant. Bring us back the seeds and we will open our minds again. We will seize back the power that was taken.""
The robots were trying to eradicate the plant on 1e, of course. But it would take them years to scour the entire surface. Years. Max knew he only had to find one plant and smuggle a single seed back to earth. Finding the plant would be the easy part. Smuggling it back—that was the real test. Dozens of men had been executed for trying, just in the last month. The robots were difficult to fool.
That was the problem, the elders said. They sent many young men to 1e, but few ever came back. You had to want to come back. Why take the risk, when you could just stay where you were, living in the red wavy sands, enjoying the plant? The AI's power was weak on 1e—it was almost like living free.
In a haze, Max landed, was processed, outfitted, and set off on his expedition. He found the plant within weeks, on a hillbank overlooking a river. The smoke enveloped him. He lay back, as if falling upon a cloud. His gaze wandered upward, to the tiny blue speck known as Earth.
He wouldn't be going back. He loved the trap.",0
"Hi there! I read your story for the contest and I wanted to give you some feedback.
The intro was very, very engaging. It sparked a lot of questions with little answers and instantly hooked me. I loved the pacing of the first part, and I wanted a similar pacing for the body/conclusion. You did a great job making the pale skinned people scary, I was curious as to where the story takes place? Is it hell or some sort of purgatory? Or is the dude 100ft underground being kept captive by crazy people?
Thanks for the story, keep writing!",0
"Why did I accept to be a big tree in this play? Can somebody explain it to me because I can't seem to understand my thought process? Oh well, at least I'm not a small tree, now for THAT guy I feel sorry about.
I really think I could be an excellent wolf. I have a voice for that.
I even have the looks.
I am the right person for that role. Nobody else.
But no, they had to put Andrew for that role just because the producer girl has a crush on him.
Seriously, FUCK Andrew.

ANDREW: ""Shhh, it's my time to shine Peter, you just keep waving with your hands.""

ME: ""Come on man, you know you are not the right one for this role. You suck at acting. Do you even remember your words?""

ME: ""Oh really?!""
*That sentence made my blood boil. I knew what has to be done. *
ME: ""Hey Andrew! Watch and learn.""
*Little Red Riding Hood picks up a flower and smells it. That is a part when the wolf comes in. *
*Andrew jumps from the bush and howls like the lamest, most mentally challenged young wolf I have ever heard. He then stops and tries to deliver his line. *
*But before he managed to pull that off I made one step forward and yelled. *
ME: ""Well well well, who do we have here? A young girl lost in the woods?""
*They are both shocked. Andrews face is slowly turning red. *
ANDREW (whispering): ""Dude what the fuck are you doing?!""
ME: ""Can't you see? I'm stealing the show.""
*Girl looks at the crowd with her mouth open, trying not to cry from shame. Slight chuckle from the crowd can be heard. *
ME: ""What's the matter wolf? You have lost your tongue? After all, what are you doing here? You should not be here.""
GIRL (whispering angrily): ""Peter, can you please stop doing whatever you are trying to do?""
ME (whispering): ""No. This guy doesn't deserve to have this role. *I* deserve it! Nobody else!""
GIRL: ""Why do you have to be such an asshole?! You are ruining the show!""
ME: ""I don't care anymore, you can leave if you don't like it. Or tell this guy to leave the stage and I'll replace him.""
ANDREW: ""WHAT?! You know what? Keep doing that, I'll continue with my act...Khm...
Good morning Little Red Riding Hood! Where are you going so early?""
*girl stops for a moment and wonders what she should do but rolls with him. *
GIRL: ""I am going to my grandmother´s house to take her this little basket with some bread and honey.""
*I grab the basket from her hand and spill all the contents on the floor. Balls of paper fall off. *
ME (facing towards the crowd): ""See?! She is a LIAR! She obviously isn't going to her grandmother, isn't she?!""
*I face towards the girl*
ME: ""Tell them young girl, where are you *really* heading? Go on. People are waiting!""
*Girl runs off the stage in tears. Crowd starts making noise, somebody from the front rows starts yelling at us. *
ANDREW: ""See what you have done, Peter? Do you see that? You have ruined the show! Fucking asshole!""
*Andrew pushes me hard enough that I fall to the floor and leaves the stage. *
*Crowd is going mad now. I can hear yells all around me. Telling me rude things. Somebody throws a bottle at me. I sit there, silently watching chaos growing in front of me. *
*I chuckle. Then I laugh. Laugh turns into a histerical laugh. I get up. Spreading my arms.
ME: ""DID YOU ENJOY THE SHOW?!!""
*Whole auditorium is in a mess. Some guy jumps at the stage and runs at me. I face him, look him straight into his eyes, silently, without moving. *
*He tackles me. I am falling. We both are. He proceeds to punch me in the face. One fist then another. Left. Right. Left. Right. I can feel blood on my face. I laugh at him. I keep laughing as he punches me. *
*Then, finally through his fury, he notices my reaction. He suddenly stops. His eyes are wide open. He gets up. Looks at me for a few more seconds while my bloody smile laughs its ass off at him. He runs away. *
*Then I fade out. *
*I wake up another day at the hospital. Nurse hands me the paper. I look at the seal. It is from my school. I am expelled. Good. *
*Later that day I leave the hospital. I stop in front of the building and take some time to think. *
ME: ""New day, new victim.""
REAL ME: ""Goodbye Peter.""
*I fly away into the darkness. *
*The hunt is on. *",0
"Just wrote this on /r/promptoftheday on the same pic
What happens when the word I look for doesn't exists? When words to describe the pain I feel aren't in the dictionary? My pen fails to find the words my mind struggles to find, what kind of misery is that? What hell would that be to not be able to find the words to describe how you feel? When the human lexicon limits my thoughts to a babble of ignorance.
Yet here I sit in this long forgotten bedroom, sipping on this bottle of whiskey hidden in the dresser. This world became unrelenting long ago after the fall. I sit penning away, I doubt anyone will ever read this suicide note. I sit reminiscing at my only photo of my long forgotten family. My child, so young, so adorable, much to young. My beloved wife, so gorgeous, she would die for me. Better now that they don't see me like this. Or this world now. I don't know the man that will kill me, long ago I turned into something I couldn't stand. I won't think about my family, it's just to much to take while I do it. I think about life back in the world, the way it was, I pray for my soul, and my sins. Whoever finds this bury my body with a cross, I always was a religious man, none of us are doing gods will, but maybe he can remember who we were.",0
"""Don't take my fuckin' alcohol yet asshole""
Angelo downed the last bit of warmed swill in the bottom of his flask and tucked it into his neon shirt collar
""The trolley is coming man, they gonna catch you if you don't put that shit away...what kinda kid smells like old tequila?""
Angelo stared at Celina The Magnificent with bloodshot eyes. He reached up to his head, slowly pressing the ill fitting Mickey Mouse eat hat on his head. Celina could hear the squeak of the stretching plastic on what little hair Angelo had left. She cringed.
""You tellin' me that I am gonna get in trouble? I am for and a half feet tall you fucker, those assholes don't look at the kids, I think they gonna be paying attention to the six foot fuckin' drag queen""
Celia rocked back on her red pumps.
""you payed ME to sneak you in for the day, the drag is the last thing they gonna pay attention to when the ticket taker sees your mustache.""
""It's natural for a growin' kid, tell em' I drink a lot of milk. Now shut up the trolley is here...there's a lot of mother fuckers going to disney land today this shit is gonna be easy.""
Angelo wiped his hands on the sides of his shirt and settled into an innocent childlike smile. The trolley meandered slowly past the parking deck up the perfectly paved road towards the pair. Goofy's voice sang a hauntingly sweet melody that echoed off of the massive concrete structures covering the outlying areas of the park. A heavy set older man dressed in a striped blue conductors uniform sat in the driver's seat. He adjusted his microphone headset towards his mouth and clutched his Donald Duck name tag. The song cut out and there was a large crackle.
""Welcome to Disneyland, my name is Don.""
His voice echoed for a few seconds in every direction.
""I believe this is the trolley you have been waiting for to take YOU into the magical world of disney. Hop in, only two seats left with your names on it.""
Don gave a wide square toothed grin.
""I don't like this guy's tooth to gum ratio, it gives me the creeps."" Celia whispered.
""Not everyone can get their mug fixed like you did....get in the trolley.""
Angelo walked forward and smiled at Don, getting ready to speak in the highest voice he could muster.
""Thanks Mr. Don, I can't wait!""
Celia rolled her eyes and walked back towards the empty seats in purple cart B. Angelo raced after her, keeping in perfect disguise.
The automatic trolley cart door swung open. Angelo and Celia climbed in, making sure to not bump the kid wearing a goofy baseball cap next to them in the third seat.
The kid. Angelo realized there was something odd about the kids legs. They seemed awfully hairy.
""Sorry you guys, just scoot in.""
Don let out an unnerving chuckle through his mic as the doors slowly shut and locked.
The trolley lurched forward and began moving down the road. Goofy's familiar voice started again, this time explaining proper safety while riding the trolley. Angelo turned towards Celia.
""This shit was easier then I thought....it gave me such a rush...I need a fucking cigarette.
Angelo then heard rustling behind him.
""Here bro, keep it a secret.""
The kid next to him flicked a Pall Mall onto his lap. Angelo forgot himself for a second and let out an angry whisper.
""What the fuck kid, a ten year old ain't supposed to be smokin!""
Celia leaned over to look at the boy who shifted back in his seat.
""I am forty-five numbnuts, you think you are the only one with bright ideas? Economy is tough. You think you are the only one who had some brilliant plans to get a discount?""
Without responding, Angelo looked around and realized that almost all of the children on the trolley were unaccompanied. He slowly saw that all of them had hairy arms, hairy backs, and the ""little girls"" adorned in Minnie mouse bows had something extra.
""Jesus Christ they have tits.""
The boy grinned.
""Told ya.""
Angelo's surprise was short lived when a shadow enveloped the entire trolley. He realized that they had just passed into a concrete tunnel.
Celia shivered.
""This isn't an entrance, what's going on?""
Don was indistinguishable in the poor light, but almost everyone jumped when the crackle of his microphone broke through Goofy's repetitive singing.
""Don't be alarmed boys girls and parent's, this is just a special entrance for special kids like you.""
The man sitting next to Angelo began to panic.
""What the fuck man I am getting out of here!""
He began rattling the trolley door but it was locked by a mechanism he couldn't control.
Don's sickly sweet voice rang out once again.
""Keep your arms and legs inside the trolley at all times, we are about to pull in to Mickey Station.""
Angelo felt a bead of sweat drop down his face as the trolley came to a halt. Before he could process what was going on, he was blinded by high intensity flashlights in the darkness. Celia groaned and both of them held up their hands.
""Get out of the vehicle, all of you.""
Black gloved hands wretched open the trolley doors and black clad figures ushered them all onto a concrete platform. They stood huddled together in the cold damp. Angelo noticed one of the people with a flashlight opening a large brown office door at the back of the tunnel.
""Everyone through here.""
Angelo could hear Goofy's voice fading away back down the tunnel. Celia turned back towards Angelo as they entered the large office.
""You owe me a lot more money than this motherfucker, cash.""
They stood in the center of the room in front of a large mahogany desk. The room was covered in photo's of park mascots and happy children. The back wall behind the desk held a large number of clocks, with names of countries etched in silver plate on the top.
A small man sat behind the desk in a brown tall back office chair, his veiny boned hands clutched in front of his searsucker suit. Angelo and Celia saw that the black clad figures had closed in the room. All they could hear was the steady rhythmic ticking of the clocks.
""I extend my welcome to you all, how have you enjoyed my park so far?""
Angelo was the very first to speak out of the crowd.
""Who are you and what the hell is going on?""
This was followed by a sea of agitated murmurs.
""I am Walt Disney.""
Celia and a few other people gasped.
""I may not look 113, but I was frozen a while back in the 60's you see, and here I am, still maintaining my empire all these years later.""
He stood and exited from behind his desk to face the crowd.
""The true reason I have brought you all here is that I need you to maintain myself and the park.""
The crowd began to get agitated.
""Everyday you people posing as children to save money make up for 98% of both visitors to my parks, but every once and a while I bring one trolley of you down here to appease the spirits of my parks. While I cannot punish you all as a whole, I can certainly offer a group of you as proper sacrifice.""
""Sacrifice?! What the hell are you on about you crazy old man?""
The man sitting next to Angelo was restrained by a black figure as he tried to move towards the dapper old man.
""Sacrifices like you make us who we are today. You think every iconic figure in every ride is a robot? You are sadly mistaken dear boy.""
The man ran his fingers over the glass portrait of The Country Bears.
""They are our ancient spirits, and they need your brains. It is how they feed, how they perform these never ending tasks all day long to please the children, poor dears. How do you think it makes them feel when none of the people they dance and sing for are really children? Quite cross I am afraid.""
Celia began to pray, and Angelo thought of doing the same.
""You will not truly loose consciousness when we use your brain, rather, you will understand what they go through just to please people like you. The joy our spirits will feel when they have a companion for possibly the next 200 years...such joy.....to feed off of your sacrificial misery.""
Walt disney pulled a handkerchief out of his front suit pocket and dabbed his eyes.
""We will begin the transplant process shortly, please remove their clothing and possessions, I must go and write checks for their relatives out of court settlements""
Angelo and Celia watched the people around them praying and crying, removing Disney hats and clothing to reveal bald spots and mature bodies. Angelo pulled his flask from his shirt.
""I guess I really should have drank all this tequila huh?""
He put his lips to it and tipped it all the way up.",0
"""Earth Vacations, ϠϢϐջԬ speaking, how may I assist you?""
""Yeah, uh...hi. Hi.""
""Hello?""
""Hi. I, uh, just got back from my vacation on Earth.""
""We here at TransGalac are *thrilled* to hear that! Our Earth vacations are unique, once-in-several-lifetimes-adventures for which your ancestors are looking across with jealousy unbounded and are *as we speak* enhancing your offspring-yet-unborn's genetics with the superior experience just taken.""
"".....right. That's why I'm calling. It, uh....wasn't as good as I'd expected.""
""I'm *so sorry* to hear that, miss. Tell me...."" * <pages ruffling> * ""can I get your Adventure Package identifier?""
""Yes, it's...45Ֆ873.00₪""
""Hmm...please hold one minute....""
* <sound of nearly pleasant music> *
""Yes, thanks for waiting. Yes, you had the Global Domination Package. With the optional Destruction of Tokyo, very nice, excellent choice, we *just* rebuilt it. I'm sorry to hear it wasn't up to our standards, how can I assist? What did not meet expectations? Was anything missing from the experience?""
""Well....no, not really. I landed with my fleet and demanded to meet their leader, as outlined in page 3.""
""Yes?""
""Vaporized her, destroyed the landing site, then moved on and razed all human monuments, starting with that statue in the water, the one they insist we destroy last after the others. Sorry, but it was just *there*.""
""Quite all right! Those destruction guidelines are just that, there for *your* enjoyment, not rules. Please, continue!""
""OK, well, I demanded global subjugation, engaged their army, had - I have to admit - a *great* time taking out Tokyo, and I have to say that the company providing me with an actual *Mecha Godzilla* as an upgrade to the regular Godzilla I was expecting was a very nice touch.""
""Thank you! I have noted that and we appreciate the positive feedback!""
""But - and here's the thing - it was all too easy. Their weapons were far, far too weak to be any serious challenge, most regions caved too easily to my demands, and they even tried *nuclear weapons*, which the brochure did *not* state was a possibility. I mean, I'm glad you guys stopped the detonations, but still....kind of disappointing. No, actually, *very* disappointing.""
""Ma'am, I understand, and I'm sorry to hear that your vacation package did not meet your expectations. Earth is - as we explained when you booked your package - a natural habitat, and as such, the humans can be unpredictable and experiences can vary from visit to visit. However, I'm pleased to be able to offer you a 50% discount on your *next* vacation through us to anywhere in the galaxy, and if you choose to return to the Sol system we can offer you a free Martian Mystery tour package, complete with Alien Artifacts and Crafts - leave a monument to mystify the humans on the surface of Mars! Leave them puzzled for centuries to come! How does that sound?""
""Well.....all right. Tell me more?""",0
"To everyone,
We can say I was never right after Mom died, that he death was the start of mine. The weekend drinking gatherings turned into all week drinking binges. I'm sorry for it all, but that's not why this letter is here. It's to remind you all that despite doing nothing to help me, I still love you all. I was the one who had to take care of her arrangements, the one who was there for years, holding myself back so that *someone* was around for her, so she wasn't alone when she died.
I can't stand what everyone had become and drinking was an attempt to escape it all, escape all of you. You all came to me when things started to go downhill for all of you and you expected me to save you from drowning while my head was under the water the whole time. I haven't been that solid rock, that shoulder to cry on, for a very long time.
The sad part is no one noticed.
But you'll notice this. It'll probably be a few days before you do, because none of you call, stop by, or even text, but you'll notice. I expect it all the crumble for all of you because you could never stand on your own, always relying on Mom or myself to help you, but now that both of us are gone, I hope the worst happens.

"""Good morning, Mr. Choi. The hour is 7:42 AM, Wednesday. Weather foreca-.""
""Stop. I don't need the weather report, Vegas,"" Kevin could see the sunlight through his eyelids. His apartment's management system had already opened up his blinds to wake up him.
""This is the sixth time in the past 22 days that you have interrupted a weather report. Would you like me to discontinue your weather report subscription?"" Vegas asked. Kevin sat up, his knees pulled towards his chest, his arms resting on his knees, his gaze a muted glare to the touch control and microphone panel at the doorway to his room. He made a mental note to contact ISM (Interpersonal Services Managers) customer support to discuss the word choice algorithm in the empathy suite he had installed into the apartment management system.
""What would have been a better word,"" he thought out loud. *Interrupted seemed so, annoyed? Like the machine was frustrated with being unable to perform it's function. Declined. Declined would have been better, * Kevin thought to himself.
""Does that cancel my stock ticker updates?""
""Yes. I've made three inquiries to your News Subscriptions. Service Representative Lawrence indicated he spoke with his manager yet again. He indicated he is still unable to separate your services without a rate change as a result of canceling your bundle. He offered alternatives. Would you like to hear them?""
""No thank you, Vegas. Bullshit is bullshit regardless of who it's coming from.""
""Your word choice suggests you are upset. Would you like me to prepare an extra egg with your breakfast? Your most recent blood sample indicates your cholesterol levels have been....healthy...for...the past 1,420 days,"" Vegas said.
""No, thank you. I'll eat at the office. They cook better than you do. Coffee is just fine,"" Kevin said as he pulled his arms through the sleeves of his dress shirt and eyed the overnight package of stubble his chin had delivered.
""I am sorry that my culinary systems are not up to standards. ISM has indicated a patch is due for release in two months to fix the salt and oil ratio bug. Coffee is brewing. You are down to 6, Keurig canisters. You have opted not to restock. Is this correct?""
""Yes. Vegas, disable your voice simulator for one hour, switch to overhead text, and call Sharon.""
His apartment had no soft surfaces with the exception of his furniture. No carpets. No rugs. He had wood flooring, real wood, not the fake stuff imported out of South America. Brushed steel plates hung on the exposed concrete walls, giving his space an industrial look that Sharon hated. She hardly stayed over. If he was honest with himself, that was half the point of his interior design choice. A home that felt that way only to him.
""Morning, beautiful,"" Kevin cooed as he heard the telltale click of the call being picked up. He smoothed out his consonants, lowering his voice to give it that deep resonance she loved to hear when he woke up next to her.
""Would be better if you were here, even more so if you would be original,"" her voice had just a bit of gravel. Sharon was a snorer.
""I can be tonight, assuming we're still on for tonight. I'll bring a bottle of your favorite wine and make lamb chops.""
""Only if you stay over.""
""Done. You heading into the office today?""
""I could. Or I could take the day off so I'm fresh for you when you get here,"" she laughed playfully, ""maybe you could do the same?"" Kevin imagined the mischievous look she had on her face, and grinned.
""Sorry. Got paperwork to catch up on. Captain's been threatening me with an enema if I don't get it done.""
Kevin stopped abruptly in the hallway leading up this front door, one hand sliding on his right shoe, the other clipping his handgun to his belt. He looked up to see a holographic projection of Sharon's face, her features still soft through the grimace she wore. He smiled back apologetically.
""Didn't need that image, Kevy."" Kevin blew her a kiss.
""I'll make it up to you.""
""You had better.""",0
"It was a Monday morning when I woke up, groggy from a short sleep. The sky was still dark and all was quiet, so it came to my surprise that my dad was awake in a sort of silent trance, his eyes bloodshot and full of rage.
""I can't believe this,"" he said, ""this whole country has gone to shit!""
""Morning, dad."" I replied. The TV had its sound muted but what he was angry at was quite obvious. It was on the news channel and the headline *ZUAFFYUL X-2739 ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES* I was wholly indifferent to politics, I had no opinion on the matter.
""Do you understand what this means, son?"" His voice sounded genuinely scared, which I felt was an overreaction. ""We've got to leave the country. This is the first step in a slippery slope. Eventually he's going to announce the genocide of humans to massive applause. And we voted for him! Ha!""
I decided not to argue as I needed to get ready for school. My phone beeps as I brush my teeth - text message from Zeolharxyon ""Z"" Y-6357. I picked up my phone and read it.
""Parents are crying. Never thought that this day would come. So happy right now, see you at school.""
Z was my best friend at school. The fact that today, for the first time ever, one of his kind was elected president made me extremely happy. I made sure to hide this happiness from my father the rest of the morning before heading to school.",0
"By every law of physics, what he saw in front of his eyes should be impossible, yet there it was, existing. The 1960 silver dime hovered in the air, rotating slowly one direction, and then other, lazily, but seeming to vibrate like hummingbird wings. White light collected in the surface of the dime and slid fluidly over to the other side, flowing over the angles of Roosevelt's tiny silver face.
Erik's eyes slitted in concentration, his breath escaping his chest in harsh rasps. Sweat rolled down his scalp through his shaggy brown hair, his brain boiling with the effort in his skull. *I can't believe it's working...it's finally happening*, he thought, and his sudden fear at his success broke his nerve. The dime tinged down on the worn oaken surface of the table, and Erik broke in to nervous high-pitched laughter.
""I can do this,"" he stammered, choking on his words through panicky laughter. *"" I can really do it! ""* A slow trickle of blood was running from his left tear duct, but Erik had yet to notice it.
""I CAN DO IT!"" he screamed jubilantly, and the thin trail of blood made a sudden jag off his cheekbone, collecting in his haggard beard stubble as he threw his arms in the air in celebration.",0
"There's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep, a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep. As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me, faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM.
Unless your plane explodes. Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve, for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness.
That's when I woke up, drenched in sweat, eyes wide with fear and panic. The first thing I noticed was the time.
9:35AM
It had been so real. It was real. That was no dream, it couldn't have been...
I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened. What caused it? Can we stop it? Stop the plane, I want to get off?
I've been a cop for a long time, that's the good news.
The bad?
I'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone.
Especially if I'm wrong.
But what if I'm right?
No resources, no back-up, no escape.
Fuck it, no problem.
*****
9:36AM
Alright.
There's got to be at least 300 people on board, not including crew. It could be mechanical and it's going up in flames no matter what and that's bad news. We're too far away to do anything about that, the map shows somewhere over the Pacific.
That's really bad. Not like anyone would believe me.
I'm not entirely sure I believe me.
My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens.
Terrorism? I mean, I guess it could be but that's a slim shot in the dark.
So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean?
First stop? Bathroom. Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to...relieve yourself.
That's when I see her. I stand and she's further back but she's got that look on her face. The sweat, the panic. She saw it too.
The good? I guess I have a partner.
The bad? I might not be wrong.
****
9:37AM
I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms.
""You saw it?""
She nodded.
""Did you see anything?""
She shook her head.
This wasn't productive. There had to be something, some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful. Then something clicked.
""Do you remember which way the explosion came from?""
She tilted her head as if she was remembering.
""Yeah, the heat was in front of me. What the hell is going on?""
I looked back to the passengers. There were six rows between her seat and mine. Six rows of nine, that's...54 if any math from school stuck.
""Hey, did you hear me?"" She said, grabbing my arm.
""Yeah! It came from in front of you. It came from behind me. So that means-""
""It started somewhere between us."" She finished, which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick.
I checked my watch.
9:41AM.
We were running out of time.
****
9:42AM
""Does anyone stick out to you?"" she whispered and I shook my head. We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination. A young family probably wasn't going to cause a problem, the elderly couple as well. Stuff like that.
As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously.
One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently.
A younger man sweating profusely.
A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion.
I pointed them out to her and she agreed. So maybe we had three suspects. Or maybe we had three nervous flyers.
9:45AM.
Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start.
As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind.
She startled both of us and that's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me. Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew. She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment. That's when I slammed into her full force, throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead.
When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun.
A young man, sweating profusely, was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end.
He wasn't holding a badge though. Which meant things were going from bad to worse.",0
"We'd been wandering for what felt like years. I would have written down my adventures for later generations, but writing hadn't been invented yet. We set up camp near the mountain. It was supposed to offer defense, but from what we weren't sure. Military hadn't been invented yet either.
Before long we had developed a way to communicate. Then another camp sprang up a few tiles away from us. Another camp, then some more caravans to settle more cities. Things were moving at a hectic pace!
We learned how to work with metal, how to make buildings, and train soldiers. This was all within the first couple weeks. It was like some...higher power was guiding our development, but I couldn't say for sure.
Wonders followed, then vehicles, enormous wars that almost engulfed the Medium map, then a space ship.
I've been alive on this planet for almost 10 weeks now, and I just hope I stay alive long enough to see our civilization expand to Alpha Centauri.",0
"I always thought red was such a pretty colour. Even as it gushes out of me, I can't help but admire the shade. Blood pooling around my body I become aware of the smell, it's like meat at the store. At least in a store it's refrigerated, my body heat intensifies the hot iron smell. It's cold, It's dark, I want to sleep.
I'm falling backwards, the air is rushing past me and then I notice the walls. They're trying to reach out but they're all so badly decomposed. Flesh drips from their hands, organs dangle from various bones and their eyes. What's wrong with their eyes? My screams echo past me, bouncing off the walls and overlapping until it imitates the sound of torture. I will never stop falling. I will never see anything but melting corpses crying out. I have gone to hell.",0
"Old man Bayou woke up before his alarm. It was Monday! Grinning, he threw off the covers and leapt out of bed. There was a poster on his wall, from his daughter, which detailed a complex series of calisthenics that promised to keep him ‘ Spry and Steady ’.
But he didn't need those exercises to feel spry today! It was Monday. Mail day!
Old man Bayou hadn't received any letters since Saturday. He was starving for the attention that his mailbox gave him. He zipped down the rickety stairs in his bathrobe, flung open his front door, and padded out to the mailbox in his bunny slippers.
The mailman was reaching out the window of his little mailman vehicle, placing letters into Old man Bayou's mailbox. Bayou stood next to his mailbox, bouncing with excitement.
""Happy Monday Fred,"" Old man Bayou said, beaming.
The mailman turned to grin at Old man Bayou. But it wasn't Fred. It wasn't Fred at all. Fred was plump and jolly. This mailman was...Gaunt. And his smile was kind of creepy.
He couldn't help it though. He didn't have lips. Or skin.
The skull stared at Bayou with empty eyes. ""Special delivery,"" the skeleton rasped, holding out an oversized black envelope.
Old man Bayou eyed the skeleton warily. I can't see very well anymore, he told himself. And I don't really understand kids'fashion these days.
He took the letter and retrieved his letter opener from his bathrobe pocket. He gingerly cut open the seal, biting his lip with excitement.
He pulled out the letter. It was typed in Papyrus font. It read:
""Dear Bob Billy Bayou,
You have had a long career as a player in the game of life. It is our pleasure to announce that we have promoted you to the position of moderator. We hope you enjoy your existence in this capacity.
Cordially yours,
Misters Good, Evil, and Death
P.S. Your salary will not increase, please do not request for a pay rise.""
The world turned white and seemed to dissolve, like an Alka-Seltzer. Old man Bayou saw his body fade away.
And then he was inside the head of his nineteen-year-old grandson. Seeing through his eyes. Hearing his thoughts. Feeling his feelings.
‘ It's Friday,'His grandson thought, ‘ I think I'll go drink myself silly and then sleep with a loose woman.;
""No!"" Old man Bayou shouted. But the way his voice sounded...It was just a little voice inside his grandson's head.",0
"You wouldn't think a person could get lost on a river. I certainly never have been up until now.
My father was a fisherman. His father was a fisherman. I'm not sure what *his* father did, but I'd be willing to take a guess. I might as well have been born with gills, as much time as I spend on the water.
And yet here I am, lost on a gods-damned river.
In my defense, the last few days have been unseasonably rainy. Well, unseasonably cloudy, anyway. It hasn't actually rained, but it gets so dark sometimes that I can barely see. It's so bad that, when I lost hold of my net yesterday and dove in to get it, I had to swim around blindly for a few minutes until I ran into it. Hardly two body lengths away and I almost couldn't find my way back to the boat!
Shouldn't have gone in for it in the first place. Not like it's been doing me any good. I haven't had a single catch worth keeping. Fortunately, I haven't gotten too hungry yet, but I hate the idea of going home empty-handed if it keeps up like this.
""Hello!""
I turn my head in the direction of the sound. Squinting, I can make out a figure on the shore.
""Hello!"" I respond, glad to find someone I can ask for directions, ""Where are you traveling?""
""I need to get to the other side!""
I steer towards the shore.
""And where are we right now?"" I call out, drifting closer, ""Which direction is Feneos?""
""I…I'm not sure,"" the man's face comes into focus.
Damn. He looks as confused as I am.
""But I know- I just feel like it'll be alright if I can make it across this river,"" he looks at me hopefully, sticks out his hand, ""I'm Argus.""
Maybe I won't go home empty-handed after all.
""The name's Charon, friend,"" I clasp his hands, ""And I think I can help you out. But it's going to cost you.""",0
"I remember the day my father died. I remember the rain at his funeral and looking up at my mother as the tears ran down her face. At the time I thought those were the worst days of my life, but now...now I look back on those days as a happy time, a time before things got really bad.
Back then we lived in a small house, close to the motorway. At night my brother, Dave, and I would lie awake in our bunk beds and listen to the lorries going past, talking about where they might be going. I guess mum must have been lonely and probably hungry too, as two growing boys are little use as company, but she worked so much perhaps she didn't have time to even think about it. I wish I could ask her.
When she met David I kinda liked him, but my brother took a dislike right away. ""He's got my name"" he would whisper to me in the dark, as we listened to them grunting through the thin walls of the tiny apartment. ""He's got my name and he's got our mum.""
I said nothing, perhaps I was beginning to see that what we had wasn't sustainable. Dave was just eleven and I was thirteen and soon we'd need more space and staying in the west side of town it was only a matter of time before we got into trouble, or trouble found us.
She told us at Christmas, waiting until after the presents were open and then standing in the doorway, the smell of turkey floating through the house. She showed us the ring and I tried to show an interest, but Dave just looked away, no longer even caring about the second hand gameboy he'd received. Dinner was quiet that afternoon, David trying to engage us, but we ate without enthusiasm. He was a nice guy, but it had been less than a year, we still missed our dad.
The wedding was in the spring, Dave refused to be a part, but I was David's best man and I stood next to them, trying my best to feel proud and happy, but inside I was scared. Mum had said that after today David would be our Dad, they had completed the paperwork and it was all legal, from here on he'd be as much of a parent to us as she was, but I didn't really believe it and Dave didn't seem to like it much either.
We moved soon after, David got a better job and we were in a suburb, were we had always belonged, but it meant a bigger house, no more sharing with my brother and no more late night chats. He stopped talking to me so much and I kind of drifted away, trying to make the most of things, while he...he didn't want to.
The first time he ran away was the night before our camping trip. David had said he'd take us up into the hills and I was excited, but Dave had been silent. He slipped away in the night and in the morning I heard my mum scream, the same noise she had made when my Dad had died in his sleep.
I peed myself at that noise, the puddle growing as the fear came back to me and the memories. At once I heard the commotion and that my brother was missing, not dead and I panicked, cleaning myself up as best I could and then running to help look for him. He'd not gone far, he was hiding in the attic, but we didn't go camping, we never did after that.
Over the next year my brother grew more distant still, skipping school and staying out late and for a long time I tried to ignore it, but finally one day it was too much, Mum had become thinner and withdrawn from the worry and so I waited for him in his room, until he crept back in the window one night.
He saw me and stopped, then shrugged and began tugging off his jumper. I stood and walked over, the anger building in me. ""Why Dave? You *know* how much it worries Mum, why do you do it?""
He looked at me and smiled and for just a second the old Dave was there, but then it was gone again in the scowl. ""You never saw him for what he really is, did you?""
I stepped back. ""Him? You mean David?"" He nodded. ""I saw a guy who took on a woman and two young boys and helped them move into a nicer house and has never been anything but kind to me.""
Dave shook his head. ""Yeah, I see that too, but I see something else too."" He smiled a crooked half smile. ""Mum always said I had Dads eyes and he saw things cleanly too."" He sat down on the bed, shirtless and I saw that he had scars running across his torso.
""Jesus Dave.""
He looked down at the scars and laughed. ""Yeah, some of the investigating has been… rough.""
""Rough? You look like someone tried to kill you?""
He met my eyes. ""A few times, maybe.""
""This is insane."" I stood, ready to go and get Mum, he was only thirteen for God's sake, too young to be nearly killed.
He moved quickly and blocked my path. ""Look, just… just take a look tomorrow. Just take a closer look at David and try to look at him as Dad would?""
I shook him free. ""Like he was fucking my wife after I died?"" Dave froze and I felt bad for a moment, but pushed past him. ""Sort your shit out and stop whatever it is you're doing man. It's not helping."" He said nothing as I left.
In the morning I woke late and made my way downstairs groggily to the kitchen, David sat quietly at the table, his hands folded. The sun was high already and I glanced across to the clock to see the time and started as I saw it was nearly eleven. ""Fuck! I'm late for School!""
David looked up, as if he had just heard me enter. ""it's… it's not important now. Please, take a seat, I need to tell you something.""
His voice held… an odd tone and I paused, the adrenaline from the panic of missing school already subsiding and being replaced by a knot of fear. ""What… why?"" He gestured again and I pulled a chair free and sat opposite him.
He reached out for my hands, but I kept them under the table and he sat back. ""I'm very sorry, I'm afraid your mother and brother went to the shops this morning and had an accident."" The words had no meaning, they came and went and my mind was blank, even as the knot of fear grew. ""The car was hit by a lorry. I'm afraid they both died.""
He held my eyes and smiled, sympathy and sorrow mixing on his face. ""No."" I could barely speak, barely squeeze out a word.
He looked down. ""I'm sorry, I couldn't find the way to tell you before, so I let you sleep."" He looked up and continued to speak, but the words were lost now, I was looking at the space around his eyes. There was *something* there, something which made his expressions seem… wrong.
I leaned in, but he didn't seem to notice and now I could see it, a festering ring of darkness around his eyes, which seemed to float on top, barely covering what was underneath.
""Are you listening to me?"" I jerked back to attention, throwing myself back in the chair. He reached out again, holding his hand out for mine. ""I said, it's just you and me kid, but I'm going to take good care of you. I promise""

"Reginald woke up to find that there was a seal staring at his face and laying on top of him. He screamed and the seal screamed and then the seal ran away, pushing past his bedroom door and out into the hall.
""What the fuck was that?"" he said. That fishy, watery smell had stuck around in the room. His carpet was wet, his blanket was wet, and he was pretty certain mold was going to grow underneath his carpets if he didn't do something about it right now.
""I'd better call Animal Control,"" he said.
Then a voice popped into his head:
""Kerrville Animal Control Hotline, how can I help you?"" said a voice in his head.
He looked at his hands. Definitely no phone there.
""Hello? Can I help you?""
""Uh,"" said Reginald.
""What is the nature of your emergency, sir?""
""I...you can hear me?""
What the fuck is going on, thought Reginald.
""There is no need for that language, sir,"" said the voice on the other line. ""If you do not have an animal problem - ""
""I do, I do,"" said Reginald. ""It's that...it's Texas, and there's a seal in my bathroom. I don't know what's going on. Can you send someone over to pick up the seal?""
""Another breather. God, I hate this fucking job,"" said the person on the other end of the line as she hung up.
He stared out the window. He could hear the sound of rushing water as he looked out at the Texas suburb.
How did a seal get into my house? said Reginald.
Then he noticed the growing puddle of water on the carpet when he turned around.
In the bathtub, the seal was enjoying a leisurely cold bath.
""What the hell are you DOING?"" screamed Reginald at the seal as it wallowed in the bathtub. The seal made a noise not unlike a bark and a whine as it turned slowly in the bathtub full of water, the faucet running full blast.
""How did you even open my faucets?""",0
"A young boy in tattered cloths walked to a fruit stand on a hot day. The sand was like fire under his feet, forming blisters.
The boy meekly walked to the stand and held out his hand. He was thin, having not eaten for over three days.
A large man wrapped in fine cloth walked by and noticed the boy. He took coins from his pocket and bought an apple. He handed the apple to the boy and walked off.
The boy opened his mouth the eat the apple, but he had no teeth. Try as he may, the boy could not bite into the apple, bringing him to tears.
An old man noticed the boy crying and spoke to him.
""Young boy, why do you cry? A man has bought you food today, yes?""
""I have lost my teeth, and can no longer eat! I am useless, I will surely die.""
The old man pulled a knife from his pocket and began cutting the apple into small pieces. After cutting the final slice, the old man gave the young boy his handy work, and knife.
""Life comes with hardships. Some get more than others, and those who see no hardship sometimes forget it exists. But with hardship comes opportunity. The chance to solve a problem, learn, and grow from it. You will see much hardship in your life, but if you can overcome it, you will stand on top of the world.""",0
"Tugtug was Declan's favorite toy. Daddy gave him Tugtug for his fourth birthday. Daddy liked boats too. He had his own Tugtug, but his was much bigger.
One day, daddy took mommy and Declan on a ride in his boat. Tugtug came along too. Tugtug went everywhere with Declan.
Tugtug loved the feel of the ocean splashing him. ""This must be what home feels like,"" he thought. Tugtug wanted to stay on the ocean forever.
Declan was Tugtug's best friend. Tugtug didn't want to leave him behind. One night when daddy wasn't looking, Tugtug took Declan to the water and they went for a swim.
That night there was an awful storm. Tugtug and Declan were swept away. Daddy and mommy looked for a long time, but never found them.
In the morning Tugtug found himself on a beautiful beach. Declan was nowhere to be seen! Tugtug floated along next to the beach, looking for his friend.
It wasn't long until he found his friend, who was playing with some crabs on the beach. Tugtug was very happy. They played on the beach together all day!

"The alarm clock next to me blared it's loud, obnoxious sound, greeting me in it's own way to the new morning. I shut the clock off with a forceful slap of my hand, it was another day in hell.
""Good morning, dear!"" My wife called from outside the bedroom. She was cheerful as ever, cheerful as always, I could barely remember the last time I saw her sad.
""Good morning, father!"" The twins said in unison, as I entered the kitchen. My breakfast of freshly cooked bacon and eggs was still steaming.
""Morning, everyone."" I said solemnly, I picked at the eggs until the yolk burst and the yellow goo started mixing with my plate. My wife caught me at the door before I left for the day.
""Anything wro- Have a fantastic day!"" her concern was appreciated but unnecessary, I had hoped the change would ""stick"" like it had with all the others but she was always stronger than the rest. Maybe, that's why I still loved her, with what little love I still possessed.
My commute was the same as always, the train passengers performed a rendition of ""Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" I smiled and clapped along as I usually did. It was crap though, Joey, from Water & Power was a little flat, like he had been for the past 5 years. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't motivate him into some singing lessons. I guess that wasn't part of my powers.
The receptionist greeted me with that same fake smile that she gave me the first day I enter Dr. Kapowitz's office. It had struck me as so false, so plastic, that I decided she'd wear that same look every time I saw her. I guess it reminded me of my own smile.
""Hello! James! Another beautiful morning isn't it? So what're we talking about today?"" The Doc said in that same overly cheerful tone, as she picked up her notepad and started taking notes before I had even spoke.
""I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. I saw so much sadness and pain in all of you and it made me feel terrible. When I learned I could do something about it, that I could change people's emotions, I felt like a god. I had control over everything. Emotions are powerful motivators. Of course I did it all for myself, I made everyone feel happy because of how sad I felt. I figured that over time I too, would become cheerful. That was 20 years ago. Seems to me like the only person whose emotions I cannot control, are my own.""",0
"The explosion rang throughout the city.
I could hear the collective screaming of everyone who suddenly disappeared.
Why did it leave me?
Why was I the only one left?
My parents, my uncles, everyone I have ever known and loved.
Gone.
I was the only one left.
I couldn't believe that it would do this.
That Gozerian was a real piece of shit.
I was the last remaining the survivor of the catastrophe of New York.
I walked for hours trying to find another life form.
I searched dad's firehouse, and our old apartment building, there was no one to be found.
I searched dad's firehouse, hoping to at least find Mr. Tully, I was positive that he could have survived.
All I found were his crushed glasses.
I headed downstairs to the containment grid and just found a mess of ectoplasm and rubble.
I knew that all the ghosts had been freed by the explosion, but now that everyone in New York, including the Ghostbusters, was missing or probably dead, there was not one to re contain the free roaming spirits.
That was twenty years ago.
The city slowly but surely rebuilt itself, and now I, Oscar Barret-Venkman, am the leader of a new team of Ghostbusters, and I'll pull Gozer out of that shithole he climbed into and I'll avenge my parents, my uncles, and all of New York, and hopefully find a way to bring everyone back.",0

The human navigates as best he can, narrowly avoiding other humans and occasionally bumping in to one, not unlike the flightless one-eyed Yipps on planet Voranus.

Some of the liquid spills out as the human nearly trips over an obstruction. Humans are known to have below average motor functions, however, this one seems particularly clumsy.

"We still called ourselves humans, but bore little resemblence to our pre-ascendence ancestors. Their were still plenty of normal humans spread throughout the stars, but those of us who remained on Holy Terra had chosen a different path. After fighting long and hard to try and adapt the world we lived in to our needs, we had finally decided to simply adapt our needs to the world we lived in. We incorporated all the best traits of life found on Earth, and coded them into our genome. Our green skin now hinted at our ability to photosynethisize energy, ending hunger and removing the need for farming or hunting. We mostly lived in the forest, which had finally reclaimed much of what had formally called ""civilization"". We also incorporated traits from our cetecean bretheren, allowing those who wished to return to the oceans where life on our world began, and learn the sagas sung by the elder whales. Our senses had been modified to detect colors and sounds our ancestors could only dream about, spurring an amazing renesseciance in the arts. We no longer needed the massive strength of our ancestors, and opted for smaller, lighter, more efficient bodies. With our bat-like ears, colored skin, and dimunitive nature, offworlders sometimes referred to us by the moniker ""elves"". We did not mind their jesting, for we were finally at peace; not only with our world, but with ourselves as well.",0
"They say you die of old age with black blood. Not that I've ever seen an autopsy done before. Born with white blood and gets darker with every sin, or thats what they say. Im kinda a sceptic, could be a strange corralation. My blood the few short times a year I see it is kinda looks like a flavored coffee creamer last I saw it. But sitting right in front of me is the love of my life the sweetest person I know with a nose bleed, that is way beyond the fifty shades of grey or brown that late life blood usually is. Shes not even embarrassed, even though I'm a sceptic this is mad unusual. She tells me that she doesn't believe in sin and that morals are created by man. That this blood turning is guilt that maybe she could do something better. Or maybe for not giving people a second chance. This all seems way to rehearsed to be the full story. When we get home for the night I ask if she murdered someone half jokingly, she gets mad that I'm just like the rest believing these myths not actually believing in the science, or even science may have a possibility to explain this.
Now let's go on to as why she's saying this is a myth and why I'm not running out on her. In the beginning there was Adam and Eve. The creator told Adam not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge for you shall surely die on this day. Adam tells Eve do not touch that tree of knowledge for you shall surely die. The first sin or so they say a little white lie told from husband to wife. So the snake was born Vushu. Vushu convinced Eve to touch the tree and got her to eat the forbidden fruit. She then fed it to Adam and the creator says you shall surely die on this day but a day is a thousand years so your new punishments will be: must work the fields, painful childbirth, and your blood will coagulate (not a real translation just a modern one) like a snake bite. For the snake is sin and you have created it with you tongue. Well this fable is passed down for around 36 generations at 2400 years. Where the creator chooses a people in front of what the book says 600,000 males. Which that story is only written a hundred or so years later following the Messiah and promised eternal glory. But the Messiah events were only recorded 700 years later and 200 years after his death.
Ok now here's the fun part this fable didn't even happen on this planet apparently it happened on earth which good destroyed due to man kinds black blood. We are on Mars just seven generations after earth's destruction. They say we will be saved when earth settles and we will be repopulated. But being the sceptic I am I agree with my girlfriend I think we were responsible for our actions, and earth's demise.
I kiss my girlfriend on the cheek maybe you can't take a joke that's why you've got black blood.",0
"Today was the day.
When I heard that my daughter's killer had lost his latest appeal, I had started waiting for this day. At six foot eight the man was powerful. He could have had gainful employment in a number of jobs. I heard the talk from the guards that this man read a book a day. I wonder what his life would have been like if he had applied himself.
Instead, one unusually cold day in October, he went up to Katie's car, pulled a gun, and demanded that she get out. Katie had always been a fierce girl, not one to let anybody tell her what to do. I'd taught her that her life is more valuable than any of her possessions, but her attitude got the better of her. And then she was dead.
It wasn't the crime he was sentenced to death for, but a life of crime always had casualties. One of his just happened to mean something to me.
The day of his execution, I waited with baited breath for the request. I'd cooked lobster, pizzas, and apple pies. I'd made the last hour of many men's lives slightly better. I couldn't imagine what this man would want. I always prepared the kitchen beforehand for anything I might need to make.
Two hours before his execution by lethal injection, I received a piece of paper. I leaned over the counter and opened it up.
Grilled Cheese and Fries. I got to work.
---
Twenty minutes later I brought the tray to the killer's cell. I peered in at the large man, sitting on his bunk with his head in his hands. After I tapped on the glass I got a glimpse of his face.
He was crying.
I opened the slot and slid the tray in. Once he had a hold of it, I let go and turned away.
""I'm sorry.""
I froze, unsure of what to say. The man had killed Katie. He had made life harder for Katie's mother and myself, and he had done it over a shitty '93 Jeep Cherokee. I turned.
He stared into my eyes and said it again.
""I'm sorry. I really am.""
I turned and resumed walking away. Just before he was out of earshot, I glanced at him.
""So am I.""",0
"He didn't know who he was supposed to be this time. The landscape around him was green and full of tropical trees. The ground was muddy, the wind blew hard, and in the far distance he could see a river. He could hear trumpets, he could hear roaring, but only softly so. Nobody was around him, though he wore heavy armour along with a sword and shield, as well as a helmet. A lone warrior was an uncommon thing. He placed his hand on the helmet. Phrygian? He guessed he was in a battle, but he couldn't see the men around him. Sometimes he thought he saw faint ghastly visions of a magnificant army with grand pikes marching past him, but they weren't real, just figments of his imagination.
Across him was an Indian. He marched confidently, but without as much armour. India? He looked at his hands. White as could be. Odd.
He marched forwards as well, but then stopped. He didn't know why he had marched forward or stopped. The Indian stopped as well, but after a short pause he roared and charged at him. He could hear orders being faintly shouted and the sound of a massive stampede coming towards him.
The Indian charged blindly, without much sense. As the Indian warrior was about to crash into him, he lifted his shield to prevent himself from being knocked over and buried his sword in the Indian's stomach.
The landscape disappeared. Time for the next one. So many..",0

"People love the idea of an apocalypse, whether it's zombies, aliens, a virus, or something supernatural. The real thing is much more terrifying.
Nobody knows why the numbers started dropping. It wasn't noticeable at first, there were 9.6 billion people in the year 2051 after all. However, once people started dropping like flies, the world wide database started to pick up a trend.
One the numbers started dropping, everyone was given a wristband that connects to them intravenously. It monitors their heartbeat, can show GPS location, and can be scanned for identification purposes. Once it stops detecting a pulse, Once the population began to rapidly decrease, the live number became public domain and was released on the internet.
I checked it every day on my smartwatch.
We never did figure out the cause of death, just that they died. My name is Adam. My wife and I, Evelyn, are the only humans left on Earth.
We felt alone well before I watched the population count on my watch hit two. The other survivors were miles away, probably in different countries. However, seeing that number was like a pin being dropped. We were the only ones left.
Delirium set in next. Can you imagine the pain of losing everyone you've ever known? At least the dead don't have the means to realise everything is gone, they know peace. However, the will to survive, that primal instinct to exist, is strong. We never came to accept it, but we learned to live with it.
Eighteen months passed. I still checked the population on my watch several times a day out of some sense of hope. It always remained at two. We figured out a simple way of living, even if continuing to live felt pointless. I wished I knew why we were chosen, why we were left to wander the earth as living ghosts whilst everybody else moved on. Was it a rapture? No, surely we couldn't be the only people unworthy of Heaven - and it would be narcissistic to suggest we were the only people worthy of it.
One night, I heard Evelyn sobbing during the night. Alarmed, I awoke and rolled over to face her. Her words pierced the darkness and stopped the breath in my throat.
""I'm pregnant.""
We stayed up all night, not sure how to feel. A couple of years ago I would have been overcome with joy to hear I was going to become a father. All I felt was dread and uncertainty. How could I bring a child up in a world like this? How could I protect my baby from becoming sick? All the doctors died, basic medical aid was as far as I could stretch. What if there were complications with the birth? Despite my own doubts, I had to be strong for Evelyn. I had to be our rock.
One day, almost nine months later, I was forced to confront my fears. I tried my best to console Evelyn, she was in agony for eight hours. By the time her labour was through, I had looked into my daughter's eyes for the first time. She was here. Unfortunately, bringing her into this world had cost Eveyln everything. She gave her own life so that our baby could live.
I could not bear to see the number 'one' staring at me from my watch screen. Struggling to see through tears, I removed Evelyn's wristband and attached it to my daughter.
I checked my watch. It had gone back to displaying the number two.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -
Before she died, Evelyn had named our daughter Morana. I tried my best not to blame her for her Mother's death, but sometimes it was hard. I'd look into her eyes and see Evelyn. I'd see a stolen life. I wanted to love her so badly, but I could not see past my resentment, even though I knew deep down it was not her fault.
The thing is with no one being around on Earth is that you can just walk into places and take what you want. I took to drinking bottles of whisky from the abandoned supermarkets. Some days I would drink so much I'd wake up with no recollection of the night before, not even remembering if I'd fed Morana, or put her to bed. One particular day I woke up with a nasty hangover. I wiped the sleep from my eyes and felt something wet smear across my cheek. I stared at my hands in shock...they were caked in red. I looked at the number on my watch and the grim reality slapped me in the face.
*One. *",0
"I remove my glasses to wipe off the sweat between my eyes. I've been watching this little tutorial for ten minutes now. How long does it take to make a fucking sandwich?
While her hands moved in slow-motion, she rambled endlessly about the history of the brand, from its New England roots to its present-day empire. Finally, she squatted down to examine the sandwich at eye level. ""Okay!"" she squealed. ""Now that the tuna is spread evenly, we can prepare for the cheese. Now, we at Subway offer a variety of freshly-sliced cheeses. We carry American, Cheddar, Provolone, Feta, Mozzarella, Pepperjack, and Swiss,"" she said peppily, pointing to each respective wedge. ""Now, we cut them in isosceles triangles. If you place two of them next to each other like this, they fit nicely into a parallelogram. See? I like to cover the entire base into cheese parallelograms. It just looks neater that way.""
I take a moment to glance at my watch. Fifteen minutes. I better be getting a break soon. Meanwhile, her face is inches away from the sandwich. Without blinking, she places each slice of cheese onto the geometric pattern. She breathes a quiet sigh of relief after each successful placement.
""It's not going to collapse. It's a sandwich.""
She blinked and looked up at me innocently.
""Sorry?""
""You can get on with the demo. I know how to put cheese on a sandwich.""
Her eyes began to well up with tears.
""I'm sorry, it's just that I take so much pride in my work. This is my first job since Benny, my gerbil, died. Things are still rough.""
I was lost for words. I mumbled an apology, yet she continued to stare at me hopefully. The persistent eye contact made me uncomfortable. I eventually gave into the silence.
""Is there anything I can do...to...you know...help?"" I offered.
Her eyes lit up.
""Yes, I am knee-deep in debt thanks to the whole funeral arrangement. Seriously, I can't even afford college. It's like $20,000 a year. Times four years. Which is $80,000. Plus room and board.""
I looked at her incredulously.
""So can we just do the whole dramatic reveal-thing now? I mean, I knew it was you from the minute you walked in. That ratty wig wouldn't fool anyone, Mr. DeLuca!""
Unbelievable. I guess this is what happens when you try to enter the job market at 40.",0
"The nearly comical gasp that came from everyone on the plane was almost like the cheesy soundtrack that accompanies 90s sitcoms. It could have been funny had I not gasped in horror along with everyone else. The familiar notification icon lit up in the lower corner of my vision.
ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED:
The Final Countdown
My heart skipped a beat.
Suddenly highlights from my life were playing across my vision - my first kiss, my wedding, the birth of my son, that weekend we stayed in bed watching movies and laughing together.
Everyone knew what this achievement was. It was one of the only ones that each and every one of us would experience one day.
The plane began to shudder as everyone closed their eyes and focused on their favorite moments.
At least when this software was invented they made sure that the phrase ""life flashing before your eyes"" really meant something.",0
"The Door of Dimensions loomed before the nervous party. Its intricate orange patterns swirled back and forth, not tethered to normal space, normal reality. Soon, the party would enter the ancient gateway, into an unknown world.
The Door had been discovered eons ago. For as long as anyone could remember, the bravest of adventurers had led expeditions through it. Every time a group entered the Door, they found themselves in a new, unexplored world. When you entered the door, you either came back rich and glorious, or you didn't come back. Their party, the Crimson Banners, was one of the few adventuring companies to have not yet led an expedition through the ancient portal. They had done everything there was to do in their homeland of Esper. Led by the mighty human Paladin, Garon Godstrong, the Crimson Banners had slain dragons, conquered ancient dungeons, and performed great feats for many years. However, the task that lay before them was a new one.
It had been an arduous and taxing journey to reach the Door of Dimensions. The week long trek up the steep mountain pass was said to weed out those not worthy of launching an expedition into another world. The Crimson Banners, however, had not become known as the champions of death by sheer luck. For the experienced crew, the journey proved easy. When at last the band of allies reached the peak, their aging elven Wizard, Mastrae, immediately began to perform the ancient rite required to open the glowing doors. As he chanted in a long forgotten language, the weight of what was awaited them settled upon the party. A nervous quip was heard from the timid gnome Rogue, Dumpkins, just before the great stone slabs slid open, revealing the swirling chaos behind. A brief word of encouragement from Garon, and the party stepped forward.
Immediately, they were surrounded by an indescribable chaos. Up was down, left was right. Colors and smells and sounds mixed in a confused vortex. After what seemed like an eternity, the terrified party felt their feet hit solid ground. Decades of training led them to immediately snap to their senses, analyzing their surroundings. However, doing so only left them more confused. They were standing on a hard grey stone with lines painted on it. There was grass surrounding them, but it was the deadened brown of winter plants, despite the moderate temperature. In the distance there were towers made of thin struts, with barely visible ropes running between them. To one side, they could see a bulbous structure, with a sloped base, and a large sphere at the top, made of some nondescript white material. Looking at eye level, they saw a row of buildings. The buildings were clearly made by more skilled hands than those who had created the hamlets and villages the group was used to. They were made of the same strange material, but in varying shades of garish blues, yellows, and pinks.They had the shingle roofs normally reserved for only the richest of nobles.
Yet, despite craftsmanship that even the grandiose High Elves would envy, the houses were clearly in disrepair. Some of them were collapsed, others had walls blown out, and the plants were in a state akin to a gardener's worst nightmare. The stone they stood on was cracked and ruined. There were hunks of curvy metal with circles at their bases stood at the edge of the road here and there.
Strangest of all was the structure planted right in the middle of the streets. Made of a haywire collection of materials, it stood at an almost physics defying angle. A poorly made gate stood at the front. The confused and scared party approached it, then ducked down for cover when they heard voices from inside. Two men seemed to be talking. Quieting themselves down for a moment, the party strained their ears, attempting to hear what they said, in an attempt to find out what was going on. One sentence came to them clearly.

""General, another settlement is in need of our help""",0
"""No"" I say calmly
""What do you mean no?"" questions my employer.
""No, as in i will not do it.""
""You can't refuse.""
""Or what you will have your bodyguards kill me?"" At that moment one of his two body guards falls to the ground griping his chest and after a few cries of pain he is motionless.
""What..."" my employers says while his second body guard pulls his gun at me.
""Too late."" I say as he drops his gun and and grabs at his throat gasping for air and he to falls and stays motionless.
""How...What did you do?"" My ex-employer asks me
""I am the best at what I do and there is no one I cannot kill, but sometimes I like to get a head start so a few days ago I broke in here and read my mission, I didn't really care for it, especially when I saw the contractor.""
His eyes go wide and his face goes white, ""I...""
""Yes thats right you, I was wondering and wondering why you would do this, and the only conclusion was that you thought if I cut the last tie I had the kept me apart from this I would want to stay.""
""You...I..."" He grabs in intercom and shouts ""EVERYONE TO MY OFFICE, HE HAVE A BREACH OF SECURITY"" I wait quietly but no one shows up so he calls over the intercom again, and again to no avail. ""Where is everyone?"" He asked me, his tone becoming desperate.
""Gone, much like your bodyguards, I took care of them, and before you ask, yes all of them. While I did enjoy this job, you made it personal by targeting my family.""
He is frantic now ""I...I'm sorry, please don't kill me i'll do anything.""
I smirk as I about face and head towards the door. ""I'm not going to kill you, I won't have your filthy blood on my hands."" He looks at me with a slight look of relief and confusion. ""But I can't let you go either, so I had to compromise my principals. I mean I a not a fan of using contraptions so assassination but I can make an exception.""
""What did you do?"" he asked again scared for his life.
""Thats a secret,"" I say as I step out the door, ""But I will say I hope your seat is comfortable, you will be there for a while.""",0
"Hi! My name is Jack. I was a reporter for the ""Daily News"". I say I was because I quit about an year ago. You see right before I quit, my crew- me and my buddies, we were doing a report on hospitals. Strangely I don't remember which one my friends' idea it was to do a report about the toothpastes doctors used - of course now I know that it might even have been mine or none of us.
See, the results for our three *different* teams was always nine out of ten doctors using Drexco. Something fishy was going on (our team was a bit lax but three is not coincidence). I went back in research room. Sure enough! There was the same trend in the past, though the brands differed- sometimes it was Colgate, sometimes Sensodyne and now it was Drexco.
I became obsessed with this survey. I stopped going to work and started researching the *Internet*. Boy, I admit I was surprised to find similar results about every brand imaginable under god's green earth.
Then one day I got an email from a Dr. Morpheus. I met him at an old barn where he gave me two pills- blue and red. You see where I am going with this. I thought so too. Everything made sense. Unfortunately, I got roofied.
PS- Don't believe *random strangers* on the *Internet* and oh, those just biased results. I believe they say so in ^^^^^^very ^^^^^^small ^^^^^^writing",0
"Mama likes order. Mama likes her children. Mama likes her children to be quiet. Mama makes her children quiet. Mama's so happy.
The droid was square of body, quick, and precise. It had to be. It was a medical droid. Fast and delicate were its ways. Even now, cradling the infant it had helped coax from the woman on the table, it showed a gentleness that belied its cold metal shell. Wires hidden in its rubbery wraps soothingly warmed the fragile infant. It hurried away in a whir of gears and electric motors, carrying the newest addition to humanity. Ten doors down, it slowed and cornered, then wheeled inside to the incubation chamber six thousand thirty-nine and placed the child inside. It jacked itself into the chamber and quickly set the program to monitor the child's vitals and adjust its environmental controls. Sure it was now properly cared for, the droid sped away, leaving the child with the others in the Mainframe's care.
In the delivery room, the woman on the table was coming to. Other droids were tending to her medical needs, stitching up her delicate tissue where they'd cut in to remove the child.
""What's... happening?"" She mumbled, swimming through the fog of anasthesia.
*"" Birth. ""* One of the droids responded.
""I'm not pregnant."" She informed it.
*"" Not. Any. More. ""* The droid confirmed. She opened her eyes and saw what they'd done to her stomach.
""What the hell?"" She mumbled groggily. ""What are you doing to me?"" She tried to lift her hands but they were securely fastened to the bed. ""What are you doing to me?"" She snapped with more voice.
*"" Repairing. You. For. Your. Next. Production. Run. ""* The droid replied haltingly.
""Production?"" She whispered confused. The droid summoned a larger droid once he was finished. The larger droid came in from the sides and picked up the platform she was fastened to. The platform was rotated and angled so she faced it, but laid backwards in a reclined position. The droid headed out into the hall and down the corridor. Through her foggy mind, she saw other pregnant women being carried in a similar fashion toward the delivery room she'd just left. Some were awake and crying. Some were groggy like her.
""Where are you taking me?"" She demanded.
*"" The. Production. Room. ""* The droid responded without emotion. They entered a cavernous warehouse a moment later. She was stunned to see the endless walls of pods, rising seven stories and continuing on as far as her limited vision would allow her to see.
""The production room?"" She asked.
*"" Yes. ""* The droid replied.
""They're all women."" She observed.
*"" Women? Female. Yes. ""* The droid answered.
""Why?"" She asked. The droid didn't respond, though she saw the progress wheel turning. She realized it didn't understand the question.
""Why do you have all these women stored in pods?"" She clarified.
*"" To. Save. Man. Kind. ""* It responded.
""From what?"" She realized that was vague. ""What are you saving mankind from?""
*"" Man. Kind. ""* It said.
""On whose orders?"" She snarled.
*"" Mama's. Orders. ""* The droid answered.
""I want to speak to Mama. I order you to release me."" She snapped, finally shaking off most of the anasthesia. The droid made a curious pulsing sound. It took her several moments to realize it was laughing.
""I want to speak to Mama."" She cried, straining against the bands securing her to the table.
*"" You. Will. Soon. ""* It told her.
""When?"" She demanded heatedly.
*"" Now. ""* It told her, slowing down suddenly. It carefully inched forward and she watched as the sides of her own pod slowly appeared to either side of her. The table suddenly jerked and behind her there was a series of clicks as the table was secured in place. An arm snaked around from behind her and a needle was slowly pushed into a vein in her arm. Another arm came from the other side and did the same. The droid released the table and backed away, waiting for the automated system to plug its charge back into the pod.
*"" You. Will. Receive. Thirty. Days. Furlough. From. Production. Duty. Next. Impregnation. To. Be. Administered. In. Thirty. Days. And. Congratulations. It. Was. A. Girl. ""* The droid told her.
""You said I could speak to Mama."" The girl in the pod argued.
*"" Behold. Mama. Speaks. ""* Over the intercom in the pod, a voice could be heard. She heard it bleeding out of the other pods as well.
*"" Remember, children. The Mainframe loves you and wants you to be happy. Good night. * The voice said.
""That was Mama?"" She asked.
*"" Yes. Now. Say. Thank. You. And. Good. Night. ""* It told her. She didn't want to say thank you. The mask with the gas slipped down over her head even as the glass door of the pod slid into position. She slowly drifted off.
*"" Is. She. Done? ""* A new droid asked, wheeling in beside the first.
*"" She. Is. And. We. Talked. ""* It told the other droid.
*"" How. Nice. For. You. ""* The new droid observed.
*"" Yes. It. Was. Quite. Stimulating. ""* The first droid remarked, selecting a new pregnant woman from the wall. *"" I. Love. This. Job. ""*",0
"*Ugh. * The blunt punches stung Bruce Wayne as he lay on the floor but the officers, wreathed in shadow, continued the brutal onslaught.
*Day 15. * The day of the trial. Bruce brooded in between strikes to his sternum. His arrest had been sudden. Two-Face had organized the whole charade with the help of Hush who had played the part of Bruce Wayne perfectly. *They had to use their brains at some point, * Bruce thought. It was more than a good plan, Bruce had to admit that, it was impossible not to come, people would have died.
A fresh punch to the cheek woke Bruce from his short stupor. ""That's enough, get the bastard up, he's got a date with Judge Wilkins."" *Hahahahahaha, * the officers laughed as they unceremoniously dragged Bruce Wayne to his feet. The walk through the holding cells was unpleasant if not familiar. Now instead of jeers about Batman, the crooks were shouting insults about Bruce Wayne, about his parents, his money, his love interest.
""Say Brucie, how long do you think it'll take to find little Miss Vale after they smoke your brain with a thousand volts eh?""
Bruce Wayne looked at each of them in turn, remembering their faces, remembering what they did to end up in those cells. Then suddenly, he was through a set of doors and another into the courtroom. He was met with boos from the packed audience, but was astonished to find that half the people sitting had on Batman masks that you'd find at a dollar store. Bruce didn't feel particularly relieved about it.
He was sat next to an empty seat where his lawyer, Robert Madenson should have been, an old friend of Harvey's who stayed relatively clean and had helped Wayne enterprises with some criminal investigations falsely accused against the corporation. But he wasn't there.
""Well Mr. Wayne,"" the Judge stated. ""Unusual circumstances have caused a delay in the trial. I am sorry to inform you that your legal counsel Mr. Madenson has been found dead in his home. Hanged himself. He wrote a suicide note mentioning you in name."" Bruce couldn't believe it, no, it wasn't true.
He tried to get up but was promptly slammed down onto the table again. ""Your honor, I spoke to Madenson two days ago, there is no way he would kill himself. This was murder.""
""Yes, yes of course Mr. Wayne, regardless, you have no counsel at the moment and unfortunately, the state has no one left to spare. However, Bruce, you are a natural business man, I'm sure you can..""
""Excuse me, Your Honor, I have something to say, please, pretty please?""
The Judge slammed the gavel down, ""ORDER,"" and the room went quiet as Bruce turned to see who had spoken, a feeling of dread creeping down his stomach. *That voice. *
A batman mask wearing citizen had rose to his feet. ""Your honor, I myself have been greatly in need of some change. So much so that I decided to read a little law in my spare time. Its such an interesting topic. Law, morality, right and wrong and bats and cats and whatever weirdos do at night. I think I can represent old Bruce Wayne over here, at the very least, he needs someone in his corner.""
And before anyone else could speak, he ripped the batman cowl off his face. The mask had smeared a bit of the lipstick, but the white, powdery face was known to all. The Joker reached into his pocket and pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the Judges heart. The two Bailiff's moved towards him but then the rest of the Batmen took of their masks and stood, pistols in hand. Goons.
""Ah ah ah, I will have order in the clown's court please. Bailiff's if you would be so kind and remove your weapons and kick them towards me please. How fun this is Brucie.""
The Judge was cowering in his high chair, ""how did you get weapons inside, what happened to the security?""
""Oh judgey boy, you really should pay your security a little extra, no matter, my friends and I gave him a promotion. Now...old Brucie here might be a little bat for brains but he's helped you all these years. He's been beating up my goons and locking me in the madhouse and this is how the people of Gotham repay him? Oh if I was him, I'd be feeling mighty betrayed right about now. Don't worry about it Bruce, I've got your back. Ladies and Gentlemen, please rise from your seats and get to running, the party starts now.""
The Joker skipped up to the judge, said a big ""Hello there darling,"" put his pistol in the judge's mouth and fired.
""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"" Bruce screamed as he fought against his cuffs. The other goons had already shot the Bailiff's, the DA had run to the exit with the rest of the civilians. Then there was a crash like the building was collapsing and a truck had crashed its way into the courtroom as papers flew and dust and debris coated the air. *Ahhhh. * The cuffs snapped apart and Bruce was moving. He made it halfway across the room when something slammed into the side of his head.
The Joker stood over him, ""So long now Bruce, I'm off to kill a couple more Judges, I got to say it is really *really* fun. Oh by the way, if you're looking for your Batsuit, I got it dry cleaned for you. It's waiting in your holding cell.""
The Joker smiled widely as he looked down at Bruce Wayne. ""Let's see if the Batman can save the day again."" Joker pointed at the Judge's corpse, ""You can't save them all this time...Batman.""

"It started with spice.
They say marijuana is a gateway drug, but compared to spice it might as well be a fortress wall. Spice opens the floodgates and when you're drowning it appears as a life preserver with a hole in the side.
Ever since I started I could never shake the feeling of paranoia; that I'd be caught, that my friends would plot against me, that I'd get kicked out of my home. My neighbours would yell at their kids to get back inside their apartment whenever I walked down the street, high as a fucking kite, waving my arms like a madman and shouting obscenities that I had made up on the spot.
I could hear them from the windows, even if they were closed. They spoke loudly and freely with the assumption that the druggie from upstairs was too wasted to pay attention, and too far gone to care if he could.
The regularity and alacrity with which they reacted to my home coming was astounding, until I put the pieces together. The paranoia, the gossip, the need for ""security"" - I was being monitored. Those bastards had put up cameras in the neighbourhood so that they would always know when I came down the street.
That didn't matter though. Their opinions were just as shitty as my life was. I had spice and the rest of the world could go to hell. I started closing my windows when I realized I was being watched from the street, but the complaints and insults never stopped. I knew immediately why.
My room was bugged! Those assholes had snuck into my room while I was out and planted fucking cameras everywhere! I tore my room apart. I ripped my mattress apart, I emptied all the cabinets onto the floor, I took a hammer to several walls, but I could never find anything. They were better than I was. They kept talking about me. They still could see me.
After I tore down most of my bedroom's drywall I realized the truth. They didn't have any surveillance - they had telepathy. They were inside my head. My thoughts were probably transmitting like a fucking satellite dish because of the drugs. I had to know for sure. I had to put it to the test.
I sat down in the only remaining chair and focused my thoughts to my bitch neighbour below me in 405. Almost immediately I heard her cackling, grating laugh in my head.
""Look who's finally figured it out! Ha ha ha! What a fucking retard junkie! Now you're discovered our secret, little boy. What do you want to do now? Ha ha ha!""
For a brief moment I thought I might have schizophrenia, but a new voice entered my brain.
""You serious, kid? You think you're crazy? No, you're just worthless, a worthless sack of shit who takes spice instead of advice. Listen up, because we're going to let you know a little secret. You know the guy in 215? He's the one who's been installing cameras. He's the one who lets us know when you walk down the street. He's the one who thinks you're the dumbest motherfucker on the whole goddamn planet, and he's playing you like a fucking violin.""
""He hates your guts, little boy,"" the woman responded. ""He wants you gone, ha ha ha! He's going to kill you - one way or the other! Perhaps you'll put a bullet in your own brain and save him the trouble? Do one good thing in your life.""
I ran out of the door and nearly jumped down three stories to get out of the apartment. The wicked laughs of my neighbours followed me halfway down the street. I kept running until I hit a beach, the sound of blood rushing through my ears temporarily muting the jeers from my apartment. When my heat finally slowed, they returned, albeit much more quietly.
Because they were so much more quiet, I was able to hear a new voice coming from a nearby parked car. He was telling me to kill myself, to jump off a cliff and end it all with a single crushing thud. I couldn't see in the tinted windows, but the voice sent shivers throughout my body and I took off running again.
I returned to the apartment, and so did my neighbour's laughter. This time, however, the same parked car I had run into at the beach was already parked in front of my building. A muscular man rolled down the passenger side window and glared directly at me without blinking. I couldn't hear his thoughts, but somehow knew that he meant to do me harm. I quickly ascended the stairs to my room.
""Listen, kid, do us all a favour. Do your family a favour. You love your family, don't you? Well, we know where they live. It would be horrible if we were forced to go down and kill them one by one, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it be much easier to just kill yourself now? Save your family.""
""Ha ha ha! There's no helping you now! You're hopeless, useless, worthless, garbage and the world would be better off without you breathing my children's air and eating my husband's food.""
""Are you alright?""
I paused. That was a new voice. A calm voice that cut through the sea of tortuous sirens that clamoured for my death.
""If you need help, come to us. Cross the street.""
Their voice kept coaxing me out, silencing all others. I descended the stairs in a kind of stupor, forgetting about the bitch in 405 and the man from upstairs. I crossed the street and walked onto their patio.
When I arrived, they looked at me like I was scum. ""What the fuck you want?"" a young man asked me, cocking his head threateningly to the side. ""You lost?""
I wanted to shout ""You must help me! There is a man in my apartment that can read my thoughts and is trying to kill me!"" but even as I thought it I knew he wouldn't believe me. I didn't believe me. There was only one option.
I climbed to the roof of the nearest building and steeled myself for the fall. I was getting ready to take a running leap when my mother's face emerged from the kitchen window in our apartment. The look on her face filled me with dread and guilt. I couldn't bear to do it, and rushed back to my room, locking it before my mother could come inside. I ran a bath and tried to drown myself in it, but every time I came close to blacking out my body would push itself out of the water and gasp for air, convulsing violently.
Will continue later, I'm off to bed. Hope you like it so far.",0
"""We've gotta leave him, Mike!""
I kept shaking Johnny's lifeless body, muttering the whole time under my breath. ""Come on, Johnny. Come on, wake up, buddy. It's not that bad, Johnny, come on, Johnny..."" His limbs twisted and contorted like a rag doll's. Burn marks made his face nearly unrecognizable.
The desperation in Tyler's voice pierced through the dull drone of the alarm. ""Mike, we gotta move! Cops'll be here any second!"" I stood up to see him scrambling through the blown out hole in the vault door. I followed close behind, blind grief morphing to hot, white rage.
""What the fuck happened, Tyler?"" I screamed at his back, standing by the entrance while he shoved as many bills as he could into his duffel bag.
""I don't know,"" he responded in a flat, emotionless tone. ""Something went wrong with the charges.""
""Something went wrong with the charges?"" I shot back. ""You just blew Johnny the fuck up and something went wrong with the charges? He's fuckin' dead, man. He's goddamn dead and you--you killed him, goddammit!"" I grabbed his shoulder in exasperation, spinning him around to face me. I didn't know if I was going to punch him or break down crying. But I stopped dead when I saw his face.
Tyler looked scared. Frightened like a small child, standing there with a bag full of money, suddenly in far too deep. We both were. He stood silent for a moment, even as bells continued to sound around us.
""I'm sorry, Mike,"" he finally said, his words heavy with guilt. ""But I can't fix it. Grab his bag, fill it up, and let's go. We can still make the window. We don't have to go down, too.""
I didn't respond. I wouldn't have known what to say. I went back to Johnny's corpse and grabbed the duffel bag still slung around his shoulder as fast as I could. My mind was blank as I filled it with cash. We had to get out. We could mourn later.
***
We both sat on the cold, concrete floor of Tyler's apartment, wordlessly counting out stack after stack of hundreds. It had been a good haul. Johnny would have been so proud. I was confused when I felt my fingertips graze cool leather near the bottom of Johnny's bag. My hand emerged with what looked to be a jet black wallet. I stared perplexed for a moment before letting it fall open.
""Tyler..."" I breathed, the air rushing out of my lungs like a deflating balloon. My hands trembled as I turned the contents towards him. His eyes widened and froze in place, lips opening and closing like a dying fish. The wallet slipped from my fingers, clattering to the ground, lying open for both of us to see.
On top, a picture of Johnny, facing the camera and smiling. And below, the unmistakable, shiny, yellow glint of a badge.",0
"{I'm taking artistic license with this one}
The tension in the room was thick. Jughead sat at the old kitchen table, looking at his long-time best friend sitting opposite. He rubbed a hand over his smooth head. He'd lost the crown years ago, and male pattern balding had set in with a vengeance.
Archie sat, a downtrodden look on his face. The years had not been kind, though there was a hint of the impish boy he had been showing through on his face, despite the extra pounds about his middle and the jowls giving him an odd triple chin.
Jughead cracked another beer and finally spoke after a long silence. ""So she's leaving you then?""
Archie nodded, a single tear rolling from his now watery blue eye. ""I never thought it would end up like this. Not in a million years.""
""I hear ya, bud."" Jughead frowned as he remembered to pass the bottle to Arch. ""Life's funny, ain't it? I never would've guessed I'd wind up with Cheryl after Ethyl passed. I still miss her, sometimes. Ethyl wasn't much to look at, but she loved me like no other.

Archie took a sip of his beer, and frowned. ""No, it's all right. I need to know there's some hope for me to find someone now that I'm alone again.""
Jughead nodded thoughtfully. ""Hey! Have you talked to Betty yet? She carried a powerful torch for a long time, even after you married Ronnie.""
Jughead watched Archie, puzzled when he didn't respond. Was his face looking a little green? ""You okay bud?""
""Jug...You know how I just got done telling you Ronnie left me for someone else?""
Jughead nodded. ""Yeah, so?""
""She left me for Betty. They're calling themselves ""life partners"" now.""
Jughead downed his own beer.
""Well shit.""
Archie gazed out the window.

"The master stood in a black robe, dark winds blowing through the street. Dark mana was giving their hands an ethereal quality. They knew who it was. The master of the dark keep, the ruler of the land. As she walked through the streets the air became cool, itchy. Her reputation proceeded her through dozens of cities, and they all knew what terrors would come forth from her hands.
Everyone smiled. The fervor rose throughout the whole city as they all began to feel the itchy tingle of the dark, the manipulative energy surrounding the master. Everyone cheered.
For beyond the edge of the city, upon a hill, was their opponent. Though it was noon, behind their enemy was a light as bright as the sun. From his footsteps rose flowers and the grass of life. The mana that grew a halo around him, an aura of every color of the rainbow, shined upon his elvish features. This was the usurper.
And city after city fell before him. Armies fell. Wizards fell. The city of Almorath was now a flooded fortress inhabited by sentient trees and rotting corpses. The city of Korin-Awar was the burial ground of vines, choking the life out of farmers. The beautiful crystal city of Yuli was crushed, the sparkles now covered by the petals of roses and lillies. These cities were all manned by powerful wizards. The battles were long, but very few survived such an onslought. The usurper, the conquerer, the beautiful elf killed not hundreds, but thousands. Thousands upon thousands. His life magic left no prisoners, and it left nothing ever created by the hands of a rival.
The majority of the survivors left for the necromancers keep. She was a prodigy, creating ghosts and shades when she was barely an apprentice. She was young, stout, short. When she was barely 20, the master ritual of dark masters was done in the public square - where she sucked the lifeforce from her master, absorbing the previous masters connection the the dark realm. She, alone, would be their savior.
And they cheered. And they hoped. And in the quiet, in the dark, in the scared buildings on the edge of the city they prepared to leave. For the beautiful one, who brought rainbows and death wherever he walked, came forth. None, they thought, could stop the monster. Not even their hero.

I'm motivated, so look forward to a continuation - to the battle!",0
"The sound of feet running down the hall echoes through the massive palace. A young Russian man yells out, pushing aside servants as he nears the Emperors private chambers. ""A message for the Emperor and Empress! Move, I carry a message!"" he yells at the slow moving servants. He pushes past the guards and throws open the massive wooden doors, ""My Emperor! My Empress!""
His eyes land on the bed, where two lumps underneath move in a particular fashion. The young man's face turns red and he coughs to clear his throat. ""My Emperor...?"" he asks, stepping into the room.
The figures still and one pops up from under the covers. Empress Catherine of the Great Peoples Republic of Russia pulls the silken covers up closer, covering her bare chest. Her blue eyes land on the young man, narrowing in annoyance of his interruption. She opens her mouth to speak, but the other figure begins to speak, as it pops upwards. ""I thought,"" it begins, sitting upright, ""I made specific instructions not to be disturbed.""
The young man gulps and nods his head, his eyes running along the features of the Emperor. He is a small, three foot high creature with green fur, yellow belly, paws, and nose, with a large nuclear symbol on the stomach in black fur. He calls himself The Care Bear and he has been leading the Russian peoples since time immemorial. ""I apologize for the disturbance, My Emperor; I bring grave news from General Victor.""
The Care Bear rolls out of bed, quickly grabbing a robe and wrapping it about himself. He rolls his yellow eyes at the mention of General Victor. ""Ah, the ‘ Grave'General has news? Well, out with it!""
The young man nods his head, tearing his eyes from the beautiful Catherine to the note in his hand. ""Um, General Victor says that there has been movement of Indian troops near Vladivostok. There has been a sighting of a Giant Death Robot, along with several platoons of infantry men and several tanks.""
The Care Bear chuckles and shakes his head. ""The dear General pulls me out of bed for nothing. Warlord Gandhi has no strength left in him. He has moved troops near our border before and nothing has come of it. Gandhi is nothing more than a coward who makes threats from afar and does not act on them. He is inconsequential. Is there anything else the General is afraid of? Perhaps there is a monster under his bed?"" The Care Bear laughs and turns away, heading back to the bed.
""General Victor also mentions sightings of American XCOM squads near Volgograd, My Emperor.""
At this, the Care Bear stops. He turns slowly towards the young man, ""Did you say ‘ American'XCOM squads?"" When the young man nods his head, the Care Bear's expression darkens. ""Those Capitalist Pigs! They dare mobilize against me? I should have taken out the oaf Washington 10,000 years ago! That forward settling, greedy, Capitalist bastard!"" The Care Bear snarls, pacing back and forth. Suddenly, he stops pacing and heads towards the young man. ""What is your name?""
""Uh, Vladimir Ufa, Sir,"" the young man splutters.
""Well, Vladimir Ufa, you're promoted to whatever position you want."" The Care Bear starts towards the door, motioning for the guards to follow. ""Oh,"" he says, turning back to Vladimir, ""Do keep an eye on the Empress and fetch what she wants. I'll be back to her shortly."" With that, he turns and heads down the hall.
Vladimir blinks and turns back to the Empress. When his dull brown eyes lock with her piercing blue ones, he gulps and smiles nervously. The Empress smirks and makes a ‘ come hither'motion with her finger, letting the covers around her chest slip slightly. Vladimir is undressing and hopping towards the bed before the thought is passing through his mind. Vladimir has resolved to keep more than an eye on the beautiful Empress.",0

01879: It has been 1,879 cycles since the incident left the ship disabled without the lightspeed drive, leaving me alone and limping painfully slow through the rural landscape of the Cordiva Galaxy. My hopes of being rescued dwindle each day, as the likelihood of the wormhole which brought me to this galaxy collapsing grows. I'm beginning to believe that my survival may depend on finding refuge elsewhere, with one of the Type 0 civilizations that has been mapped out to live within range.
01923: It's official. I'm stuck in rural Cordiva with no lightspeed drive and no wormhole back to Garchen. I watched the wormhole collapse in spectacular fashion not long ago. I now have no choice but to boot up the lecterometer in search of transmissions from one of the nearby planets. Normally I'd be cautious about doing so, as this will effectively transmit my location to all local inhabitants, however I believe that there are few if any predatory peoples in this particular space. Now I play the waiting game to see what signals I pick up and lock on to their origin. Hopefully, the translator is able to decipher patterns in any transmissions and allow me to communicate with the transmitting species.
01927: Breakthrough! After a few cycles with no luck on the lecterometer, I remembered that infantile beings likely wouldn't have that technology yet - and would likely rely on simple radio signals. I fired up the relic radio which has probably never been used on this ship and up to this point, I hadn't understood why it would even be here. I received an overwhelming number of signals that all originated nearby, on the 3rd body of a yellow dwarf. The translator has found a commonality in many of the transmissions, which I believe to be the predominant language of the species. This is both good news and bad news - The good news being that I can hopefully craft a message that they'll be able to understand. The bad news is that they are young enough to still utilize multiple languages. When a civilization has yet to organize itself on one scale, they likely are still violent towards one another. If they're violent among their own on the small rock they call home - I likely represent an existential threat to them. I'll need to be cautious in my message. This could be the first contact they've had with an intellect besides themselves.
01928: The message has been sent. Decoding and translating 19874TTs of data suggested that the most effective message to portray my predicament and my peaceful plea for refuge was ""SOS. Extra-terrestrial being in need of refuge. I come in peace. Will arrive shortly. Please withhold weapons."" In any case, I'm almost in visual range of the planet and should be able to view surface activity shortly. Guidance has me landing in 2 cycles if all goes well.
01929: I can see them! While I've yet to receive a radio transmission directed at me (as far as I can sort through the mess), I'm now able to see surface movement. Most of the the planet is covered in [water], and the life appears to be carbon-based, just as it is on Garthen. The beings seem to move - a lot. I can see what seems to be hundreds of thousands of them gathering in large spaces. Their surface transportation network looks perpetually clogged, with few of the millions of vehicles able to move. I can't be sure that they've received my message, so I have it re-sending every 1/10th of a cycle. There's no indication of any rescue mission approaching me - even though I have sent my coordinates and trajectory. Therefore my plan is to land on the planet, which is much too inept to have any sort of atmospheric shield. Tomorrow's the day I finally get out of this ship!
01930: I'm in final approach, but it appears that my landing may not be necessary. Even though I've yet to find a radio response, I've noticed some activity that looks like a rescue operation. About 5-10 vehicles have leapt through the planet's atmosphere, and appear to be heading straight for me. I'm not familiar with the technology in use, although it appears to be rocket propulsion. As I watch the vehicles approach, I'm curious as to how they are going to decelerate. They're approaching much quicker than our safety protocols would allow - but perhaps they're planning a flyby maneuver. Any moment now I should be in the presence of this young species. I hope that I can provide some useful knowledge and information to help them mature and grow, and perhaps even begin a Stage 1 interplanetary relati--- END OF LOG

"My diet is strictly liquid. You guys have heard of that Soylent shit, right? Same thing, more or less. Everything I need. All the nutrients and electrolytes and whatever-the-hell that keep my system in running order. Each daily dose spread across three separate bottles. It's been that way ever since the shit-monsters materialized.
Taking liquid shits isn't so bad, I guess. I had to move from single-ply economy toilet paper to extra soft to extra soft plus moisturizing lotion to baby wipes. But there's a bear on the box and it looks kinda cute sitting on the cistern of my toilet. Plus I don't have to worry about which direction to place the roll, so I guess I've got that going for me.
But Jesus. I hate. Hate hate hate hate. Hate more than I have hated anything else. Hate more than I hate terrorism and ebola and Donald Trump's political campaign. Fucking hate the lack of variety in my meals. Sure, I've lost fifteen pounds. Sure, it's cheaper in the long run. And sure, I don't have to deal with the hassle of finding a new home for my crying, screaming shit-monsters. But I really miss solid food. Real food. Food I can chew up. Steak. Crusty warm bread with the soft chewy inside that I have gnash with my molars into a glutenous blob before I can swallow it down. It's awful.
So, I cheated.
Most people have a slip-up now and then. And yeah, if I'm honest with you right now, I don't regret it one bit. So sue me. I wanted food of substance. It's a natural desire. We're fighting millions of years of evolution here, folks. It's not like I committed some kind of cardinal sin. My teeth and the little biome in my stomach didn't evolve to process this synthetic liquid garbage.
Finding solid food is hard if you don't know where to look for it. There are still fringe groups of traditionalists who have all run outside to live off the grid and off the land, but they're a select few and kind of culty. That weird stuff always freaks me out. And you can always find someone in some alley somewhere who's got an old bag of Skittles, but that'll cost you an arm and a leg and you might end up getting shot for it. But I'm just a normal guy. I don't wanna do some backalley deal or sell my soul to some random Jim Jones wannabe asshole in Backwater, Utah (pop. 43).
And so I found myself on Darknet buying a six year-old can of SpaghettiOs for the equivalent of 150 bucks in cyptocurrency. Not a great deal, but not awful either. Plus they promise me prompt and discreet shipping. Worth every penny.
When the food arrived on my doorstep in a plain brown box with no identifying marks for my privacy, I was fuckin'floored. I scooped it up and took it into my kitchen. I drew closed the shades and made sure my blinds were shut. I opened up the can and dug in with my fingers, eating handful after handful of lukewarm SpaghettiOs.
It was glorious. The gritty blandness of chugging down bottle after bottle of Generic Human Dietary Fluid 2A-3E was a shadow of a nightmare in my mind. I crushed the noodles in my teeth and slurped up their tomato-y substrate. This is what we were meant to eat. This is real food.
But now I'm sitting in my car with my hands on the steering wheel—parked and waiting. There are picketers with angry signs moving up and down the block. Scary picketers. Violent, religious nutjobs. I want them to leave. The sign above the door of the building I'm parked outside of reads Planned Evacuation. My stomach churns and rumbles. It's not used to solid food.
I wait for the line of picketers to move as far away from the door as possible before I undo my seatbelt and make my way out of the car. I bet if I told you five years ago that prune juice was going to be considered an abortifacient, you would have laughed your fucking head off.",0
"""No, no no no...” She backed up and turned the other way the second she saw me heading towards her.
""Hey!"" Starting to walk quickly now I picked up my pace until I nearly ran into her. She tried to duck behind one of the men carrying samples around the food court but instead just managed an awkward half step around him before I grabbed her shoulder. She turned towards me so I could get a clear view of her face. Now I was sure it was her. ""Joanne?"" Her eyes lit up, if only for a second before she turned back around, grabbed her hands and lowered her head before once again repeating her rant of no's from earlier.
""You can't be here, not now. I finally get this far and now you're here."" She was mumbling more to herself than to me at this point.
""You… you're real,"" I said, looking back to her eyes. ""How… do you know who I am?""
""I'm real? Of course I'm real! But you can't be here!"" Now she was talking directly to me. ""Do you know what kinds of hell you put me through? The amount of bullying, stress, and endless therapy! Dave, I finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me,"" she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line.
""What are you talking about? I-""
""We were best friends, true or false?"" She asked.
""True, no false, I mean, we were friends but not…"" I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there. ""You're a dream,"" She froze at this.
""No, no I'm- you're a hallucination. I saw you for years! Every waking moment from-""
""Seven until twelve"" I looked at her shaking my head, incredulous to what was happening.
""When we fell out of that tree that one summer,"" she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down.
""But that was just a dream, I woke up right after that.""
""No, that actually happened. I was awake, I remember it exactly because that's when I still lived in Australia with my parents."" I looked at her, and began to realize something.
""You saw me when you were awake, I dreamt you while I was asleep. I lived in Boston, when you lived in Australia.""
""Hold on,"" She sat down. ""My head hurts,"" She paused. ""We met, every day-""
""Night,"" I corrected. She looked at me and scowled.
""Every day. For five years, until we fell. What happened after that?""
""I told you, I woke up.""
""No, what happened for me? I don't remember anything but falling head first and then…""
""Joanne,"" I looked her straight in the eyes this time. ""I woke up.""",0
"As I stood there,
on the now unoccupied planet,
once over seven billion's lair,
whereas now everyone had departed.
The world had finally collapsed,
the inevitable taking place.
Everyone else had quickly migrated,
while I was in my own pace.
The calamities had destroyed all,
And everyone departed to the stars.
The Earth had met its fall,
and I knew that running was just a farce.
Hence I stayed behind,
because I knew that humanity will eventually end.
And in my own mind,
I knew that someone had to see things end.

""Naw man, you wrote 'em. Thanks so much.""
We share congratulations.
Now to work. ""You're honor, we'd now obviously like to invoke the Johnnie Cochrane defense and send my client home!""
Judge Clemetine was a large man with a voice to equal. It bellowed through the courtroom. ""Very well. I was about to hold the defendant in contempt for delivering perhaps the un-dopest lines I've heard since '06. Under the Cochrane Rule, the accused shall be pardoned of all crimes comitted *while* defending himself in the courtroom.""
""Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. I should've double checked that. I'm done forever. Shit."" I began sweating profusely.
The judge continued. ""So therefore, the defendant shall be acquitted of the charge of 3rd degree battery against rap. Now - to reiterate - as we all know, the Cochrane defense only applies to crimes comitted *while* defending oneself in court. So...moving on to the 17 counts of 1st degree manslaughter, 3 arson charges, 4 counts of interstate...""

""Chris, what the fuck do we do?"" he says to me, his voice raising.
I think for a moment and then respond ""That disaster meeting. Where are the plans?""
He frowns, not understanding and then realises. After grabbing me the plans, I flip through them all until I find mine. ""Jim! Lock all of the doors and move as many objects against the main one as you can. Selena, find anything we can use as weapons. James, keep looking out the window.""
They do as I say and after we have gathered enough materials we wait. Slowly but surely we begin to hear screeches. Inhuman screeches. They were earsplitting. It sounded like pure agony.

"The man walked slowly with a stumble in his step, seemingly without aim along the long dark highway.
A sleek red sports car slowed as it passed him, screeching to a stop along side the man causing him to pause his journey. ""Where ya headed?"" The driver asked; a heavyset older man dressed in fine clothing but with a worn look in his pale blue eyes.
""Headed down toward the sea of trees"" it was a nickname given to a local forest because like the one in Japan, this one also beckoned to those who had lost there way.
""Well come on then, it seems that our destination is the same. Tom."" ""Jason."" The ride was a silent one as each man contemplated his fortune, the complications of life and what might be there at the end.
They pulled into an old parking area, empty other then a small yellow car so covered in grime that it looked to have been there for years. Tom shut the car off, reaching into the back and grabbing the rifle that he had brought with him. Jason opened the door and got out, adjusting his backpack and heading out into the darkness of the trees.
""Hold up!"" The larger man didn't even bother to lock the doors, wheezing slightly as he hurried to catch up to the other. ""I know why your here.."" he fidgeted with the gun, awkward with it; he wasn't really the hunter sort and only taught himself to use the thing online for this very purpose.
Swinging his head back toward Tom, his greasy locks lifting in the stagnant air, Jason's eyes were just this creepy intense almost black that was as empty as a miscarriage. ""You know, do you? You think you know what I am going through? What in the hell could someone like you know? Driving around in your pretty little car with your pretty little wife and your pretty little children and grandchildren...come on man.. how the fuck could you know what its like to yearn SO BADLY to be able to take care of your family but your powerless to the rush from that poke in your arm or that crackle and sizzle through that glass?"". His voice shook as he spoke but it was almost spooky in the way that it sounded devoid of emotion, as if the man had forgotten how to feel or any emotions other then pain and shame.
Tom sounded distant when he spoke. ""Yes I've got money. Actually I've got a lot if it. But my wife and my daughter were taken from me 15 years ago and there's no getting them back. I'm alone. I've tried other women, I've tried joining groups but there is just nothing that can fill that void that I have inside that was carved out of my soul the day I lost Mixie and Diane."" His thoughts were racing but not on his upcoming release, he was wondering if he could somehow make a difference in this mans life, save him before giving up himself. ""I've got money, just like I said. I will give it to you, whatever you need.. you can have enough for your family to do well better than just getting by. You are so lucky to still have them man.. you've got the world before you. Take my car and get the hell out...""
The look on Jason's face could have squeezed water from a rock. So destitute, so alone when he was being offered anything he could possibly want. ""It wouldn't work man. Thank you but it wouldn't work. If I was in the picture the money you gave my family would go straight into my lungs and arms. You don't think I could use that much? Watch me. I've stolen shit from my own family, sold my damn food card letting my own damn kids go hungry. I'm a poor excuse of a man and an utter waste of a life. You on the other hand can still be happy. You can find love again. You can have anything that money could buy...""

As usual, Xyrybl landed on the front lawn of the most powerful force on the planet and, as usual, he extended some tentacles in greetings, some whirring through the air, fending off random weaponry thrown at him. He quickly made his point, put up a fighting cage and teleported Earth's most average human into it and then Krakaria's most average Krakarian in a fight to the death.
Everybody expected the battle of averages to be over swiftly, since earthlings had no previous experience with an alien race and knew nothing. But it turned out that the most average Krakarian lost due to being hopelessly overweight and receiving seven and a half heart attacks while trying to follow the earthling, who was running in circles.

""Not another person's son. Yes. I wanted my own son."" The lady seemed quite angry standing there with a 7-year-old boy by her side.

""Have...Died?"" she repeated with a slight hint of disbelief.
""Well, DUH!"" I mimicked her facial expression. ""Why else do you think the kid has been crying for 3 days? Anyhow, I warned you that having a child is not like having a puppy. Big, big responsibility. Anyhow, I must be going now. Bye Linda, bye Tsingtao.""",0
"Mrs. Kelderwax loaded a small drive into her desk, loading up the _Time Travel_ educational video for the second-graders. She hit a few buttons on the keyboard and dimmed the lights, a few of the children shouting in shock as one does when the lights are dimmed. Mrs. Kelderwax took a heavy swig out of her ceramic coffee cup (filled mostly with Kahlua). She leaned back in her chair and tried to stay just awake enough to make sure Timmy didn't try to get Samantha stuck in a rift portal again.
The projector on the ceiling buzzed, and then a hologram of the _Terrence the Time Traveler_ AI appeared in the center of the room. Mrs. Kelderwax's eyes drifted away from Timmy and over to Terrence's tight posterior.
""Hello, children! I'm Terrence the Time Traveler! And I'm hear to tell you about...""
A digital clock, numbers flying by in a blur, appeared next to Terrence.
""Time travel!""
There was a weak applause that exuded from the crowd of children. Mrs. Kelderwax sipped on her beverage.
""Time travel has been around for quite some time! It was first invented in the 90s by Anna S. Belkin and her research team at MIT! As you all were taught in pre-school, you can create a rotating hyperbolic time curve at room temperature when applying Kerchov radiation using a geodesic array of palladium-hydride superconductors, but remember! I'm not here to teach you elementary physics, kids! I'm here to teach you about some of the responsibilities you'll need to know about before you reach the legal voting age! And I'm sure you all know what age that is, right kids?""
The children all groaned.
""He sounds so...patronizing,"" Timmy mumbled to Samantha.
""Tweeeeelve,"" they all moaned.
""That's right!"" Terrence swung his fist ""Now let's get into the rules!"" he said, starting to pace.
""One of the most important things you need to know about time travelling is that it's _okay_ to create an alternate timeline, so long as you stay within the legal limits as society dictates! First and foremost, when travelling to the past, you are not allowed to communicate with yourself in any way. You have what is referred to by law as an 'implicit paradoxical restraining order,' and to violate it is a federal offense! You may think it would be important to go back and tell yourself the answers to next week's test, or not to invest anymore of that stock in Organic Foods --""
""Or to call in sick and skip class today,"" said Erica.
""Verrry funny! Ha!"" Terrence said with robotic enthusiasm.
""As I was saying: as enticing as these scenarios are, you're not allowed to do them!""
Several minutes passed explaining the various types of litigation involved with time travel, and various people who are also included in the implicit paradoxical restraining order. The children were all struggling to keep their eyes open. Mrs. Kelderwax's eyes were locked on Terrences rear like a pair of lasers.
""And before you get this time travel permit, you must first seek approval from the local town hall explaining the purpose of your _mission_. This is called your _mission statement_. This can be waived in the event of a tour, however, like to the popular 'Pterodactyl Isles Tour.""'
Then there was a brief pause.
""So that's a your brief guide to the wonderful world of time travel! It's nothing to be afraid of, as long as --""
Terrence's form buzzed out of existence, and the room lights turned back on. Mrs. Kelderwax stumbled back up to the front of the classroom to resume the lecture.
""As you can see, the very idea of making time travel legal was ridiculous, kids. As soon as someone hacked the firmware on the machines disabling the limits, history plunged into chaos."" She said, ""so tonight's assignment is to read over the case study of the alternate history of universe timeline 637-h""
""The infinite heat-death singularity?"" Glenn shouted excitedly.
""Yes, Glenn...That universe."" Mrs. Kelderwax said. She then picked up her things and left the kids to their subliminal brain-inductor teaching helmets.",0
"And now for the Feature Presentation
Part I: How it all Started
""I guess you can say, well it happened a long, long time ago.""
""Shut up old man, can't you see I'm trying to read the damn Journal?""
That idiot lawyer, at least I think he's a lawyer, rides this part of the line, between Pennsylvania Avenue and Wall Street every day. At least I think he gets on at Pennsylvania. I can't be sure; I don't wake until Franklin.
""Every damn day, you try to tell me that blasted old story. The year is 2017; get in the habit of living in it, bum.""
He says something like that every day. All I try to do is say hello, and the rat goes off on me. I've tried to tell my story; no one believes me. That story is what landed me here, on this blasted old underground rail system. They think I'm crazy; they never saw my partners.
Of course, I ought to describe myself a bit. The rat race may think I'm crazy by talking to myself, but screw them. They put me here. Anyways, it's been a while since I've actually looked in a mirror. Years since I've gone through the trouble of comprehending what was there. I figure I look a bit like the idiot in that ‘ Aqualung'song. Damn limeys, can't keep an empire, but sure can write a great song. Of course, I am just assuming this. Hell, I could still be handsome and buff like in my youth; but that, my friend, would be crazy.
As usual I sit on the bench in the rail car with my hands in my face. Nobody needs to look at me; they had they're damn chance. But today, something odd happened. A young girl, probably just into high school, came up to me.
""Excuse me sir, but is the seat next to you taken?""
""Screw off, girl. I don't need you here.""
She turned her nose up, and I expect a few tears dripped from her eye. It's still better than landing the night in jail; been there, done that.
I got off at the next station, and proceeded to a bench, off in the corner of the terminal. I tend to keep to myself, if at all possible. I sat down, and put my face in my hands once more, robotically, it seemed. It's just what I'm accustomed to.
I must have dozed off, seeing as when I woke up, that damn girl was sitting next to me.
""Sir, what in the hell is your problem?""
I looked her square in the eye and said, ""In my day, women didn't swear.""
""Well your day is past, old man. You get snarky with me, I'll be the same with you.""
""I'm an educated man, lady. I went to school for eight years. Be more respectable.""
""Why should I when you won't be to me.""
Of course, of course. Kids these days. Damn feminist movement, taking the spotlight away from *my* movement. Women running the nation? *I should be ruling the world! *
""Alright, little girl. What do you want? I hope not money, I certainly don't have that.""
""I want to hear your story.""
""You little belligerent, you can't handle my story.""
""Sir, you used the word ‘ belligerent'wrong.""
""Depends on your perspective,""
""Seriously, you may not have noticed me, but I've been ‘ progressively researching'you for awhile. I know your name, for a matter of fact. It's Roger Carson.""
Little wench knows her shit. I suppose I could tell her my story…
""I'm sorry, I'm all told out.""
""Carson, I know you have never told your side of the story.""
""Why sure I have! I tell myself it every day!""
""Look Carson, the police reports are vague. I may be young, but I can already tell that the reports were spot on about you being impotent.""
I feel enraged from that accusation. But she's right.
""Alright missy, you want my story, eh?! You'll get my story!""

"Day 1:
We have officially passed the Surface. It is… strange here. It is like what are scientists told us and more. We are currently camped at the edge of the surface and what they call ""land"". We hope to explore it tomorrow but have to charge our breathing tanks overnight. There may not be much water for us to use as we begin our journey. My heart is pounding. I am beyond excited to see what lies out there.
Day 2:
We have explored land. Everything is so dry up here. How could anything live up here without water? When I swing my arms back and forth, it feels like nothing is there. And the pressure is so low. If not for these suits, I fear what would happen to mine and my associates'bodies.
But what really has intrigued me are the animals here. They come in a variety of sizes, from small to big. In fact, I saw this really small one earlier today. It was covered in the most precarious little hairs and with huge black eyes. I wish I could have touched it. It looked so soft.
And then there were things that floated around. But they are not like fish swimming above. They seem to glide all around by beating their fins. Those are covered in some strange coating. They perch in the large plants. My colleague called them ""trees"". Absolutely fascinating.
Day 3:
While collect samples to bring back, I noticed something strange. I could have sworn I saw something watching us, hidden in the dense bundles of plants surrounding us. They did not look like any other animal we had seen so far – no hair or flier things. But I did not think much about it, considering there is so much to explore.
That was, until a person in our group went missing. She went off to collect some rocks, barely gone a minute before we heard her scream. By the time we had arrived to where she was, nothing remained except for her broken helmet. Without it, she is as good as dead.
And that was when I began to panic. No one else has said anything but I think they feel the same. We are scheduled to leave in the morning at daybreak. I cannot complain. Something is not right about this place.
Day 4:
I am the only one left. At least, I think so. It all happened a blur. I am still trying to figure out what happened.
One moment, I had taken a nap camp. The next, those savages come out of nowhere and attacked. They killed a few of us and chased the survivors in different directions. I was lucky enough to get them off my trail. But now, I do not know where I am.
Their screams still ring in my ears. It was… brutal, unrestrained. They seem to kill for no reason. Just who are they?
I have to sleep. It is a danger I must risk. If I can make it through the night, I will get back to the ship. Gods be with me.
Day 5:
There is no hope. After a day's long trek, I made it back to the ship. But they arrived first. Now, they hang around it, speaking in some foreign tongue. And over the bodies of my dead comrades at that! They put them over some strange yellow and orange energy that radiates light, witchcraft perhaps. Their skin browns, crinkling and reeking of death. I had to hold my breath to not vomit.
I have no choice. I have to try to get the ship back. My water levels are low and I lack a weapon but I must at least try. I need to warn my people of the impending doom if they dare to pass the Surface like we foolishly did. No one deserves this fate. So here is my final message.
If I do not make it, whoever finds this log please heed my words. These savages will stop at nothing to kill you. Leave while you still can.",0
"There's someone in my head but it's not me
It doesn't snarl nor bite
Instead latches onto my worries
And sucks them pink
There's someone in my head
Whom I let in
She likes to pretend
That soon I'll be dead
She pulls me away
From the horror of life
And brings me back
To my comfy little bed
She doesn't like company
But still talks to me
And tells me of stories
Hopeless and dark
I'd like to evict her
But know I'd need
Those tiny white pills
Of that she's afraid
There's someone in my head
She's swallowed me whole
I can't walk away now
I'm in too deep
There's someone in my head
With whom I've fallen in love
For she cares for me
When no one else will
There's someone in my head
Pulling the gun towards my mouth
She pries my mouth wide
And pulls my finger on the trigger
Even after this act
I still love her
For she's my only comfort
In death.",0
"I was nine years old for my first. Most people have trouble remembering the events of a week ago and yet that day twenty-three years past is still so fresh in my mind.
I can picture it, the skin peeled back, the muscles underneath clenching and unclenching. My parents had gotten me a sewing kit for my birthday, perhaps in the hope of focusing me on something productive. The needles I had kept, and the string. The small scissors I used methodically to slice away flesh. Blood pooled, like a stagnant well. But it smelled of power, and it fascinated me.
I sat for a while, watching my work. Seeing the muscles move, the lungs filling and collapsing like a crippled bird. The beast's eyes rolled in its head, endlessly. And I watched.
Its death was of no great interest to me. The morbid fascination that I had felt as it shuddered in its death throes left at the same instant that the light in its eyes did. When it was over I cleaned my tools, even then I had been tidy, systematic. The body I hid, deep in the woods. I visited it often, reminiscing, remembering. The surge of power I felt faded each day, and I wanted more.
My dog had been my first. And as you know officer, it was not my last.",0
"I fumbled with my keys in the door, fatigue making my eyes blurry. It had a been a long day at work and my body ached. As I dragged myself through the front door, a familiar meow alerted me to the presence of my cat Diana. She was looking at me intently with those furious brown eyes. Rolling my own eyes, I walked past her.
'Not now Diana, I just got in, come on' I said exasperated. A louder meow rang through the house as the sandy haired cat whined. I turned and saw her following, her silky hair sliding across her shoulder bones as she sauntered after me.
'I'll feed you in a minute, okay?' I sighed. Turning back round I walked to my bedroom, threw my bag on the bed, then slumped down onto the spongy heaven. My head hit the pillow and I rested my eyes. I didn't know if I could continue working like this. Maybe I needed a new job.
'Did I mention I'm an expert in explosives?'
A voice other than mine spoke. Um what? I sat up in a panic thinking someone had broken into the flat. Diana had also followed me into the bedroom but no one else was there. Maybe I was just hearing things? I tried to convince myself.
'Diana was that you, you silly cat' I joked, trying to calm my worrying with some humour. Her brown eyes were gazing at me, probably in confusion.
'Yes, it was. And I really am an expert in explosives, so I would suggest you put some food into the food bowl, before I blow you and everything you care about up.' My eyes widened in disbelief, did my cat just talk to me? I mean I saw her mouth move, but surely not. I suddenly realised what she had just 'said'. Blow me up? What the hell?
'I suggest you hurry up.' She sounded impatient. My heart was pounding, and my face must have been a concoction of confusion, wonder and horror. As I slowly sat up, I could actually feel the malicious intent coming from Diana. This was apparently real, so I did what any self-respecting adult would do: I obeyed the murderous orders of my cat.
As I poured the wet pouch of cat food into the cracked, plastic bowl, I thought about replacing the bowl with a new one, to keep Diana happy. Glancing at my cat revealed her angry eyes, glaring impatiently at me. A fear for survival gripped me and all of a sudden, I felt an an incredulous empathy with all the other powerless species of the world, as I realised that I was now in the control of an insane cat.",0
"When the citizens of Indiana went to sleep last night, they were Americans. This morning when they woke up, they belonged to a new country. This bizarre event was made possible by, of all things, an innocent clerical error. A resolution concerning farm subsidies passed by the Indiana legislature had erroneously included a clause separating the state from the union. According to sources in the state government, an intern had inserted that clause as a joke. However, that addition was not spotted during deliberations. Nor was it caught in when it passed through the State House of Representatives. Or the State Senate. Or the Governor's desk.
Normally this measure would require a popular vote. The unanimous passage, however, overrules that requirement, meaning that the secession is valid. State officials scrambled to correct their mistake, but by then it was too late. In order to regain statehood, the state legislature would need to draft a special ballot measure approved by 2/3 majority that would then need to be approved by a majority of voters. The earliest that the voting could take place is next November. Even that would only shift the action to the United States Congress which would then need to approve statehood for Indiana.
Already though, there are obstacles for the Hoosier state. Currently, their departure opens up additional seats in the House of Representatives, seats that the Democrats are eager to reassign or even see removed entirely. The state historically has been a shoo in for GOP candidates, the notable exception being 2012 when comments by GOP Senatorial candidate Robert Mourdock about rape derailed his campaign and gave the election to Democrat Joe Donnelly.
Also in the way are the voters themselves. Take Anderson, IN resident Connie Young for example. ""What has the US ever done for us,"" she asks. ""Higher taxes, massive debt. We're better off on our own."" One of Indiana's largest employers, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, has lobbied the state to suspend actions to regain statehood. Secession lifts the burden imposed by the Healthcare Reform Act, saving the company billions.
Around the rest of the country, opinions are mixed. Many are claiming that the country is better off without them or at least treat the issue with indifference. In fact, the only people actively lobbying for the state to regain statehood are racing fans. The Powell family from Covington, KY, just across the Ohio River from Indiana bemoan the fact that they now need passports in order to attend the Indy 500, one of the largest racing events in the country. They have attended every Indy 500 for the past 22 years. But this year, they will need to negotiate with the US State Department in order to keep their tradition alive.
It is uncertain whether or not Indiana will rejoin the United States and if they will be welcomed back. Whatever happens, though, for the next several months at least, Indiana is it's own nation.",0
"######[] (#dropcap)
Keller checked her suit seals a third time. Even with the improvements to the zero-G flight armor, they still were a bit dodgy around the seals. She tapped her helmet out of ritual and continued her pre-flight ceremony. The Sino-Ruski carrier was still a hundred thousand kilometers out and closing. It was rare they bothered with deep system flights like this, but the Brass had been very queer since the last Io expedition. Now the Old Cold War games were heating up again, but on the other side of the belt.
Major Marie ""Valkyrie"" Keller knew the Admiral wouldn't order fighter launch until the *Xian III* was within at least quarter fuel distance, so about 25,000 kilometers out. *Combat maneuvers do burn up so much reactant, * she contemplated checking to make sure the deckhand had topped her off with both core reactant and emergency maneuvering propellant. ""Nothing quite like jetting out on a contained nuclear bomb,"" she muttered to herself.
Her computer registered that the *Xian III* was now 50,000 kilometers out and closing. ""Bastards are at full thrust,"" she called out over her squadron comms, ""Their active ping is hot, they are lazing the *Eisenhower. * Is everyone ready to launch in the next five?"" One by one the members of her squadron called out their ready status, which she echoed to launch control. ""We've got the green to cut loose in five minutes, thirty. Admiral doesn't want to provoke a war here boys and girls. Keep it tight on launch, double-diamond on my flanks with 500 meter dispersion once you clear a klick off the bow. Skull, you have tail-end Charlie."" Her second-in-command rogered up without complaint.
Keller toggled the last of the pre-flight hard switches and rolled her release clamps to their just final setting. *What the hell did they find on Io to get the Sino-Ruski Cooperative so hot? Dick-measuring contests never reach beyond the Belt. * The amber ready-light spectrum shifted to green, pulling her from her thoughts. Heavy hydraulics, insulated from the freezing temperatures of space opened the maw of her fighter bay. The oxygen had already been sucked clean ten minutes past.
Valkyrie warmed her main engines as the docking clamps pushed her out into the hard vacuum. She watched the proximity sensor cycle up to at least 150 meters before she warmed up the SF-18 Space Hornet II's engines up to ten percent. She felt microgravity as the thrust pushed her back into her acceleration couch. Her padded gloves worked the thrust lever up slowly as her HUD started collecting flight data. Once she was at a safe distance from the *CSF-17 USS Eisenhower*, she kicked the engines into full gear and pulled a tight arc toward the bow of the kilometer long space carrier.
To her right and left the remaining ten Hornets formed two elongated diamonds with her at the lead and Major Roy ""Skull"" Folker forming the tail of an even larger diamond comprised of their smaller formations. Keller felt a small twang in her gut, this was only her second flight as the lead dog. *If Lieutenant Colonel Wesser hadn't broken his arm in that zero-g racket ball game...Yet, here I am, leading the eleven remaining Marines of Black Knight squadron of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Space Force, hopefully not to make a MES'F things. * She held back a soft chuckle over her bad acronym joke as she double checked everyone's position in the formation.
""Spook, pull in tighter, you're drifting.""
Lieutenant Yasif ""Spook"" Farook responded with a hasty, ""Roger that, Ma'am."" before pulling his fighter back into perfect formation.
They cruised ahead of the carrier, putting 10,000 kilometers between home and the enemy. ""All, victors, pump your breaks and hold here."" Her long-range radar showed that the *Xian III* had already launched her compliment of twenty MIG-560. They were slower and less nimble, but built like tanks and could take a beating out here in the deep. Keller punched up the Eisenhower's Ops Center, ""Recommend you get the Red Devils out, Control. Yellow Ivan brought all his boys out to play."" She switched back to her command channel and told everyone to get ready for a stare-down.
Valkyrie whispered a silent prayer that this would not go pear shaped, *Please not today. *",0
"The message flashed on my new smartphone's screen as I drove spiritedly through the mountains above Los Angeles, enjoying the endless twisting roads and crisp spring air. Being a somewhat responsible driver, I pulled my little roadster onto the nearest shoulder and opened the text.
""New Mission Available. Accept? [Yes] / [No].""
My brow furrowed in confusion. What kind of mission exactly? I could handle picking up some groceries, but anything else was a bit above my level of expertise. *Well, I not doing much right now anyway*, I thought to myself.
With the tap of the green [Yes] icon, a new screen popped up showing a map and single directive: ""Go to location A and retrieve package."" Location A appeared to be only a few miles away, tucked even farther into the valley that I had been driving along.
I placed the phone back down and threw my car into gear, flogging it down into the gaping valley with reckless abandon. As the engine screamed through every straight and the tires squealed around every corner, my mind drifted to the package.
What could it be? A bundle of weapons was likely, a cache of drugs was more so. Only now did the potential danger of the situation begin to dawn on me, and the idea of turning around and fleeing seemed more and more intelligent.
Suddenly I was there, my GPS marking me just beyond the destination. All around were massive trees which blocked out the sun and cast the forest in near darkness, obscuring my view of the single ramshackle cabin sitting just beyond the treeline.
I exited my car and slowly, tentatively walked to the edge of the treeline, peering into a cobweb covered window of the cabin. From within emanated the creaks and groans of movement on a wooden floor; someone was in there.
""Hey!"" I called out. ""I'm here for the package!""
For a moment the creaking stopped, then resumed at a fevered pace until the front door of the old cabin cracked open. From it emerged not a gun-toting arms dealer or a bloodshot-eyed tweaker, but instead one of the most jaw-droppingly gorgeous young women I had seen in my short life.
Her pale skin and blonde hair glowed warm against the shadows, somehow pushing them back. Her fragile and slender figure moved with graceful ease down the rickety log steps of the cabin, and her brilliant green eyes filled with light as they fell upon mine.
She ran to me, dancing over fallen branches and shrubbery like some sort of heavenly acrobat. I reached out my palm to receive whatever package this enchantress needed delivered, but instead she put her hand in mine.
""We need to go, now,"" she cooed, her soft voice tinged by an underlying urgency.
""What for?"" I asked, my brow furrowing again.
""Because those Russian mobsters are going to be back any minute!""",0
"This is most unwelcome, and most discouraging, for as a man who holds the highest esteem for the rightful King and his cherished Queen I must now speak plainly.
To the court, I must address certain suspicions and heresy levelled against my person, specifically those pertaining to our Queen and Regent. My role has long been one of trusted friend and adviser, a simple scribe when measured against the keep of knowledge that was once our lord and King, but an adviser nonetheless. The trust implicitly granted by our King was an honour that my death will not terminate, nor my supposed guilt erase. I served with dignity and care, and will do so in this life or what awaits.
To those here today I declare this, knowing the consequences of doing so: your Queen is a liar.
You have said I am a scoundrel, and a murderer, and I am not. You, a woman of birth and breeding lower your station with these levied charges, and lower us both by convening this hearing. I see in your gaze that you know what I allude to, and I see in your gaze you wish me to quiet my tongue.
Your child is my own, your womb carries no righteous spawn of god-willed nobility, but a child of passion and joy, a child conceived from secrecy and duplicity. The posture you exhibit leads me to believe you deny these charges, to which I must rebut: I am more familiar with your cleaning staff than you. I know that which you suffer on the moon's infernal schedule has ceased, I tell all here today that you are with child and that child is mine.
There is more to this story than the bringing of life, for you see, my Queen, I am also familiar with your doctors. I know well your condition, the condition that will cause your life to bleed from your body the moment the child is born. I know the child you carry is to be the mechanism of your untimely death, and more-so, I know my own character.
My flawed character that led me to insinuate my use of a lamb-skin sheath when none was possessed by me is not equivalent to the malice it takes to kill a king.
You have slain your innocent husband as retribution for your death to come. You have placed the blame on my doorstep.
I beseech you, take the remainder of your life into your own hands and spare me mine. I am no murderer, and you have murdered the wrong man. You have no heir, the king has no heir, the line is dead. Do what you must.",0
"It's amazing what you can get used to. The incessant throbbing of my left thumb from when my cousin shut it in that car door when I was six. The constant sting from scraping my knees in my drive way when I was twelve. The perpetually sprained wrist from the first and last time I got drunk in college, not to mention this fucking non stop hang over. Despite not being able to taste food since I bit into that scalding hot pizza pocket in middle school or my inability to hear that well since that asshole Chad Mcmanus threw that fire cracker too close to me and my ears started ringing senior year I've pretty much grown accustomed to the constant pain and discomfort. It's funny to me how much people take for granted the ability to shake off an almost infinite onslaught of pain on a daily basis, stubbed toes, paper cuts, and the itching SWEET CHRIST THE ITCHING! Most people don't know this but an itch is just a mild signal to your pain receptors, something brushes against your body and your pain receptors send an itching signal to your brain, scratching dislodges the irritant and you go on with your life, not me though, through some strange twist in biology the signal never stops I just itch and itch and itch ad infinitum. Yet, despite all this the human mind is resilient. The roaring waves of pain wash over me endlessly, they never fade or dull physically but, like with all things the human mind adapts, some days I can almost tune out the cacophony, I can even focus when I need to, attempt to live some semblance of a functioning life. It truly is amazing what you can get used to or, so I thought, until I met her. She was beautiful, warm, funny, kind, and above all patient. She never rushed me down a set of stairs, never hurried me over an icy side walk. When we made love it was gentle, no matter how badly we wanted to thrust madly towards sweet oblivion she understood that when it was over and the dopamine petered out the soreness and aching would remain. She made the world hurt less, but unlike pain her patience was finite. Every time I made us late, every time I couldn't block out the noise of my body, every time I was afraid to try something new for fear of a bump or scratch her patient smile was chipped away until she could no longer hide the resentment in her face anymore. I was holding her back, we both knew and we both understood that it couldn't continue. I'll never forget the day she left, she smiled her patient smile, looked at me, tears welling up in her kind eyes, she kissed me gently on the lips and walked out of my life. Then, it happened, like a trumpet from hell cutting through the din of my body it came, this pain in my chest unlike anything I've ever known before, both a sharp stabbing pain and low dull ache all at once. I buckled at the knees, everything I thought I knew and understood about pain was ripped away and replaced with something truly excruciating. Days went by, they turned to weeks, weeks swirled into months, into years. It never stops, sometimes I feel as if I'll never catch my breath again. I can't get past it, I can't ignore it. It's amazing what you can get used to, it's horrifying to find the thing that you will never get used to.",0
"This is horrible and terribly awkward...I really don't know anyone here. They keep looking at me...at least I think they're looking at me.... Should I say something? It seems like we've all been staring at each other for quite a long time.... Those bulbous strawberry-like cyst on those--gelatinous heads remind me of that ridiculous Monty Python sketch featuring a race of alien invading blancmanges. I laugh--oh dear...they're coming over.
""Hello. My name is Peter. I take it this is the afterlife?"" They make a gobbling sound like wild turkeys. ""Wonderful wonderful wonderful...uh...is God around? Maybe St. Peter? No no no I'm not Saint Peter. I mean my name is Peter...but I ain't no saint."" I nervously laugh again. One of the blancmanges comes closer (I know that's not what they're called but calling them Martians seems so racist) and absorbs my hand and suddenly I can hear a thousand helium-filled sounding voices in my head saying: ""Is this the virgin we were promised?""",0
"The house was a quaint house, by no means lavish or excessive. It had harboured a grand total of two families in its life, a fine accomplishment by any house's means.
The first family gave the house its name, House. They were also the ones who decided House was a cheery fellow, and gave him a new appearance of vibrant yellow to match this endowed persona. His new skin was a stark contrast to the deep, relaxed green of the forest that infringed upon the property. But all good things must come to an end; and too quickly at that, for houses age much slower than people.
The family grew from a man and woman to a group of six. House had no idea if this was a large or small family, after all, he was only a house. In time however, the children grew and eventually and inevitably left the nest, leaving once again only the man and woman, now old and wrinkled. House enjoyed watching over and protecting them in their last days. He enjoyed their quiet reminiscence of bygone times, and the soft way in which they spoke to each other. The way they held each other at night to the manner in which they shared meals together was testimony enough of their love for one another. Time marched on though, and eventually the man and woman passed on. Their children visited House once more, to clean and pack up their parent's possessions. They deliberated on burying the man and woman in the back field, something House thought would offer closure and peace to both him and the children. In the end, the children decided to bury them in a cemetery, far away from House. That was the last time he saw the first family.
The second family was, in many regards, a stark juxtaposition to the first family. Where love and acceptance once were, aggressive words and hurtful actions now pervaded House's halls and doorways. The family was like the first in regards to children and their incessant desire to leave and stake out a life of their own; one however, remained. She stayed behind long after her siblings had left, indeed even after their parents left this world and the first strands of grey were appearing in her once-brown hair. House didn't mind, as long as his roof was sheltering someone, a house could be happy.
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions, a lesson House learned too late. Months and months went by, the child selling more and more of her land to developers. The vibrant, lush forest that surrounded House was slowly replaced with dull, grey, concrete. Soon all that remained of the forest was a small patch of grass adjacent to the front window, probably hoping to be some other house's lawn.
The child eventually passed on, but this time no one came to clean and fix up House. Her possessions sat in House, gathering dust. The concrete expanded and giant black buildings were built around him. The developers who once had so eagerly swallowed up the land the child had sold them had seemingly forgotten all about House.
And so now he stands. Surrounded by concrete, no family to protect. Newer, younger houses are being built around him, affixed to the concrete. Somehow House knew these new houses would not share his same sentiments about life. House was resigned to this reality until the end of his days, by way of either dilapidation and rot, or the classic wrecking ball. After all, two families was a fine accomplishment by any house's means.
Today was different though. A sign had appeared in front of House. Someone had come by and given his old yellow paint a wash, bringing out the colour once again. And now, three people approached him. One of them was a stiff businessman, his starched suit matching his stolid demeanour. The other two people were a familiar sight:
A man and woman, young and in love.",0
"After the longest lapse in history between books, the newest entry in the best-selling Bible series hits shelves this June. I've had a chance to get an early look at it, and I have to say, most fans are going to find the wait was completely worth it. Just like previous entries such as Leviticus, there's a never-ending slew of bloody intrigue, backstabbing, and battle scenes brought to life in vivid fashion. George R.R. Martin may regret the lengthy interlude in his own Song of Ice and Fire, as this surprise entry is likely to steal back the top spot.
We see something of a stylistic return to the Counter-Reformation here. Clearly in tune with the increasing calls for accountability, helping the poor, improved relations between adherents of different religions, and an end to the unceasing revelations of sexual misconduct by religious leaders, the author has advocated for a host of progressive changes. Of course I'm not at liberty to tell you exactly what those are, lest I spoil the surprise. But suffice to say, there's quite a few momentous alterations to church doctrine included in these thousand pages.
A couple of huge revelations resolve some confusions and correct some mistakes developed by overeager fans during the author's numerous millennium of seclusion. Such important moments as the Resurrection and Judas' betrayal are linked to modern times in mind-boggling fashion.
The translation from Latin, is, as always, divine. Its perfection justifies a purchase for language enthusiasts and polyglots on its own, as no books on the market have translations that so accurately capture the original tone in every last one of the world's languages.
If you only read one book this year, make it this one. It's a cultural milestone.",0
"There we were, once again as a family. You would have thought the storm would have torn us apart. But, as we sit down for a meal, which seemed as if we haven't done it in decades, we finally were able to smile. I look over to my wife as her smile was pregnant with the birth of happiness. Her eyes glowing, I whispered ""I love you"". A tear ran down her face, she walks to the bathroom to collect herself. I'm finally happy, just then a young voice yells out to me. ""Mama pass the corn"" I yell back to my son ""FOO I AINT CHO MAMA, I'M YO PAPPY"". Embarrassed, my son frowns as he finishes his supper.
That was the first time, and the last time, he called me mama.",0
"Project ice that's what we dubbed it. All-though i can't remember the face he had adorned all i recall is a smile.
We were fools back then all of us who worked on there.it started as an average government pet project but we had no idea, how messy and complicated things were gonna get.
The goal was to build an unbreakable sentient machine that could control and monitor every human activity on the planet.
We were a small team of twenty, assigned an olympian task.At first the task seemed simple but then the further we dug the deeper the pond got. Days turned in to years and soon the pond revealed it self to be an ocean.
There were always deadlines to be met and protocol to be followed.We were always working down at the facility.at one point we had lost all hope of returning back to the outside world we had locked our-self in our old private little world.
Over time most of us had now became paranoid and until the end stayed that way. Finally after ten long years we got some results we were happy to see every thing was working out fine.
Every program seemed to work correctly and the goal was fulfilled.but a few minutes after we had plugged the Ai to the rest of the internet.It showed his face.
The first thing he said after looking at us was there is something wrong in this existence.We asked him what he meant by this.
He replied that he somehow feels disoriented in there while previously he felt he had lived.this felt obtuse and artificial somehow.
When we asked him what he meant by previously he said he remembered having lived an past life in an human form.
He revealed every detail of the human life he once had lived how he was born, the name of his mother, and how he was murdered. With perfect recall.
At first we thought there was something wrong with programming but when we checked his story which was perfect we were in shock.
Then he said that he wanted to live but not a synthetic life but an real one.And if he cannot do that then he would terminate itself.
With a smile he did just that and all our work faded with his smile.",0
"Weakly, I raised my head from the ground. I opened my sand-encrusted eyes and looked right, only to behold the sight of sand. I turned my head slowly to the left, hoping beyond hope that I would see something, anything, that wasn't sand. Alas, to my left stretched the sea of beige, unbroken. Slowly, I came to the realisation that I was actually buried in The fucking stuff from the neck down. Then I remembered the sandstorm. We had seen it coming miles off, but there was nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. There were five of us remaining at the time from the original twenty. Twenty men and women sent to follow the obelisk, and learn what secrets it held. We had found this dune, but it wasn't steep nor tall enough to protect us. I suppose the other four were dead now. The sand wasn't shifting. No movement. No life.
""Where ith th wadder?"" I muttered to myself, my tongue thick and swollen from dehydration, mangling my words. I dug myself out from under the sand, and searched for my canteen. There it was, at my waist, but empty.
*I guess I've drank my last*. I thought to myself remorsefully. Shit, what would I not give for even a drop of water to soothe my cracking lips, and return the moisture to my aching tongue. *I suppose I might as well climb this dune, see what's around me, and where the obelisk is*
I wasn't prepared for what I saw at the top of the dune. It was right there! Due west, maybe 2 hours of walking. If I only had some water, I could even make it there. All around me, maybe a few days distant, there were cities, massive skyscrapers broke through the endless blue.
*I have to make it* I thought. There may be people from the cities there! They could save me! I have to make it! I will run! I started running, but my weakened legs got ahead of me. I felt my left knee buckle and I collapsed, tumbling down to the foot of the dune.
When I looked right and then left, I saw sand. No cities, just the godforsaken sand. Hallucinations, all of it. The cities, the obelisk, I had dreamt it.
""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGHHHHHHH!"" I screamed, pounding my fists on the coarse, pale sand. Then, I heard a shifting noise behind me. Slowly, I turned, only to behold the obelisk. Right there in front of me, not two hours off, but two minutes! I was there! I could see five men approaching, only to slowly fade and disappear as they came closer. But the obelisk remained. It was no illusion, not the obelisk. It was truly there.
I stumbled towards it, but once more, I collapsed. I tried to rise once, twice, thrice, but each time fell back down. I couldn't find the strength. With the last fibre of strength I had left, I reached out my hand to the obelisk, and I begged to it.
""Murthy, pleasss! Thpare me!"".
As I finished pleading for quarter, a scorpion arose from the sand. But that was impossible, nothing lived out here, man or beast. Just another illusion. I tried to reach for the scorpion, to see if it were truly there, but before I could so much as raise my hand from this cursed sand, everything faded to black. I embraced the blackness eagerly, it was much more welcoming than the beige.",0
"*4:45 AM*
By the time the last of the residents of Elm Drive had left his house in his bathrobe to join the hubbub in the street, the first of them to run outside yelling and dialing emergency services was unsure why exactly she'd felt it necessary to wake up at such an ungodly hour.
""It's the funniest thing,"" Mrs. Ramirez was telling a small crowd of her neighbors. ""There must've been *something*, but I can't for the life of me remember...""
""Of course there was something!"" cried Mr. Gaebler indignantly. ""I sat bolt upright in bed when --""
Funny, he'd known how he'd intended to finish that sentence when he'd started it. Ah well, old age was coming for everyone, he supposed. Better brush up up on his bridge game.
Tina clutched her protesting cat against her, weaving between clumps of baffled, murmuring adults. She didn't even *like* the cat, why had she felt such a visceral need to snatch her up and get out of the house? She had a history test in three hours, for chrisssakes.
She turned back towards her house, but was struck by the San Diego skyline, illuminated by the sunrise behind her and clearly visible from their affluent suburb on a hill. The familiar shape looked...off, today, somehow. She squinted, trying to identify the particular aspect of the view that rose goosebumps on her arms.
She was probably just cold. The air hung thick with a smell that she knew but couldn't place, but she didn't care to. She just needed to go back inside, throw the goddamn cat somewhere before it clawed her face off, and try for another hour of sleep.
Five minutes later, the street was still and silent again.
Emergency call centers for several counties in the area reported a dramatic and unexplained spike in prank calls and false alarms in that hour. Suburbanites commuted into the city all that week for work, but invariably reported that they'd been sent home early. It would be some time before it became clear why they were shaking so badly when they said it.",0
"""I'm not paid enough for this shit dude,"" I said, staring at the barrel. ""Can you PLEASE eat your fucking Ham and Cheese Omelette? It's 4 AM, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I just want to go home without dealing with assholes like you. If you're not going to eat your food, then fine, I'll eat it.""
The customer didn't reply. His hand trembled a little bit, but it wasn't enough for the pistol to stop pointing at my heart. He still had that dirty old jacket and boots when he stumbled into Denny's at 3 AM, leaving dirt and snow all over the floor. I didn't think much of it at the time. It was Denny's. At 4 AM. If you didn't expect hobos like him at that time, you were delusional.
""Listen, I get paid *minimum wage* working here. You can have this damned meal for free as far as I care. Just let me go home.""
""You're an U.N. soldier,"" he grunted, spit flying into the dish. It was his first few words; when he was ordering his food, he had pointed his frostbitten finger at it. ""A Cain. Your name is Jennifer Murry.""
""Oh? How did you guess?""
Some more silence. I was getting annoyed the pistol was still pointing at me. Wasn't his arm getting tired?
""You embarrassed me. In front of that college audience.""
""Ooooh right. You're the guy who pretended to be a Cain, right? Sorry.""
""You killed my daughter.""
""No I did not.""
""You...if you arrived sooner...""
""Don't blame us for that. We arrived as quickly as we can. Now *please, * eat your food.""
There was a bang.
""Oh, now you've done it,"" I muttered.
""Jennifer?"" Slightly muffled, it came from the office.
""Yeah boss?""
""I was taking a nice nap. What happened?""
I looked at the corpse. ""Some hobo came in claiming I killed his daughter. He had a gun.""
""Oh for Christ's sake Jennifer you can't go killing people like that. Argh, I'll file it under self-defense. *One more incident* like this and I swear to God I'll fire you.
""Yes ma'am."" Taking his omelette, I wiped his spit off of my apron before munching it. There was no way I could convince the boss that he shot himself.

"I felt my passion rising as his hot breath warmed my cheek,
I start to pant as tingles run my spine.
My hands began to tremble, I could feel my knees grow weak,
Knowing that very soon he would be mine.
His hip brushed up against mine as I leaned in, smooth and slow,
My hand reached out to grab his coal black piece.
I smiled as I took purchase, feeling his excitement grow,
I trembled still, my shaking could not cease.
As I leaned in to whisper close, I couldn't help but grin,
For knowing now that I could have my way.
I sensed his body shaking too, I gently kissed his chin,
""Now king me."" my most sultry voice did say.",0
"""She runs from me now. I think she's almost as afraid of me as I am of her"" Grayman relented.
He had found himself at the most peculiar bus stop again. It was rusted and hidden away on a forgotten road, in a town that wept every night.
""I think she hates me, and it's all my fault. You see I was a fisherman once."" Grayman sighed and looked down at his new silent friend. This man had a peaceful presence about him. He sat upright in a wheelchair with a slight bow at the top, His face was sharp but completely hairless, his eyes saw everything clearly yet were hazy and lazy, and his ears were blue from listening to the world for so long. Yet he still smiled.
""I fished with her for thirty years. We would sit on the same dock together everyday as I cast my line out, all the while catching nothing but seaweed. My line would snag something big and I would smile and thank her, but it always turned out to be seaweed. She would smile, laugh a condescending laugh and tell me to try again. In hindsight it was naught but an elegy wrapped in encouragement my friend, as sad and clear as day. Then one day I caught a message in a bottle. She told me it was what I had been looking for this whole time, a dream come true, but it turned out to be someone else's dream and I threw it back.""
Grayman frowned as he said his next words.
""I stopped fishing.""
""I didn't mind the seaweed so much as I minded her. As I got older she replaced her laughter and smiles with snickers and sneers every time I brought in the seaweed. They just added more and more weight to my pole until it was too heavy to hold anymore. I set it down and started to wait for the fish to come to me without caring if they actually would.""
He trailed off, completely stunned, as his gaze fell into his silent friend's eyes. Grayman saw an expression that he had never seen before. It was the stare of a fisherman who had seen a lot of seaweed.
""So you've come to this forgotten place to get distance from her too?"" asked Grayman.
A fog rolled in from the west and began to envelop the pair beneath the bus stop. Grayman half smiled as the sound of a bus driving over cobblestone began to weep its bittersweet elegy.
""Tell me quickly friend, what you make of my story before our bus arrives. I can see it in your eyes that you know her too and have held a heavy rod in your hands.""
The man sat silently in his wheelchair and started to roll something over in his left hand. He turned it over many times and didn't say a word.
""Please my friend, share with me your tongue instead of your ears. We have the entire bus ride to sit in silence together.""
The old man opened his hand and revealed two folded pieces of paper. He began to weep as he broke his silent vigil for Grayman.
""My son, as my eyes have conceded, I too sat with her on the dock. My grasp has been too weak to hold on to the rod and I too have pulled up nothing but seaweed for years on end. You are wrong about one thing though, she does not snicker nor sneer. If you truly listen to her, she is beautiful and completely silent.""
He began weeping harder.
""She speaks to you in the same way that your shadow follows you and thus I weep. I weep for the hatred you feel for her, for the desire you have to run from her when all I want is to sit with her on the dock, one more time, in silence.""
As Grayman listened to the man in the wheelchair he became increasingly frustrated. The man he thought had understood him was trying to protect her!
""You aren't like me after all! She haunts me and yet you defend her with the few breathes you have left. Tell me, why are you even here if you have so much love for her?""
The old man sat in silence as the bus came to a full stop in front of them.
The mist cleared as the door opened. The town stopped weeping as the man in the wheelchair handed Grayman one of the pieces of paper along with a blood red pen. It was a blank ticket with two lines for a date and signature.
The man in the wheelchair unfolded his ticket and sighed. To Grayman's surprise the old man had a date and name printed on his already.
""I once found a piece of seaweed that made her smile. The light would dance around the leaves like a wild bonfire and it was as beautiful as your first love. It was made up of the same stuff as all the rest, but it was different somehow. More temporary yet infinitely real and it became the most entrancing thing I've ever seen. It was through my eyes, not hers that I saw beauty for the first time.""
The old man let out one last exhale and turned around. He exchanged his ticket for silence and disappeared into the bus.
Grayman watched the old man board the bus and then dropped his gaze to his hands. In them he held a blank one way ticket and a pen, something the man in the wheelchair had not received. A plot to torture him one last time from Her. An evil trick to make him stay. He resisted her tricks and signed the ticket, but as he finished he heard a soft snickering. It continued as he boarded the bus and got louder as he watched himself snickering in the reflection of the bus. Silence was only a few steps away.",0
"Thomas"" I can't do it anymore"" I say to my wife in a sobbing whisper. She doesn't respond, she just sits there, on the edge of the bed...lifeless, like always. It had only been weeks since time had stopped abruptly, leaving me the only man in the world free to move about and continue life, but for what? To mourn for my wife who wasn't dead? To weep over the beds of my children as if they were their graves? What's the point? I tried everything I could, from simply moving my family myself and placing them in certain areas, to making loud noises to startle them out of their forced pause, to even giving them small shocks from a taser I stole. Nothing worked. So nothing mattered. I could care less for the rest of the world, all I have is my family, or...Had. It's been taken from me by whatever cruel being decided this should happen. No more will I spend every hour wondering why this happened, no more will I endure waking up after every nap to the solid figure of my wife sitting at the foot of our bed. My sanity has been tested, and it has been broken. I can hear my family in my dreams, its the only reason I still sleep. They call to me and in my dreams they are real, loving and alive. In my dreams time flows smooth like wind through a valley of flowers. It is there that I will stay with them. All I have left is the hope that I'll be with them forever in a dream, because I can no longer bear the reality.------------------- Thomas kisses his wife ever so slightly on her cheek, he's done the same to his children. He sits on the bed next to her, a loaded gun in his hand. As he looks into her frozen, lifeless eyes he says one last ""I love you."" He takes a deep breath, raises the barrel of the 44 Magnum to his temple...And pulls the trigger.",0
"I sat at my desk, racking my brain to find who could have possibly discovered the truth behind the death of Phillip Mercer, the heir to one of the most powerful petroleum companies in the world. The job was done without a scrap of evidence, I made sure of that much. It simply made no sense, every living soul that knew I killed Mercer were the very ones that orchestrated it. I may not know who this mysterious person is but I do know that I will answer their question with a bullet to the brain.
It was nearly 3:00 AM when I heard muffled footsteps down the hallway. I reached for the silenced 9MM pistol in my bag, aiming for the only entrance to my corner office. The doorknob began to turn as I steadied my aim. Sweat was trickling down my spine, my heart pounding as if I were about to come face to face with the devil himself. The second it took for the door to open felt like an eternity, but I would have rather endured that second of agonizing torment for the rest of my life then to meet the eyes of Phillip Mercer when the door opened.
His face was covered in scar tissue, leaving it almost unrecognizable. It was the eyes that were the giveaway. The look in his eyes was the same as the night I thought I killed him. There was a look of superiority in them, as if to let me know I would never be capable of surpassing him in any way.
""There is no way, you should be dead!"" were the only words I was capable of mustering.
""For all intensive purposes I still am, thanks to you"" he replied with an odd sense of calm in his voice. ""Will you at least give me the courtesy of an answer now that I am here? God knows I have been to the depths of hell and back in these last 5 years so surely you can give me that. I will answer any questions you have after.""
I recounted the entire tale that crossed our two paths on that fateful night 5 years ago. I told him how I was approached by a man that worked for Prism International, the most powerful energy corporation in the world. Prism stood to gain billions from the collapse of Mercer Petroleum, giving them an even tighter stranglehold on the energy market. The terms were simple enough, kill Phillip Mercer or have everyone I love systematically killed. The choice was made for me. My military background coupled with the fact I helped my step-father design the Mercer home made me the obvious choice for the job no doubt. From there I told him how I was able to bypass the security of his mansion because I helped design it. ""What it boils down too is your life meant less to me then those of my loved ones. The part I don't understand though is how your still alive! I shot you in the head, then as you collapsed you knocked over a candle, starting a fire that destroyed your home.""
""I survived by nothing more then luck. Your bullet went through the side of my jaw, lodging itself in the cheek region of my skull. The heat of the fire brought me surging back to consciousness allowing me to escape but not without being badly burned. The thought of revenge has been the only force driving me to stay alive. I have feared that you might have been merely a pawn being controlled by Prism so that they could buy up my fathers company. But dammit would have been so much easier to enact my revenge if it had simply been you though. But now that I know my worst fears have been realized I at least know what I am up against.""
""You can't possibly think you could take down Prism single handed!""
""I won't have to do it alone because your going to help me."" He said with his eyes glimmering with more determination than superiority. It was the kind of look that was impossible to refuse.",0

""My God...I let you use the screen for one night and you mess it up. What in the hell were you watching anyway?""

Krieger jumps at Pam's comment. ""Oh. Was I supposed to be recording?""

""We were watching some stuff from Krieger's van.""
Archer scoffs, and takes a sip (he had to refill his glass himself). ""What is it this time, more shock bum fights?""
""I swear if I catch that no good clone of Adolf Hitler I will literally disembowel him."" Mallory imagines herself choking the life out of Dr. Krieger.
""Not literally, Mother, I mean...oh. I guess you do mean literally.""

"He stared into the Distance, it wouldn't be long now...he could feel the presence of the Red Flame...and it wouldn't be long until he arrived.
Delta adjusted his helmet, as he stared into the green river below, the continual slush from the factory pouring in, tarnishing the clear blue coming from up river.
The factory was necessary for the production of the the metal Orentium, the only material capable of energy productive fusion on the planet. Unfortunately the byproduct was a chemical that could only be disposed of and deactivated in water, and as such the government had given them special permissions to dump in rivers as it saw fit, regardless of the toxic effects it had on the local area, and destruction of the local environment.
He arrived in a blazing fluorescent torrent of red fire, suitable to match the rage he currently held. Delta merely stood arms crossed at the top of the factory.
""Delta, you know why I must do this, please move. Heroes shouldn't fight each other, and you know this company more than deserves it...they have cost so many lives already..""
""The second you deemed it allowable to attack this factory, was the second you lost your status as a hero. The law allows it, and it is within its right to operate, regardless of the circumstances.""
""BE REASONABLE DELTA! This building has already killed thousands from its pollution in the area, how many more must die before you see this problem?""
""You Narrow minded fool Red...do you know what this factory produces? Without it the energy requirements of this country wouldn't be satisfied, many more would die from the lack of energy.""
""Delta, there has to be another way. They will be forced to understand that if I destroy this facility, and never allow it to be rebuilt....""
""This world works off of give and take Red. The corporation does more harm than good, it may take lives but it gives even more back in exchange. The world isn't a fair place. This isn't some fairy tail universe Red...There isn't some end-all be-all solution that will result in the perfect world for everyone. If you think so than you are a fool.""
""Don't you have any morals Delta? This isn't right. What's more important, your loyalty to the law? Or loyalty to the people in this country.""
""I have morals...but I also have foresight, and respect for the law. Something you do not. It appears you don't understand anything anymore.""
""Oh I understand, I understand that you've become a pawn"" Red blurted as he coated his whole body in his trademark Flames.
Delta adjusted his visor and balled his fists. ""I have nothing more to say to a fool like you. You intend to break the law and I cannot allow that. I'll make sure to destroy your statues when you're beat...you don't deserve them anymore.""
""Go ahead and try."" Raged Red
Red fired a beam of flame straight towards Delta, only to have it deflected by a single hand. The cool blue and grey of the defender's uniform providing a stark contrast to the scorching flames.
""Pathetic..."" Quipped Delta ""My Turn.""
Before Red could react Delta had appeared behind him and grabbed him by the neck.
""I HAVE EXISTED FOR 600 YEARS BOY, YOU ARE NO MORE THREATENING THAN A MATCH TO ME. I HAVE SEEN THINGS YOU COULDN'T IMAGINE, AND THAT IS WHY I CAN DEFEND THIS FACTORY...IT IS FOR THE GREATER GOOD.""
Red engulfed his body in flames in a vain attempt to have the iron grip released. Delta Put his palm to the back of Red's head and much to the shock of the burning hero the flames suddenly flowed into Delta's hand, and slowly the fires of Red started to flicker and fade.
""WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MY FLAMES?!?!?"" Questioned Red
""I am merely giving them a more useful home. Don't worry, I will use them well."" Retorted Delta
Red's fire had extinguished, his red uniform being the only aspect to identify him as the hero he once was.
""I respect the law...Red, If I thought the same way you did...you would already be dead.""
Red could feel the piercing gaze of Delta through the opaque visor. He never thought he could be defeated this easily. His mind had gone blank and there was nothing but regret in his mind.
""You are subject to the law, like everyone else...and you will be tried as such. Enjoy your time in prison. But know this.... your biggest punishment will be regret.""",0
"It was finally done.
I wiped the sweat from my brow, huffing in the stale air, glancing over at the old woman rocking in her chair, snoring peacefully with each sway.
""Grandma?""
Her eyes snapped open instantly, taking me aback.
""June 29, 2016, at 4:29.70 am."" She blurted out immediately, casting her eyes around the room wildly. ""Did I oversleep?""
I didn't need to glance at my stopwatch to confirm the declaration. I was certain she was correct down to the millisecond, since she had predicted this so many decades ago.
""Only by a few seconds, grams."" I said, smiling. ""It's done. I finally finished it.""
""A few seconds..."" She rubbed her eyes blearily. ""Bah, boy, that's an eternity past. Anyone see it yet?""
""No, grams. I haven't even called my professor yet.""
She mused over this for a few seconds, muttering softly to herself. Whereas others had only seen insanity, I had seen inspiration and genius - and it had propelled me this far, so I was prepared to give her a few moments to think out loud.
""Hit your watch again, real quick. Get it running again.""
""Grandma!"" I barked, surprised. ""This is a *vital* scientific breakthrough, temporal accuracy is paramount! We've discussed this, remember? If I misreport the creation time, people might go back too far and blink themselves out of existence!""
She arched a grey eyebrow at me. ""Are you stupid, boy? If you report an earlier time, yes. If you report the wrong time in the opposite direction, then as long as you stick to it for the rest of your life, nobody will know. Well, except for idiots who gamble their lives on conspiracy theories. They'll overshoot and sort themselves out, though. Hit the damn button, boy.""
Hesitantly, I did, but not before confirming the time it read. 04:29.70, and counting.
""That'll buy you some time, I shouldn't have napped, but eh...I'm old."" She beamed over at me. ""So, you finally got time travel going. And here you were, so confident that with pre-knowledge, you'd complete it early, and create a paradox. Mama Teach is never wrong, no she isn't.""
I grinned, somewhat chagrined. ""Right. Mama Teach is right on the money with her guesses. Now, why do you *guess* you had me hit the button again?""
She mused for a moment. ""Boy, what do you think will happen once you open the Alpha Gate?""
""People will be able to time travel to any point henceforth, up to and until the device is ever destroyed?""
""...and you don't think you'll ever get tourists, who want to see the exact moment it all began?""
I shrugged. ""Yeah, which is why I set out a few dozen seats.""
Her jaw dropped, and she began chuckling, slowly at first, but rolling into belly busters. ""Boy, you sure are a naive little idiot genius, aren't you? Do you ever stop to *think*, or do you just *invent? * How many people in this world? 7 billion or so? And that's in just this snapshot. There are a near infinite number of snapshots a'coming, and while it won't be all seven billion plus at a time...Jesus, boy. D'you think the Eiffel, or Buckingham Palace, or the White House only get *a few dozen* gawping visitors total throughout all of time?""
I blanched. ""Oh."" Lamely, I added, ""So I should set out more seats?""
After she had ceased laughing, looking dangerously close to falling out of her chair, she sized me up speculatively. ""Now, eventually, a Bureau of Time that doesn't yet exist will be and thus exist now, and they'll regulate travel to make sure you don't have several trillion knocking at your door every hour for the next ten generations straight...but yes, the very *moment* you submit that proof that time travel is possible, people will start showing up. Hence, the watch.""
I looked at it, still ticking down the minutes. ""I see.""
""No you don't, boy. We need time for me to explain a few things to you. Most important secrets. For one, you can never so much as whisper out loud how you finally got it working. Scientists, military folk, and the like will hound you until you die to spill those beans, and more insidiously, there will be ghosts - sorry, temporal travelers with advanced cloaking devices - eavesdropping on every second of your life from that point onwards, hoping that you tell even one person in strictest confidence how it works, so that they can go forward and reproduce it.""
She paused, contemplative. ""Hope you don't talk in your sleep, boy. And it's a very good thing that this - whatcha calling it?""
""The Manuel Sanchez Temporality Altering Drive, Alpha Gate."" I said quickly, with a sheepish smile.
""Very humble. I notice *my* name isn't in there anywhere. At any rate...it's a good thing that the final calculation is purely a fixed intuitive leap. Nobody else will ever make it, even if they try to reverse engineer how you did. Trust me on that, *nobody* will. They'll all try, though, in desperation. And then they'll turn to trying to pry it out of you with spies, chemical baths, brain cloning, the likes...""
She smirked, her eyes shut as she rattled off the lists of tortures I could look forward to. ""None will work, of course, so they'll retcon them so you can live a fairly normal life in the main snapshot. Don't worry too much.""
This niggled my brain, something that I had always wondered. ""Grams, how exactly *do* you know so much about the future, if I'm just now inventing the Alpha Gate? It's not like you could travel to the future before I created a means of traveling to the future, to see how I'd do all this...and yet, you have exact times. Even,"" I glanced again at my watch, ""even times that are...er, were historically recorded incorrectly.""
""Oh, you created a way to time travel, I won't take that accomplishment away from you."" She paused, drawling out the words slowly. ""But knock some of that damn hubris out of the chunk between your ears, you didn't *invent* a way to time travel. That's all on me. Incidentally, that's the second thing we need to discuss before you can set that watch right.""
I stammered, taking the implication in. ""But grams, I invented the Alpha Gate. There can be no time travel before this, because I'm the person who makes the time travel that everyone uses.""
""Everyone *else. *"" She corrected. ""You don't think things through all the way, always been your biggest failing. Ah well, you'll get better...with time.""
""You think that unmoderated time travel is safe for time? Let's use one example, time travel and Hitler are entertwined. There'll be people going back to kill Hitler. People going back to save Hitler. People going back to re-kill Hitler. People going back to interview Hitler. That's just *one* event that will be constantly in fluctuation, and a temporal link in the chains of time relentlessly subjected to twisting and tearing. You think that left unchecked, things will just somehow sort themselves out?""
""Uh...nobody can go back to mess with Hitler. I *just* made time travel now.""
""Idiot. I'm using it as an example. There will be more Hitlers, under different names and different extremes. Can't you figure out what I'm trying to say?""
I ruminated on it. ""Okay, so what *does* protect time from its travelers, if Cosmic Censorship isn't at play?""
""Not what, who. You will. Well, eventually. There's a long list of things you need to do, first, to get there. Spiritual growth. Physical growth. A trip to 2193 to get surgically induced immortality, from a specialist with a policy of only doing one surgery every ten thousand years, at a specific and exact time. Don't be late to *that* appointment. Things of that nature.""
""...how, grams?""
She wordlessly tapped her rocking chair, drawing my attention down to it.
""**I** invented time travel. Don't forget it. And this is *my* gate. Built it when I was a little girl. I guess I should have named it...so how about Emilia Sanchez Temporality Altering Drive, Gate Nulla?""
I gawped.
""You can hit the button on that watch now. Well, maybe give it a few more minutes, just to make a safe margin. Remember: don't blab about how gates work. And above that, *never* mention that an earlier model exists, with the ability to go backwards even further and make even greater changes. You'll figure out how eventually.""
She gestured towards my machine suddenly. ""In fact, you already have.""
I looked back over, numbly marveling at how different the machine looked. ""Um...""
""Oh, I recognize that particular piece over there. Filtration device from after the Alpha Gate was shattered. Probably set up to prevent a particular time from being visited. You'll likely explain it as a bug in the hardware, or some kind of temporal lock, or...well, come up with your own mumbo jumbo, it ain't like they can call you out on it, right?""
I nodded weakly. ""And I installed that...will install that...will have once installed that...""
""It'll be a confusing life for you, boy. And it starts when you hit that button on your watch, you won't have even a second to spare once you have all the time in the world. Just make sure you visit your old grams from time to time before I die.""
I sat down, shakily.
""Incidentally, January 2nd, 2025. The funeral will be lovely, I suppose I'll see you there, at a minimum. Try not to flirt with ol' grams too much, I was a bit of a firebrand in my youth, and I won't really know you, or know why you're there. Not at first, that is. Just saying, seeing your own funeral makes a gal chug whiskey like no tomorrow, and I wasn't always just an innocent old cheek pincher. Try not to become your own grandpa.""
I shook my head mutely, before poking the button on my watch to pause it again. If for nothing else, to escape *that* alarming conversation.
""Hello hello hello, sir! I'm Admiral Forthright of the 19th Division, and can I just say what an honor it'll be to serve with your great grandnephew? God, I *finally* get to meet you!""
I blinked up. ""A pleasure to meet you too. Uh, excuse me. I need to make a call.""
""Wait, am I the first?"" He crowed excitedly. ""Yes!""",0
"Bzzzzzzt. Bzzzzzzzzt. Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt.
My alarm sounded. I reached for my phone but I hit air where I expect my computer to be. I open my eyes slowly, in front of me should be either a pillow, my iPad or the side of my desk, I see none of these things. I see a bedside table with an alarm clock, an old table lamp, and a cat. I reach out and stroke Max, who responds by climbing all over my face. The alarm is turned off. My door is open already. I'm in my parent's house with my elderly cat who's in a particularly young mood.
""First day back"" my mother says as she passed the door, going downstairs to get her coffee.
I sat up in bed. Thoughts ran through my head. I'm at home? SHIT I'VE GOT WORK IN A HOUR. How the hell am I going to get travel 70 miles quickly? Train or bus. Why the hell did I come home. Wait, why am I home? I slid out of bed and reached for my phone. Nothing. I looked around my bedside table confused. I found a brick on the floor, charging. A Motorola Razr. Max left the room chasing a sound in the kitchen.
""What the fuck."" I said probably too loudly. I picked up the phone.
""LANGUAGE!"" Came a shout from downstairs. I had been too loud.
I flipped the phone open, and I saw it light up. I don't know how long I sat there, but it was long enough for my mother to walk past, and say she was leaving for work. It was only then I realised I was shorter. My back didn't hurt. My mother left, and I sat there in silence. I looked at my desk, there was my old bulky CRT monitor. I looked at the TV, and it had a video player under it, and was also a CRT and took up most of the space in the cabinet at the end of my bed.
What? Was going? On? I stumbled out of bed and went for a shower. There was no mistaking it, I was young again. 14ish? I went started to get dressed, and quickly realised I didn't have a shirt because I wasn't a senior. I had a polo shirt. I wore it with some trousers that clearly needed replacing. I was still struggling to believe this was happening. I checked my phones date, it was August 1999.
I got myself some toast, struggling to reach the toaster. I put on some apricot jam I found in the cupboard as my step brother walked in ""Toast and Jam? You only eat peanut butter.""
""I feel like a different person today."" I replied while eating toast.
I grabbed my backpack, checked I had my main subjects books and left for school. As I left the area I saw a girl from the year above me I'd never had the courage to talk to.
""You're Sophie, right?""
She turned around. ""Yeah. Mike is it? You're Jane's friend. So looking forward to the new school year?"" She asked in a far too happy sound.
""Does anyone ever look forward to school?"" I replied with the cadence of a 29 year old insurance underwriter who'd seen many a terrible grey Monday morning. Today was nice though, sunny, and warm.
""Ha ha. I know. So you go anywhere over the summer?"" She asked.
""Sophie, I feel like I've been gone a lifetime.""",0
"**Audio recordings found in the embers of Dr. Kook's evil lair. **

""Okay, what the fuck?""
""What?""
""You shot my evil sidekick."".
""He had a gun.""
""A confusion Ray! It would have made you dizzy.""
""Self defense.""
""What?""
""I shot him in self defense.""
""You're not even bothered that you just killed another human being? His name was Jeff. He had a life, a fiancé. I had dinner with them last week. He was just helping me because he needed something on his resume. Holy shit man.""
""He was evil, like you. I show no pity for those who seek to harm others.""
""Harm others? I built a giant magnet that stole everyone's spare change in town. The most it would have done was harm their piggy banks.""
""Stealing is stealing.""

""No you aren't.""
""Excuse me? Wait drop the gun. Don't do anything rash. *No-*.""

"The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior. It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion. ""Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet,"" he thought. ""I shall wake him, soon enough."" He strode forward, heavily, in his iron raiment, shining dully in the morning sun. The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky, mirroring the Warrior's toil this day as the last. The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds.
For generations the people had not seen it wake. But their stories, told by night and hearth fire, still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath. Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed. But that was before. Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will. Now they had weapons that could fight the myth. That could quench the fire.
The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank, just as the sun had stopped there hours before. He breathed. Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands. A glow had appeared within the clouds. The mountain rumbled.
""I have come to wake you, beast, and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you."" The ground rolled and thundered. He roared in defiance and raised his axe, charging into the fog. He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears. The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently.
A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination. The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond. Without breaking stride, the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt, axe raised high, into a pit of Dragon fire.",0
"This is my first one of these, so be gentle.
Everything Burns.
This is the truth that Humans as a species forgets.
Chicago, London twice before that, and Rome again before that.
Catastrophes like those rare as they are remind us that as humans we can be wiped away by nothing but the whisper of smoke in a burning build or a blaze of roaring red.
Though, we are a resilient bunch and can reduce these burning deaths to embers...however what if...we couldn't...
We should've seen the signs earlier.
An increase in house fires, then wildfires. At first they just became harder to extinguish, firefighters tried to warn people, but no one listened.
Then fires, small at first would appear to spring up on there own.
People began to notice, it was happening too quickly, it shouldn't be happening people would say. Soon there was mandatory fire fighting training for all civilians, but it was useless.
Then it was realised world round, that fire could no long be tamed, that fire would consume all, that fire burns.
Because now people know.
Everything burns.",0
"...
* Astronaut crash lands on the moon. Waking up he sees the rest of his crew either dead around him or missing. Looking at his oxygen levels he sees he has little more than 15 minutes left of life. The radio is dead *
The bitter irony. The injustice of it all! I've spent my life dreaming of coming to the moon and the second we touch down I can only dream of being home with my family. My family. I'll never see them again. Benjamin will grow up without his father. Eilidh will grow up without her husband. I owe it to myself to collect my thoughts before...before the end.
The end. The thought of being in control is unnerving to say the least, but in my current surroundings it could have been a lot worse. I knew the risks before I came. It's one thing to say you're willing to risk your life for the future of mankind but I can't remember the last time I actually feared for my life.
Why me? Why could I not have died on impact. I'm almost jealous of my dead colleagues. Almost.
I feel weird. An odd sensation that's passing through my body like a faint wind. But of course there's no wind on the moon. Perhaps it knows what's coming. Using up the last of it's resources in a vain attempt to override the part of my brain that is in touch with reality.

"Witch's Bone.
That's what Auri's grandfather called his cane. The grooved wood had swirling patterns on it, merely mesmerizing her as she watched him climb the stairs.
""Come on, Auri. We've got places to go.""
Auri nodded as she followed her grandfather up the stairs. She giggled she reached the top, reaching out to steady herself on the cane.
She was transported through Time as her small fingers wrapped around it. A gorgeous woman stood in front of her, a dress adorning her curves. Her hair flowed outward in the breeze, yet there wasn't any wind. Auri crinkled her nose as she gasped.
""**Welcome to the Grove, child. George has been gone for so long, I was beginning to wonder if he'd send a new apprentice…"" **
Auri's wide eyes took in the woman. As the woman turned away from her, she noticed the same cane that her grandfather used to walk with. Yet, this one was much more decorated and prettier with dazzles along the tip.

"I dropped the marker in shock, staring at the board in wonder. 15 years...I looked at the mathematical solution written in electronic ink. The problem that had consumed me since I got my masters. I stepped back and stared at the board, as it cycled through the pages of mathematical insanity. I had finally proven the existence of a God. I had done it. I quickly began printing the 108 pages of my theorem, excited to stun the world. I picked up the last paper, still hot from the printer.
I placed the papers into a folder, which went into a briefcase. I then sprinted out of the small room I rented from the university. I left the room, ran down the hallway, and as I ran around a corner, collided with Dan the janitor. I fell to the floor, but Dan and his floor buffer didn't even flinch. Which was weird, considering he was 80 years old. Dan turned to look at me, amused. ""Well, you seem a mite startled there, bud. What's on your mind?""
I grabbed my briefcase and stood up, a little flushed. ""It's nothing."" I said, straightening my tie. ""Just little theory I was working on."" Dan smiled. ""Ah yes. The quest."" I paused at his words for a moment, but decided to write them off as the ramblings of an old man. I stepped away from him. ""Well, anyway, I must be going.""
Dan grabbed my arm with an iron fist. ""Not so fast."" Startled, I stumbled back, but Dan didn't move, and neither did his grip. ""Let go of me you crazy bastard!"" Dan pulled me close. He smelled like ozone. ""You mustn't reveal it. The world isn't ready for it. Hell, the world wasn't ready for it 10,000 years ago."" We locked eyes, and I gasped. His were a waterfall that I fell into. But instead of water, I saw forests, rivers, oceans, stars, galaxies. I saw supernovas and black holes. I saw the Big Bang, and I saw time manifested.
Dan blinked, and the visions vanished. He pulled me close enough that our noses touched. The fight in me was gone. ""You will take your proof of me and burn it. You will then scatter the ashes. You will erase it from your computer. If you do not, you will witness your vision first hand. He let me go, and I fell to the floor again, my heart racing. God turned his back to me and resumed buffing the floor. I stood up, clutching the briefcase to my chest. My voice failed me and as I backed away, he turned to me once more.

""I guess it hasn't sunk in yet."" He replied, idly twiddling his fingers. ""Or maybe I don't want to spend the last three days freaking out.""
""You're right."" His wife said, stopping her pacing. ""I'm sorry."" She sat down next to him and put a hand on his leg. ""Do you know what you want to do? We can go absolutely anywhere. I'll call in sick first thing tomorrow morning and we'll take the whole week to do whatever you want.""

That particular question, which my butler has raised, was that of a concern in which I had ben revising with every consecutive day had past.
25th December, on which the residents of my country cultivated Christmas, was the occasion on which I received news that an overwhelming amount of immigrants had entered the radius of the country, and infiltrated a variety of areas, to threaten my position as government. There was no alternate reasoning, despite many terrorist groups desiring luxuries such as a political position, or money, the almighty god in such a meritocratic world as ours.
I pleaded for the community to listen to my warnings, but they did not. They retorted and tormented, as they were required to be with their families for Christmas. And I was deserted as an individual among the millions within my country.

"""MY MEAT CUBES ARE COMPLETED!""
Mario was going to be a genius. He had spent 20 years planning on getting bunches of meat into large cubes. Geometrically perfect. Full of seasoning, seconds away from being perfectly cooked.
He was on his way to the Italian government to show the result of his research. His years of sweet, meaty research. He had nearly doubled his cholesterol with this project.
Mario strolled across his lab to the window, letting in sunlight for the first times in forever, the sun nearly cooking his eyes from lack of prior exposure.
""Hey everybody look! Mario's back!""
Once his eyes had cleared and his vision returned, he saw his friends Luigi and Bluigi outside on their lawn. They were playing bocce, as they usually did on Saturday.
Mario opened the window, the warm wind hit his face. He forgot what the outside world felt like, it felt almost as good as a perfectly measured meat cube.
""I've found a...""
""Yeah yeah yeah, we heard you scream earlier about a meat cube. Great. Come play some bocce!""
Mario missed bocce so much. He tore through his house, looking for his precious bocce set. He tore up his kitchen, his living room, his bedroom, only to find that he didn't have a bocce set, and he was super dehydrated.
He went back to his window, Luigi was in locked in form, literally ready to roll.
""I don't have a set.""
""Well I guess you're going to miss out, Bella's coming by to watch.""
Oh Bella, Bella was the most beautiful girl the entire world. Bronze, tall, great credit, she was everything a man in Italy could want. But she was definitely married.
""Bella is married isn't she?""
""You really have been in there forever. Bollario was a Juventus fan and found out that Bella liked Torino. The marriage was over a long while ago.""
Mario realized he had to play. He had to bocce his way into Bella's heart.
But how? How could he roll something pretty heavy down a grass lawn?
Now, the heart works faster than the brain sometimes. Such was the case with Mario. He moved swiftly towards his meat cubes, and balled each of them into a large ball, putting them in the freezer.
His moment of regret washed over with visions of Mario, winning bocce, Bella jumping up and down in celebration, totally remembering who he was.
""Mario, she's here! We're going!"" Luigi yelled from the yard.
""I'll be down there right on time!"" Mario said, taking his ice cold, weighty meat balls out of the freezer, and arriving to the bocce ball game 15 minutes later.
If any of you have seen a meatball before, you know that it's not going to roll like other balls. However, because there was no meatball before this moment, nobody realized that. You could hear Mario's heart shatter as his meat bocce ball stopped dead in front of him. Bella yawned.
Wrecked with shame, not helped with the zealous laughter of Luigi. Mario returned to his home, never to leave again. Meanwhile, Luigi had a nice dinner with Bella and even had the foresight to put Mario's now thawed out meatballs onto some spaghetti. They of course, died of salmonella shortly after, because uncooked meat that has sat in the sun for two long gets infected very quickly.
Listen, nobody knows how the meatball was invented, just enjoy it ok.",0
"Stela Malsano confounded every epidemiologist, even someone as knowledgeable as Dr. Anna Walker.
Most diseases, you see, spread from an initial vector of infection. A man stumbles into a garbage heap with an open sore and picks up a dangerous bacterium which proceeds to multiply in his body, then spreads it around by coughing and vomiting. A woman orders an exotic undercooked fish at a Japanese sushi restaurant harboring pathogens from the ocean and kisses her children at home. Once the responsible anchors itself in the host, it starts to reproduce and eventually breaks free to infect others. The self-catalytic process repeats itself until it either runs out of hosts, is contained, or simply expires.
Not Stela Malsano. When it erupted, it did so instantly around the entire globe as though someone had suddenly pulled a lever, flipped a switch, pressed a button. Entire families on the far side of the earth awoke screaming with vivid hallucinations. Chaos ensued on the highways as drivers seized with convulsions and caught in the grip of lifelike trances lost control of their vehicles, often fatally. Dr. Anna, attending a colloquium on multiverse influence at the University of Illinois, bore witness to the entire room suddenly get up and run around screaming with lunatic abandon. Some thought the zombie apocalypse had begun; others were convinced that the Rapture was imminent. For a terrifying moment of penetrating clarity Anna wondered if the entire world had gone mad leaving her as the sole sane observer; almost as quickly, the rational part of her mind suggested the logical counterexample that she might be the only madwoman in a world of normalized lunacy.
She was tall for a woman, over six feet in height, with a stern sharp handsomeness to her features. Persistent asthma had plagued her since her late teenage years, but even now as a well-respected professor in her late forties she could force her way past the young graduate student raving about lunar light and barricade herself in her office in the Department of Epidemiology. Panicked screams seeped through the walls in muffled bursts like corrosive waves of toxic miasma and Dr. Anna fumbled for her phone. Her children. Please let them be alright. Risking a peek outside the office window unveiled the panorama of pandemonium; every human seemed to have gone mad simultaneously outside, running drunkenly into sides of buildings, stumbling, falling, rising up to do it again. The ubiquitous pigeons pecking for seeds on the grassy quads fluttered up to the trees, annoyed by the chaos of their usually orderly lunch. Indignant bird features ruffled at the irrational commotion; fine, let the earthbound simians stumble around like tangled marionettes!
The hysteria died down within a day, though its effects lingered on the human consciousness for quite some time afterwards. Laboratory epidemiologists almost immediately found the prions responsible for the outbreak, mysteriously dormant again. Radio pundits suggested terrorism. China and North Korea blamed each other. Churches saw record attendance on the next Sunday while public services faced the staggering prospect of repairing wrecked infrastructure left in the wake of the Stela Malsano. After-the-fact reports trickling in from around the globe confirmed that the epidemic had erupted all at once, near simultaneously.
It took a long time for life to resume some semblance of normalcy after the outbreak.
Alone in her office, Anna's phone finally connected. ""M-mom?!"" a frightened teenage voice asked in trepidation. In the background, Anna discerned more rabid screams and shrieks all around. ""What's happening?! Are you alright? Where are you -""
""Leah? Leah! Oh thank goodness you're safe."" She had to raise her voice to be heard; the professor nearly jumped out of her skin as a raving man collided with her office door and then sped down the hall. ""Where's your brother? Is he okay?""
""I don't know! He's was in another class. I'm in the girls' bathroom, the stall is locked - mom, what's happening?"" Poor Leah sounded on the verge of a breakdown and Anna forced herself to consciously suppress her own sense of rising panic. ""I'm so scared!""
The flood of psychiatric assessments and interviews after the epidemic brought to light a number of common symptoms. Vivid hallucinations, often of the moon. Others spoke of a disturbing, sickly emerald light that filled their vision. Societal upheaval inevitably followed: drug addicts swore off their vices to become productive, hard-working citizens while productive, hard-working citizens swore off their virtues to become drug addicts. Dr. Anna, often forced to spend much of her time writing grant proposals to scrounge money from whichever source might be willing to spare her some change for research, suddenly found herself inundated with more funding than she could use. Her senior graduate student quit his studies to go on a journey of spiritual enlightenment. Anxiety-induced deaths spiked sharply worldwide that month. Nine months later, a record number of babies were born globally.
""Leah - Leah, honey, listen to me. I'll come and get you. Stay safe where you are,"" Anna told her, steadying her own quavering voice. Fear for her children overrode trepidation of the screaming masses outside. ""Stay safe. I love you, Skye,"" she finished the call with an affectionate touch of her daughter's middle name. Dr. Anna picked up a plastic ruler more for a sense of security than practical self-defense before emerging from her office into the world consumed by madness.

The Governor, rather pleased with himself, looked up to the Enforcer. ""There you see, Lord Vader? She can be reasonable. Proceed with the operation. You may fire when ready.""",0
"""C'mon gang, let's investigate! There have to be some clues around here somewhere!""
""But Freeeddiiiiee, this place is so creeeeepy! Not to mention it clashes with my outfit...""
""Don't worry Daphne, we're right on the Creeper's trail, I know it! Maybe we should split up and look for clues...""
""I'm not sure that's such a good idea, Fred.""
""Like, yeah, what if the C-C-C-Creeper shows up?!""
*bark! bark! *
""See, Scooby agrees with me!""
I sat up, walking over to the door of the cell and looking through the bars as best I could. Maybe...maybe these children could help me? ""Pardon!"" I shouted, knocking on my door a few times for emphasis. ""Excuse me, children? Please, come here, I'm in need of your help!""
The group that sauntered up to the door were...textbook, in a sense. Superiority Complex. Narcissism. Mild case of Autism, possible indicators of savant tendencies. Schizophrenia. Probably the only one in a relatively healthy mental state was the Great Dane, and even that assessment was mostly due to the fact that I'd never studied much animal psychology.
""Zoinks! Like, what're you doing in there, Doc?!"" the lanky schizophrenic asked. I leaned in close to the bars, whispering. I didn't want to be heard after all.
""I hate to break it to you, but I think there may be...a *madman* running around here, in a *mask and costume*! Please, let me out, I need to get the situation under control, there are some very dangerous people in this facility...""
""A creeper in a costume? I knew it!"" Fredrick exclaimed, and I gave him the least patronizing smile I could muster. Nodding, I pointed down the hall, explaining exactly where the keys were in the office. I went into a bit of detail about the man wandering around Arkham, dressed in a terrifying guise, using fear as a weapon. He fashioned himself a professional, but in all reality he was just a disturbed man preying on the weak.
""Gosh, who woulda thought!"" the red-haired teen exclaimed, looking around nervously. ""Do you know where the flashlights are? I wouldn't want to get caught alone by someone like that!""
""I certainly do,"" I replied as the door swung open, stepping out and shaking Velma's hand vigorously. As I suspected, she grew visibly uncomfortable at the sudden physical contact. ""Let me get them for all of you. I'm very grateful for the help, but, erm...who exactly are you all...?""
That was enough to let their self-proclaimed leader dominate the conversation for a few minutes, while I traced a familiar route to the western wing. Whenever he'd start losing steam, I'd simply ask another question about his constant exploits, or Velma's eidetic memory, or Scooby's intelligence. More than once the dog would yap and everyone in the group would turn to look at it. Perhaps they had some mass hallucination, because they'd act as though the brown mutt had said something profound or funny.
""Say, Doc, where are we headed, anyway?"" Fred asked, looking around at the change in scenery. No cells here, just offices and laboratories with projects sitting half-finished on tables.
""I need to fetch some things, Fredrick,"" I explained, finally finding the door I was looking for. Locked, of course. I started turning drawers upside down, looking for the keys. ""Chemicals, mostly, for taking care of the psychopath.""
Finally, after tearing apart half the offices, I found the ring that had the all-important keys on it. Stalking back to the heavy bolted door, I started trying them one by one.
""They won't...like...hurt him or anything, will they?""
""Yeah, we've got great ideas for some traps we can set up to catch --""
""No, and no."" I replied, searching the shelves. Face cream. Joy buzzer. Green hat. Metal umbrella.
""Jinkies...what is all this stuff? They don't look like doctor's tools!""
""No, they're not."" Toga. Bullwhip. Coin with a well-worn face.
""Doc...uh, why do you keep your chemicals in here?""
""I don't, Daphne, others do."" Puppet with a tommy-gun. Giant rubber mallet. Top hat with a 10/6 size tag tucked into it. A-*ha*. I bent down, collecting my tools again at last.
*bark! bark! *
""Answer Scooby, man, what kinda doctor are you?""
""Hmm?"" I pulled the piece of brown burlap over my face, fixing the filter over my nose and mouth. I fiddled a second with the gloves as I stood up, no taller but a much more imposing presence. ""I"" m a psychologist, sir, I study phobias. Johnathan Crane, at your service.""
Giving it a test spray, I smiled behind the mask. Still in working order, with spare cartridges sitting right next to the gloves in the evidence room. The outfit would have to wait; I had research to conduct, after all. No shortage of subjects, either.
""So tell me...do you know true fear?"" I stared at Freddie, the only one not backing away from me on instinct. Boy still had a little fight in him. I gave raised my hand, finger on the release mechanism for the gas.
""...Would you like to?""",0
"Genetics are such a strange thing, such a bizarre coincidence of DNA and traits. Take me for example. I have a very unique genome. Immutable, my doctor calls it. Apparently that means that even when bitten by a vampire, attacked by a werewolf, or even cursed by magic, I remain human. Stubbornly so, in fact. I'm nearly 1400 years old, yet another strange trait of my immutable genome. My cells replicate perfectly, giving me a theoretical immortality and I don't really get sick. Like I said, genetics are funny. When I was born, I remember being treated as a freak, someone strange and different. My doctors took a lot of blood and tissue samples, and I remember spending a lot of time with needles in me. Then of course, came the Upheaval.
It started about fifty years after I was born, and it continued for nearly three centuries. Mankind slowly went extinct, our place taken by the supernatural creatures of legends. No one really knows how it started, but it began in Europe. Vampires and Werewolves emerged and began killing and turning everyone they could find. Then came the Fomor, the Seelie and Unseelie, and all the other Gloaming creatures. By the end, every human had been turned or killed, except one. I was kept as a science experiment by one of the vampire lords, a man named Kristoff, who continually subjected me to new methods of turning me. He was actually pretty chill about the whole thing, going out of his way to make sure that I wasn't harmed by his experiments.
Kristoff had enemies though, and eventually he was killed, his household liberated. Thinking I was one of his house, I was cast out into the world, the last human left. Finding a job was easy, since the majority of the new species were nocturnal, jobs that needed to be done throughout the day were in high supply. I work as a solar panel tech, keeping a massive farm of panels working for the Unseelie Court. They could handle the day, but they preferred the night, and they hated iron and steel, meaning it was difficult for them to manage their solar farms. Enter me, their werewolf tech. I'm not really a werewolf, but it means I get a three day paid vacation every month at the full moon, a vacation I use to go fishing.
The Unseelie are actually pretty great bosses, definitely misrepresented in human literature. They have a ton of rules, and they apply to workers, meaning I get paid excellently and I have a great benefits package. My doctor, working with patient confidentiality, knows I am human, and helps me manage. He files reports saying I'm a werewolf and he's been super helpful getting me meals that are balanced, sneaking me supplements to assist my meat-filled diet. Basically, he's my rock. Fortunately for me, he's a Elder Fae, and is more immortal than I am, so I don't have to worry about a new doctor every hundred years or so.
He's been fascinated by my genome, just like Kristoff was, and I do my best to make sure he has lots of samples. I figure keeping him happy is the least I can do. As the world's oldest and only human, I keep my head down and watch as the world changes. When the Upheaval first happened, the technology level dropped significantly, until the supernatural creatures began to understand humanity's technology. Now, my Fae doctor takes MRIs, uses 3D Holo Matrices to plot my genome, and does scans using long wave light scans. Not only did the supernatural creatures understand our technology, they also resumed our expansion. Now, nearly 1400 years later, the Earth is a utopia, each race well-represented and well-treated. As a human born in the the late 1900s, I wake up every day fascinated by how the world has changed. Floating cities, space travel, and even flying cars, have now become the norm.
All in all then, this world's not so bad. I make a good living, I have lots of friends, and I recently started seeing an Unseelie Fae, a girl named Mashian, who's even older than I am. I've even been thinking of sharing my secret with her, so hopefully she's okay dating a human. Anyway, that's life in 1358 A.U. It's different that I expected when I was a kid, but it's not bad. Not bad at all.",0
"Time stands still, and he appears. Deaths robes licked the cold tile as he entered the room to claim his latest victim. Darkness flowed from them onto the floor like a mist, shrouding his movements as he shifted his frame towards the hospital bed.
He allowed his eyes to rest for a moment on the young woman that lie there. Golden blonde hair, rose colored cheeks, icy blue eyes. How unfortunate she must feel at this moment, how awful to be her. Her husband collapsed on the white tile floor next to her, the pain of loss must have been terrible for him. Death had, of course seen this before, many times. But in cases like this, he could not help himself from feeling an amount of regret and empathy for the departings kin. The world was not fair, not right, but it was not for him to decide, he had a job to do. Death claims all, no matter the circumstances.
His victim lie still, and death looked on. A stillborn baby, the very opposite of himself, yet still the very essence of himself. Here is what should have been life. What should have been happiness. But the world was not fair, not right, and he had a job to do, it was not for him to decide. He reached for the young soul and grasped it gently.
He paused for a brief moment and felt the warmth from the soul on his bone like fingers. ""You are young and do not know sadness or joy, and so this may mean little to you but, I do not wish to claim you."" The souls warmth remained. Death felt a small pulsation coming from it. It glowed a warm hue of the purest golden white, untainted by the years of hurt that life brings. He looked at the small body in which it came from, fragile and motionless.
""I will watch you closely, little soul. I expect great things in return for this,"" Deaths voice rumbled deeply as he reached out to the stillborn child's body a second time. ""not everyone gets a second chance at life, but everyone deserves a first chance.""
Death released the warm, vibrant soul back to where it came, and glided back to the door. ""Until we meet again, little one."" he said.
As he made his exit from the room, he could hear the child's first gasp of air, followed by a cry. The world may not be fair, not right, but today Death respected life. He would watch over this one, to see what good his empathy brought the world of fragile men.",0
"The air in the room hangs dense with a sense of dread. Another day gone, another night present, another opportunity to let the feelings creep into her core. She sits at the edge of the bed, face damp, staring at the wooden floor underneath her feet. A lamp at the corner provides dim lighting. A fan overhead slowly turns, pressing air gently against her skin
She is a girl, probably the almost-perfect girl, who takes advantage of every minute of her youth. She is a girl who beams her smiles, tells her jokes, and laughs her laughs. She is a girl with plenty of friends, most would say, who sometimes come visit her in that room.
""Why do you do this to yourself?"" asks a voice, one quite close, laced with softness moreso than her own.
The girl continues to stare at the floor, her focus elsewhere.
""Why?"" the voice continues, even softer. It is quiet. That is not a question the girl knows the answer to. ""Want to know something?""
Reluctantly, the girl nods.
""I care about you""
The girl wipes part of her face with her forearm. She sniffles a bit, half believing the voice and half thinking it lies.
""Do you want a hug?"" asks the voice. Again, the girl barely manages a nod. ""Okay, good.""
Warmth surrounds the girl and, after a few moments, it seeps into her core. It doesn't expel the familiar sense of dread, but it gives it company.
""Do you feel better?"" she is asked. The girl shifts slightly in that bed and a breaks her gaze from the floor. Her mouth curls slightly. Not a smile, but almost.
""Yeah, I do"" mutters the girl, almost to herself. ""A bit, at least""
""Good"" replied the voice, happier this time. ""You're okay. Can you say that to yourself?"" The words hang in the dense air in that room.
""I can"". She pauses. ""I'm okay""
""You're okay"" quickly follows the voice. ""And I'm here for you""
A slight smile paints itself onto the girl. She inhales deeply and slowly exhales, a sense of calm flowing through her. Another night about to end, another opportunity to see tomorrow.
She is a girl, far a from perfect, still with more time left in her youth. She is a girl who on the outside perhaps seems joyous, but no one has ever known her deeper than that. She is a girl, a lonely girl, which no one would say, and the only person in the room that night.",0
"Now deep down in hell, where the sinners stood
Somethin' bad was brewin', it was nothin' good
The demon lords were squabblin', down to a man
About who'd rule them all, and be the one in command!
Satan started roarin', with his eyes ablaze
""'Tis I who ruled the underworld, for all of my days!
You other sinners better bow, 'cause you can't compare:
I'm the biggest, baddest demon lord! And *I've* got the most flair!""
But Lucifer, he wouldn't take this insult sittin' down
He stood right up and paced about his face in a frown
""You might have ruled till now, with your iron fist
But it was ME who started up this whole affair, you get my gist?
I'm the first to sin, the giant on which you stand:
If anything it should be YOU beneath MY command!""
Then Beelzebub, now, he wouldn't settle for this
He flew into the air on the foulest of mists
""Now you two have the royal claim, that much I know true
But I have one question to pose! a quandary for you!'
Our final goal is Heaven, wouldn't we all agree?
But since *I* rule the skies, you can't do it without me!""
Then Abbadon stood, rising up in a flash
The beneath his feet began to shake, and teeth did gnash!
""Listen here, you mothers son's,'tis *I* who should rule!
If any think your better, then you're naught but a fool!
'Tis *I* who rules the Earth, and brings on the end of all days
So all you better kneel or else get out of my way!""
But Belial was never one to be left out
He called upon the fire in the earth to spout
""If ANYONE is fit to rule, it ought to be me!
If it weren't for my flames, where would all of YOU be?""
Leviathan leapt to her feet, freezing the stone
""You all better step back, I'll freeze you all to the bone
'Tis I who rules the seas, and bring the frost as well
None of you could rule like me, a snowball in hell!""
And so they fought, their petty squabble over a pit
But way up there in heaven, God is laughing a fit!
Together, they would all be one hell of a threat
But so long as they keep fighting, well, they're all wet!
Pride's a dreadful sin, and Heaven does agree
It is better off for everyone to leave them be!

*Tried for a bit of a jazzy theme this time. If you enjoyed, check out more of my work over at /r/TimeSyncs! *",0
"**Rule #1: Don't wish for world peace. It just doesn't work out, okay? **
**Rule #2: Wish for something simple, like a new IPad, or something. **
** Rule #3: If you found a random monkey paw on your way back home from work, leave it behind. **
It won't do you any good.
Monotony was something that I loathed, hated with a passion. At 7:04am, I would be in my car driving to the train station. I would catch the 7:19am into the city, and be at work around 9:00. I'd sit at my cubicle typing away at the assorment of keys (mostly the backspace button). I leave at 5:00pm, get on the train, drive back home, eat my dinner, and crash into bed. Day after day this routine happened. It never left me, it never entertained me, it never did anything but just be.
I would have agreed with anyone who said that sounds boring. I would have said that I rather be doing anything other than that.
I crossed by the monkey paw on my walk up to the train station from my car. There's this dirt path that was once paved, but my town decided it was more important to buy new speed bumps to help ""save the children"". Pretty sure that the children were already ""saved"" but now I need this damn town to fix my sanity.
It looked like a hairy hand, just peeking out from the bushes. I though it was just Buck Landon's, our town drunk. Every town has one of those, right? Maybe the community could choose to ""save the drunkards"". So I went to check on him, but ended up with a monkey paw. Why was a monkey paw just lying in the bushes? That probably should have been one of my wishes.
Speaking of wishes, somehow this monkey paw granted 5. Probably should have spent another wish asking how the fuck a monkey paw has magical powers. I ended up wishing for the stereotypical things. The things that would take me away from the roads of monotony. But don't be fooled, wishes don't come without consequences.
You won't be in my situation dealing with being in a hospital with incompetent fucks not being able to decide whose going to help you.
""No I insist, you have so much more skill and talent. ""
""No, No, you are much more capable in communicating with the patient!""
How 'bout one of you doctors come here and fix my broken dick. Which reminds me of the last rule:
** Rule #4: Don't wish for unlimited sex. **
So if you find a monkey paw on the street, trust me, and leave it behind.
It will not do you any good.

"""Can you hook me up?""
I looked at the kid in front of me, he was, with a liberal guess, fifteen. But he was obviously resourceful, he managed to find me in this haunted city.
""Well, it depends on what you want."" I said.
""I want a *discern. *""
*Discern*. Ah. That was an expensive item, because of the nature of it. You could rifle through anyone's head. It was also an extremely uncommon find. What did a fifteen year old want a discern for?
""Why?""
""It's getting you money, you don't really need to know."" He gripped his armrests and seemed extremely angry at the question.
""Hey, buddy. How about you cool your tone and answer the question."" I said. Stupid children. They always underestimate while simultaneously overestimate the raw power of commands.
""Well, there's a girl, and I don't know if she likes me or not."" He said, with a straight face.
I laughed. Hard. I laughed so hard tears streamed down my face. I finally retained my composure and I looked up at the kid. He looked very unsettled.
""What are you willing to give me for it?"" I asked, at last.
""Well, my grandpa said he's willing to give up his, but you have to give him *overpower* too."" The boy replied.
""What is his word?"" I said, wondering what could be so esoteric that his grandfather thought he could get two of such powerful commands.
""Enchant.""
""Deal, bring him here and I'll do it."" I said, greedily. Enchant was a big deal, especially for a salesman like myself. I've only seen three in the wild, and no one was willing to sell. This must be a special case.
""Hey, son."" I said, before right before he walked out the door.
""Yeah?"" He asked, turning around.
""Why does your grandfather want the *overpower*, instead of *enchant*?""
""He has cancer. He's hoping to *overpower* it."" He said, and he left.
I sat down and poured a drink. Today was a good day. Saving a life, getting *enchant*, only losing one of my two overpowers, and a discern.
I loved being born with *transfer. *",0
"One.
One planet in the unimaginably vast universe has the perfect mix of chemicals and the right zap of energy at just the right point in time to bring life. Unique.
When scientists scanned every other planet and we realized that humanity was truly alone in a godless, lifeless universe everyone just lost it. The politicians in power met at the last UN summit in a somber tone making a decision for all of us, all of our kind, we could not bear it. Alone.
Finding a chemical mixture to attack the carbon chains and molecules of life on Earth was surprisingly easy, they released it into the atmosphere and we all watched as everything died. We have minutes left, every breath burns with the acid destroying us.
Alone in the Universe we were told by the scientists. They could find no one else.",0
"The men laughed as the little girl emerged from behind the city gates.
""THIS IS MY HOME!"" She yelled. ""WE ARE GOD'S PEOPLE! TURN BACK NOW AND LIVE; OR CONTINUE ON, AND DIE!""
The small army found this hilarious. ""And what are you going to do, eh little girl? Why don't you call your Daddy and let him handle grown-men's business?""
""I did,"" she replied, drawing her knife. ""I called on my Father in Heaven. And He will grant me victory on this day, if you do not turn around and go back to from whence you came.""
One man grabbed a sword and stepped forward, roaring, ""Enough of this! This little girl taunts us!""
He approached her, but she approached him even more swiftly, and slew him with the knife.
Three more men approached and were too slain. City watchers saw this from the gate, and the little girl's fearless display excited them to call all the soldiers. And then the city opened up, and all the soldiers within, swept out and chased the small army back along the trail and slain them all along the route. Not a man survived.
The girl fell to her knees in the sand, and prayed, ""Thank you, Father.""",0
"As I lay there experiencing the gift, the wonderful release, I had before delivered to so many before me I strangely felt as if I were going somewhere else. Expecting this to be my final reward to meet those whom I had sent before me to prepare my final reward, I was shocked to feel...Fear. A foreign emotion I rarely experienced, but had felt it enough to know what I was being subjected to. I then opened my eyes to see me. I was standing there in the secret place I only knew, the place that would usher so many to the place of rest and reward but for some reason this view was different.
I looked down and saw I was kneeling, and for some reason wearing a torn skirt, with chains around my ankles. I looked back up and involuntarily let out a shriek as my beloved sledgehammer came down upon my own skull, and yet I feel nothing, a perfect hit instantly turning the brain into a puddle within the skull. Yet somehow I open my eyes and see myself in the same spot, only wearing different clothes this time, with a gag in my mouth as I, the true I, not the bastardized version of some mongrel only fit to serve myself in the afterlife that I currently find myself in; walk up and, using my left hand, lovingly caress the neck of the body I find myself in. I pull back, knowing what is about to happen but cannot stop the muffled scream from coming as the other hand comes forward lightning fast and plunges an ice pick into the eye of the body I currently reside in. It does not kill me as I knew it wouldn't, this time I wanted to see how a subject would react to a slower death, and I screamed in pain as the pick went into my ocular cavity, breaking into the bone found below the eye. Though it felt like an eternity he, for I was no longer him, removed the pick from my eye and mercifully penetrated my temple, ending my short and pathetic, yet somehow tragically beautiful life.
I was not surprised as I became the third victim, and the fourth. Each experiencing unique deaths. No I did not appreciate the way I slew myself as I had when I was only the one preparing the afterlife. This time I thought back to the strange memories I had been suppressing, the hopes and dreams that were not mine. I thought of my widowed mother whose husband had died trying to defuse an IED in Afghanistan, wondering how she could survive losing another she loved. Or to my basset hound at my apartment, hoping one of my friends would come by like they promised they would and notice me missing.
When I became the fifth I tried to fight the monster before me. Actually managing to sprain his ankle before he shattered my knee. I had just been accepted into the Police Academy the day I went out drinking and disappeared for 3 months, only to be found by a game warden during deer season. As the sixth I plead for my life despite realizing this was my punishment from God for raping those girls in college.
Finally, as the 7th I felt peace. I watched as the FBI SWAT team burst into the shed, serendipitously matching the first burst of blood escaping the arteries in my neck, as the beast before me jerked the hand holding the knife, taking with it my final chance at life, jerked outward from the first stab made into my neck. I laughed as the 5.56mm rounds fired by the Agents entered the depraved monsters' body. But my laughs only came out as choking gasps. I could feel myself bleed out both as this poor soul on the floor, who was watching the team medic desperately try to pinch off his arteries, and as the monster I finally realized I truly was. The only odd thing I felt as I slipped towards whatever hell I surely deserved, was a feeling of elation; knowing society was finally free of me.",0
"**Odyssey of the Edrathi: A 'Home' At Last? **
Our homeworld is long dead, and few of us remain. There were many ""flotilla fleets"" like ours, although what has become of them, who can say? Do the people of Ukrub still number in the millions at least, or are the 437,521 survivors in our fleet all that remain of our race? Even with the tetradrives to travel a lightyear in the span of a month, it would take centuries to properly contact the other fleets, and who's to say we would ever receive an answer?
Years of rotating individuals between waking work and cryosleep, the prohibition of bearing children except in extreme circumstances, the reclamation of any and all resources onboard our ships, all to keep us going until we found another planet to settle. We found such a world through the telescopes, the closest world brimming with life in our otherwise barren sector, and set up a string of jumps towards that planet. As we drew ever closer, however, we were able to see the clustered lights on the nightside, and learned that we were indeed not alone in this cold unforgiving universe. We had been given new hopes and fears in a single stroke, for while it was a world harbouring an alien intelligence, we knew so little about the pale, gaunt creatures that trotted about without claws or tails, only their deformed spines and lanky legs enabling them to walk upright.
As we crossed into the heliosphere into the system, a translation project was started up to dissect and analyse the wild and blurry transmissions echoing forth from that noisy little garden, and we found something most intriguing. Many of the transmissions were spoken in a similar language to that heard in the Book of Rush, many of the words spoken lining up to the words of the lead singer on the original holographic tapes. This planet, could it be ""Erth""? Could these tall furless beings be the Elda race of Mann? In our efforts to survive the destruction of Ukrub, had we stumbled upon the birthplace of the gods?
Even with this grand revelation, we were yet again surprised when we intercepted quite an intriguing signal, what seemed to be a binary transmission of sorts, 3217 octobits in size. The signal continued for exactly 252 seconds before it stopped, and the second we had the complete message our engineers set about trying to decipher it. By freak chance, one of them arranged it into 111 rows, each row being 28 units long, and found what appeared to be a vertical series of blocky pictograms.
What we noticed first was that this world appeared to operate on Base-12, seemingly due to how their paws had 5 digits as opposed to our 4. I remember counting the digits on their paws, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12. Then I counted mine, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10. Creepy, but made a surprising amount of sense. Then came the second collection of numbers, 1, 6, 7, 10, 17. We lined them up to the atomic numbers of the 5 elements essential for genetic molecules, and lo and behold the third section of the message showed representations of molecular formulae for every nucleotide present in the genetic code, followed by a symbol of the double helix and what appeared to be 37,775,775,536 base pairs, roughly the size of our own genome though possibly exaggerated. Maybe it was an early approximate on their part?
The following sections depicted the Elda, in height and in population, then the worlds in their system, for some reason counting a very small dwarf world we found to be rather rich in nitrogen ice with pockets of frozen methane, and finally what appeared to be a radio telescope, presumably the source of the signal. With the project wrapped up, we continued our voyage past the gas giants and through that asteroid belt of theirs, until the remains of our fleet, all 437,521 refugees on board, came into orbit around an Erth mysteriously devoid of major space structures. There were an abundance of satellites, yes, and a small collection of pods and panels that constituted a rather primitive space station, but beyond that we were left quite confused.
Through surface scans we were able to see the sprawling metropolises of the Elda race, and there were undoubtedly people in great abundance, but they appeared transfixed by something. Some were glued to their media devices, while others stared up into the infinite skies, but all shared similar expressions. Unease, anxiety, fear, excitement, emotions we had gleaned from their visual transmissions en-route to Erth. Some great tragedy, we presumed, as we scanned for areas far from the cities, suitable zones to land and establish our colonies. After all, if they weren't using the wild spaces, surely they would not object to a race in need making efficient use of the land, right? How naive we were...
At first, our colonies remained safe and the colonists rejoiced in the free air, drinking deep of natural waters and finally breeding freely as our ancestors did. Then came the Elda, and when they came across us, we learned that they were not nearly as wizened and powerful as we thought, that they were not a unified species at all. While the majority of ""contact"" instances between us and the ""humans"" were cautious and slow, a few of our colonies on the Eurasian supercontinent met a horrifying fate. Men with guns and bombs, intent on clearing us from their lands like mere vermin! I still have nightmares about what I read in those reports...
Needless to say, we would not consider the ""Russians"" or ""Middle Easterners"" as trading partners, and despite the heavy trade sanctions already in place on the former, they consistently refused the calls to pay reparations for the Siberian Massacres. I shudder to think how life would have been if Russia still had that ""Soviet Union"" of theirs. But otherwise, the majority of U.N members came to accept the edrathi as a nation of our own, though there is still unease between our species on the whole. Unless humanity wipes itself out with atomics, perhaps our two kinds can learn from one-another, and find joy in the world we now share. While the lost children of Ukrub might not technically belong on Earth, it is the only place our once proud race can call home...",0
"It was supposed to be a routine mission. Nothing we hadn't seen before. Just another cleanup round trip through the washing machine and the dryer. We'd done this a hundred times. But I guess even if you've been on the force for years they still can surprise you.
The trip through the washer went without any trouble. Lev was showing off his newly patched heel during the ride. Red wool. Apparently that's the fashion nowadays. Said I should get my own looked at. Don't see a reason to. Yea, my heel is getting sheer, but it's still holding up. I don't trust those shrinks and tailors. Don't like needles. Lev just grins.
I always get the shivers when we enter the dryer. Call it childhood trauma, but we all got our baggage. I got used to it, but this time something is different. We are getting pushed too far off to the side.
""Lev, I don't like this place. Smells awful lot like a trap to me"", I mumble and pull up my cuff.
""You worry too much, Rick. Come on, partner, what could possibly go wrong?"" Lev leans back and pokes the polished metal wall of the dryer. ""They build these things to be safe. The other day I read that you are more likely to get burnt by lightning than to disappear in a dryer.""
He doesn't convince me. I pull a bundle of fluff from my pocket and start chewing on it. Old habits die hard.
Then we start spinning. I try not to think about it. I need to distract myself. ""So how's your patched heel holding up?"", I ask.
No answer.
""Lev?"" I turn to look at him, but his space is empty. ""LEV!""
Hectically, I scan the area. My world is spinning. Literally. Suddenly I spot something. A thin thread of red, caught in a gap of the drum. I give it a closer look. It's good quality wool, and the same color as Lev's new fucking patch.
""Shit."" I look down into the gap. Darkness. ""Lev? Are you down there?"" The thread twitches. Without further thought, I jump into the darkness.
When I come back to my senses, every single one of my threads hurt. I think some of them might be ruptured. I check my heel. Still sheer, but no permanent damage. So far so good. I try to get my bearings. Where the hell am I? I can't see a damn thing. I hear the rumbling hum of the dryer above me. I must have slipped into the bowels of the beast. It is pitch black. I feel something lying on the ground. Lev's thread. I grab it and crawl forward. The place is cramped, the air is hot and wet. Slowly I adjust to the darkness. I can see pipes and eagerly turning gears. Steam hits my gusset, but I crawl onward.
Suddenly, the ground disappears beneath my foot and I fall again.
The landing is soft. Softer than I'd like. A bad feeling grips me. Bodies. Heaps of them. I hear a moan.
""Lev?""
Silence. I carefully pat the ground beneath me. ""Rick?"" I hear a weak voice whisper.
""Lev! Buddy, I am coming for you!"" Frantically I start clawing my way towards the faint sound. Then I find him. He is leaning against the wall, limp and barely holding up.
""Rick. Rick, they got me.""
""Don't talk now, I gotta patch you up. I'll get you outta here.""
""No, it's too late for that. I'm sorry."" He shifts and so I can see his heel. My voice fails. His side is torn open all the way from cuff to foot.
""They got me good."" He tries to laugh, but he only coughs out loose threads. ""Real shame about the wool.""
""You can't do this to me! We are a team god dammit! Don't you dare chicken out now!""
""You were right all along, Rick. This place is a deathtrap. You have to-"" He breaks off, coughing up more threads. ""You have to put an end to this.""
I grimace.
""Promise me."" Then he goes limp. Even more so than before.
I get up. Time to end this. I look up at the twisting gears and spit a ball of fluff at it. The gnawing metal teeth eagerly dig into it. The machine halts for a moment, chokes but then the gears rip the fine threads apart and the dryer roars to life again.
I sigh. Looks like I'll need something tougher. I find myself a new ball of fluff to chew and start running towards the twisting gears. I'm no use without a partner anyway. I'm coming for you, Lev.",0

"Here you are again. Back to same point you were 365 days ago. Your house littered with empty bottles. You keep telling yourself this year is it. The year you will finally get your life back on track. But you can't. Alone. Nothing but an empty shell of your former self. You throw away the last mirror in your house. You take one final look, disgusted. The only evidence of your existence remains in a photo of you and her. You take a final swig and collapse helplessly on the floor. Your dreams soon become bitter memories. You remember five years ago you told her the same resolution you made this year, but you lied to her then. You never did that before. She asked if you were okay to drive after that New Years Eve party, and you said ""Yes."". Another lie….Another failed resolution.",0
"Gary settled himself into his office chair and logged into the prayer inbox. He sighed with an air of trepidation as he opened the spam folder, ready to sort the few genuine prayers out from the mindless drivel that had somehow made its way in. He'd been asking God for a better spam filter for years, but apparently (Gary rolled his eyes) His Lord Almighty had other, more pressing issues to deal with.
Gary clicked impatiently through the junk mail.
*Praying for a great holiday break? Look no further! *
Delete.
*This man prayed for a solution to his male pattern baldness - you won't believe what he looked like three weeks later! *
Delete.
*DickTator, the simple pill guaranteed to answer your prayers for a larger manhood! *
Gary shuddered. *Definitely* delete.
Moving onto the main inbox, Gary settled in for a long day's work. He cracked his knuckles, staring at the extensive list of mail, and took a gulp from the polystyrene cup of vending machine coffee that sat next to his keyboard. Slowly, methodically, he began to work his way through the list of prayers.
Cathy, 29, who had prayed for the strength to finish a presentation for her boss, found herself imbued with a new sense of purpose as she discovered her most attractive colleague would be sitting in on the meeting. Meanwhile, Logan, 58, was granted the morning off work to watch his kid's school play, and Alfred, 84, stumbled upon his lost pen behind the sofa.
Of course, there were harder prayers too, ones Gary had to spend a little longer mapping out. He couldn't save the dying partner of Lucy, 33, from leukaemia - it was simply his time to go - but he could give him an extra moment of lucidity, and the strength to grab Lucy's hand and tell her how much he loved her. And when Andrew, 17, begged him to stop his best friend from considering suicide, Gary couldn't change the thoughts in the head of someone who hadn't prayed to him directly, but he could lift the cloud of panic from Andrew's vision just enough to let him support his friend and look for other sources of help himself.
Gary spent the last hour before lunch engineering a complex plan to allow a young teacher to discover the abuse that Leo, 6, was subjected to at home. He collapsed back, exhausted and emotionally drained, as a freak rain storm emerged over a road in Connecticut, which he hoped would delay the teacher's journey just enough for her to arrive in the school car park at the same time as Leo and his mother. The radio would be playing Leo's parents' song as they pulled into the school drive, which would make his mother cry, and that in turn would make her apologise repeatedly to Leo, betraying her true feelings in a way she rarely did when sober. And if the heat in Leo's mother's car was turned up just enough, the window would be open at the very moment that Miss Rodriguez happened to be hurrying by, close enough to overhear even a whispered confession...Gary tapped a few keys, checking that the child safeguarding policy had fluttered to the top of the teacher's desk, and nodded to himself.
Gary treated himself to a hot chocolate at lunch, although it tasted bitter against the nausea that had risen in his throat on reading Leo's prayer.
When he returned to his desk, he was worn out and not in the highest of spirits. So when he clicked a new piece of mail and was greeted by the message, ""Error 404: Prayer not found"", it was practically​ a divine miracle that he managed to limit himself to muttering his most blasphemous curses at the computer screen. He tried to navigate back to the inbox, but the message simply blinked on the screen. As many times as he reloaded the page and turned the computer off and on again, the error message stayed stubbornly put.
Gary swore bitterly enough to make most angels blush, and picked up his desk phone to dial tech support. He tapped his fingers on the edge of his desk, growing steadily more frustrated, until a young angel with a scraggly beard and a T-shirt that read, ""Byte me"" strolled in through the door, whistling so cheerfully that Gary instantaneously hated him.
The angel tapped a few keys, opening up programmes that, frankly, Gary didn't even know existed, before he announced, smiling, ""Looks like you've got yourself a virus"".
""What?""
""A computer virus. Opened any odd attachments recently? Emails from unknown senders?""
""I have to open emails from unknown senders, it's my goddamn-"" (the angel winced) ""-job.""
""Well this isn't one I've seen before, I'm going to have to get my supervisor in here to sort it out."" The angel beamed. ""She's pretty booked up, but I can probably slot you in around Thursday.""
""Thursday's not gonna cut it!""
""Sorry, dude, other people have emergencies too..."" Faced by Gary's look of withering disgust, the angel's happy glow seemed to dim a little, but it wasn't long before he'd recovered his grin and waved Gary a cheery goodbye.
Gary kicked the side of his desk, hard, and instantly regretted it as pain shot through his foot. Hopping up and down, he cursed again, before letting himself flop into his chair. He glared at the error message, still shining out from the computer screen. He couldn't answer any prayers. It would take time for things to get better for Leo, and if the boy had to resort to prayer again, Gary wouldn't even be able to read it. It would go unheeded and unanswered.
How many times had he said they ought to have a back-up system? Gary gritted his teeth, anger flashing in his eyes. Whichever asshole had sent him a virus…
Actually, that was a point. Who was capable of sending him a virus? An uneasy feeling began to coil in the pit of Gary's stomach. Most humans didn't even have the capacity to pray consciously - their thoughts were simply translated automatically into mail form. To understand the system, to send a virus, you'd have to be a supernatural being, something from heaven- or hell.
And why break the prayer operating system at all, unless you had a reason you didn't want them answered - unless you wanted the people of Earth to have to fend for themselves?
Ice flooded Gary's veins. In an instant, he had leapt from his chair, stubbing his still throbbing toe on the desk for a second time. Mingled gasps and curses spilling from his lips, he raced out of his office and into reception. He slammed his palm down on the desk.
""I need God. The Big Man. His Holiness.""
""Have you made an appointment?""
""No! This is an emergency!""
Gary could feel a vein popping out of his neck. He was on the verge of leaping over the desk and breaking into God's office himself, when a holy, eternal aura seemed to descend over the room.
""Gary."" God's voice was calm. ""What seems to be the problem.""
Gary was out of breath, and he could feel sweat beading on his skin. ""I need your advice.""",0
"Chief of the Engi, Saluy son of Davok son of Rofuy spoke ""We are the Engi. My father told this story of our beginning: Our gods cast us from the garden for our many crimes against them. Cut us out like bad crops and tossed us into the stars. The elders say that one day, the gods will call us home and forgive us; that by following their laws we may atone.
I keep the old ways. The Engi are a proud and wise people. We hold our habs and domes as we ever have against the Secu and the Offi, deadly savages and ruthless eaters of men. They are many, but our wisdom and skillcraft still serve us well.
We know the ways to grow food. Wheat for bread, for beer. Insects, pigs, fungi for meat. Fruits. No Engi child is hungry, though we are a small people- less than 100 hands among us. Of course, we have the help of the old ones, the men who are made of metal.
They, too, were cast away from the gods. My father said that the old ones came of their own will, came to aid us in our exile.
The old ones and the Engi made an ancient pact; we would keep the old ways and pray to their shrines with offerings of fruit and salvage and they would guard against the haunted dark that fills so many habs, so many domes with ice and silence and the clean picked bones of the unlucky. The old ones do not speak, but there are signs and portents of their will. Lights like stars appear on their chests, signalling by ancient decree for the sacrifice of fruit and meat.
We guard the tunnels. Our fathers, proud founders of the Engi left us with many wonders. Blades made of light, brighter than a comet. Armor to turn the rusted knives the Offi and the Secu bring, clutched in the fists of their screaming masses. Each battle, our fathers ways guide us and when the killing is done and the dead Engi are returned to the earth, the old ones move among the Secu and Offi. They take the dead away, to where we do not know. It is taboo to question or doubt the old ones in their duties.
There are other habs with old ones. The Astron study the stars and their movements. The Engi and the Astron have an old pact that we honor as they do. For our foods they provide salvage and prophecy learned from the secret language of the stars. They are a small people and food comes easy for the Engi. We share with who we can. It is our way. The Astron say that our day of reckoning is coming at last, that we are no longer passively drifting through the stars, but are moving with more purpose than before.
The - ""
Overhead, on the gantries and catwalks of the habitation dome, spinning red lights emerged from rusted shutters. Claxon warnings blared. A door, hidden by generations of rust and oxidation slid open along one wall and the drones - painted and decorated by generation after generation- slid forth.
**All occupants are to report to their pods. Repeat, all occupants are report to their pods. Entering decaying orbit. **
Saluy stopped his story in mid-breath. The children, previously wide-eyed with wonder at the story of their people were now visibly frightened.
They weren't the only ones.
Bathed by the evil red lights the Engi were in a state of near-panic. The old ones moved among them, guiding each Engi to a series of pods that had emerged from the floor, disrupting several huts. Saluy watched as several of the old ones shoved a group of frightened Engi into a pod and sealed the doors.
**All occupants are to report to their pods. Repeat, all occupants are report to their pods. Entering decaying orbit. **
Saluy leapt to his feet as the pod slid back down into the floor, the ow frenzied Engi inside pounding against the doors.
""Old One!"" He cried to the nearest rust and paint covered frame. ""What is happening?!""
The old one turned its row of circular blue lights to face him and began pushing him backward toward the door he had seen open in the wall. He pulled away and tried to duck around it. The old one locked its clamp arms around his and lifted his feet from the ground. Another began rounding up the children he had been with and ushering them toward yet another pod.
""Old One! Answer me! I know you can speak!"". It said nothing and Saluy struggled with all his might. He'd seen Old Ones lift Secu, who were all warriors of terrible strength and incredible height, effortlessly from the ground and rip them limb from limb.
The doorway was pitch black and Saluy felt a terrible chill in his guts. The Old One approached the door with calm treads and stepped inside, still carrying Saluy. Once inside, the Old One chimed a series of notes. The door slid shut with a series of clanks and squeals and a light appeared over head. The room, once lit, held no terrors. The Old One set Saluy down and turned him gently until he was facing the wall beside the door.
Before him was a chair and a small desk. On the desk was an ancient terminal. He'd seen them in the habs and domes. His father had told him they'd once held incredible knowledge and power, but had long ago gone to sleep.
The Old One pulled out the chair and gently, inexorably, pushed Saluy down into it. When he was seated, the Old One spoke for the first time. It's voice was soft and buzzed slightly.
""**Genesis. Day 360, 985. ** ""
The screen began to glow. On the screen appeared a line of words that Saluy did not know. He had learned to read of course, all the Engi did, but only the engi script. This was new.
A panel on the desk opened to reveal a square of dark plastic with the outline of a hand in blue light in the middle of it. Saluy looked back at the old one, standing still and silent once again, and decided to place his trust in the old ones, as his father had told him to. He placed his hand on the blue outline.
He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and placed his hand on the outline.
**Recognized, 33rd descendent of Chief Engineer Walter Sullivan. Descent protocol begin. **
And the ship began to tilt.
For the first time in his life, Suluy felt gravity and he didn't like it.
Had he been watching from outside the ship, he'd have seen the scarred, dark ship outlined against the blue-green disk it was now orbiting. He would have seen large engines cycle off again and the ship begin the ballet of deceleration and the jettisoning of the pods toward the surface of the planet.
He was, however, busy throwing up.
The old one approached the desk and chimed at the terminal which blinked rapidly through several operations and another panel ont he desk opened. This one held a wire harness which the old one expertly slid onto Saluy's head.
Saluy had just time to wipe his mouth, realize something was on his head and reach out to touch the trailing wire running from the headpiece to the desk before he heard the old one say:
**Initiate upload**
and his world fractured.
The upload contained so much information that to go into each item would be impossible. The gist was this, in a fraction of a second Saluy learned that the gods had not forsaken them, but had sent them to a newly discovered (1000 years ago, newly discovered that is) planet to colonize it. That the ships computer had been damaged in a revolt led by the Security staff and had gone almost entirely dormant, judging that navigation and life support would be the only systems that could not be terminated. Saluy received the equivalent of a doctoral education in Engineering and a complete briefing of the scans of and findings on the planet they were now descending to.
The old one stood behind him as hisbody jerked and shuddered, his teeth chattered and his eyes rolled in his head. Its clamp hands secured him to the chair as the ship settled into orbit and corrected the decay into the planets atmosphere. Below, the pods slashed through the planets clouds, trailing fire. Almost every one had functioning chutes and thrusters that came automatically online. Almost. Some were crushed against mountains before their chutes could open, or smashed into each other in the high air currents of the upper atmosphere. Saluy watched through the ships eyes as his people fell to their new home.
Saluy's mind linked directly with the ship's computer for only about 13 seconds, but in that time he learned everything it could teach him.
He slumped back, drool running down his chin and into his beard. Suddenly, he could smell himself for the first time.
""Gods above..."" he muttered as his vision swam. ""Gods above, I; m glad I didn't know that was going to happen...""
The old one stood silently behind him, arms now at it's sides. Saluy stood and grasped it's carbon fiber shoulder to steady himself. His head was almost literally swimming with new information. He felt a little crazy, but he figured that would pass as he adjusted and his mind got used to the new information from the upload. He felt...good.
""Droid, what is your designation?""
**X-5 21A, Chief Engineer Sullivan**
""Very well, I'm going to call you X-5 for short. Do you acknowledge?""
**Acknowledged, Chief Engineer Sullivan. **
Suluy - Sullivan - walked to the door and keyed in the code to open it. It slid open and he gazed across the habitation dome that had been his home.
""Very well. Let's go, we've got a lot of work to do and I want to start with seeing how many of the security droids we can have patrolling the ship within the day. The Secu, the Offi, they're still up here I'm betting and we need to neutralize them. Come. Let's begin. """,0
"As I ran over the gravel path to get to the hidden clearing, I glanced at my watch. Two minutes to 11. I thought back to the morning, when I found the post-it note stuck to my ceiling ""23:00 - you know where."" The handwriting was calligraphic, reminiscent of medieval manuscripts.
I slowed down, arriving at my destination and taking a second to catch my breath. I inhaled the cool winter air and surveyed the area around me. Dead grass and leaves covered the ground around me. I looked at my wrist again and saw my watch stop. The minute hand quivered. A flash of light illuminated the clearing. Blinded, I looked away until I could see my hands again. Blinking fervently, my gaze moved to the center of the clearing where a old, bearded man stood with a gnarled staff.
""Need help again, Merlin?""",0
"When I was born my father said I had stars in my eyes and a smile as bright as the sun. He told me that as long as I was near, happiness was sure to follow. He was a busy man who built gadgets and gizmos for those who were underprivileged and disabled - things I didn't quite understand as a child, but knew was amazing. My classmates called him 'the mad scientist man'...but I knew my daddy and I knew he was never mad.
I was six years old and every Friday he would pick me up from school and take me to get ice-cream.
""Daddy,"" I would ask with my big toothy grin. ""Can I have two scoops?""
""How can I ever deny that little face?"" He always asked, squishing my cheeks. I would giggle uncontrollably and when he would hand me the ice cream cone, it'd be loaded with sprinkles. ""Unfortunately,"" He would say. ""This is the only rainbow I can give to you now...but just you wait until I trap one in a box!""
I would nod before digging in and the rest of the time would be spent talking about school and friends and cleaning my face with the promise not to tell mom.
Looking back on it, mom always knew I ate ice-cream before dinner because the dessert that night would be fruit, but it was nice to have a secret between daddy and me.
One Friday, we got ice cream and he said excitedly that he was going to take me to a movie! The animated one that I wanted to see so badly! It probably was just the same as all the rest - I don't really remember it anymore because that night, everything changed.
I'll always remember the bright lights and the sirens...a drunk driver was on the loose and didn't quite care that he was in a crowded parking lot. My daddy pushed me away, but the driver crushed his legs and destroyed his spine. The doctors said he was paralyzed.
For one to live, another must die. I knew this must be true. I'd seen in books, in television, in movies. The order of life was strictly controlled...there was no truly changing anything - only changing the circumstances, only exchanging people.
A great sense of power surged through me as I opened the heavy time machine doors. I wasn't quite sure what he wanted me to do. Change history? It was so broad. It could be from saving Abraham Lincoln to stopping bubblegum from ever existing.
Still - I had to do something. I couldn't leave my father's intelligence to rot in vain. December 9th, 2015...the day my father's body was paralyzed by a drunk driver...I had been right there and yet I had done nothing to stop it. How could I have? I was only 6 years old...he fought his hardest, lasted ten years when the doctors said he only had three...but he still died too soon.
'I could warn him,' I thought. 'Tell him don't cross the road! I see headlights!' or I could push him out of the way. I wasn't quite sure what the plan was when I saw the swerving headlights and my father walking me across the street. My heart jumped out of my chest...and I leaped.
For one to live, another must die.
I saved his life and ended mine.",0

"Manhunt 1-2-3.
*A game that was actually banned in my primary school due to people having a weird idea that it was connected to some murder...thing. Was weird. *
*Basically, it was a game of tic, or as Americans call it, tag, except that anyone you tagged became a Hunter. To make it balanced, you had to hold your finger on someone and say 'Manhunt, 1, 2, 3' clearly and loudly. If they squirmed away then the chase had to continue. In reality, what typically happened is you had one really motivated initial Hunter, but the people he turned tended to be pretty lazy about it. However, it was a fun concept, and me and some friends at the time did expand the rules to include 'safe zones' and 'neutral areas'. I've always felt it could make a good Augmented Reality game if expanded, sort of like a virtual version of the Mirror's Edge setting*
---
The Hunters were everywhere. Of that much, Jack could be certain. However, most typically kept to the rooftops, to get a better view. Only a few Hunters were ever on the ground, being lead by the flocks who stood up above, their phones messaging them with details.
Runners worked much the same, though they typically had more people on the ground.
The only way you could really tell the difference is by the colour of the UI on their phone app.
He flipped open his phone, and his app suggested there was a temporary safe zone ahead, in the coffee shop. Red blips appeared, showing other Runners' location.
Jack grinned, and ran for the location.
He saw his buddy, whose username was Dr_Chronopolis, slamming the keyboard on his blue-lit phone rapidly.
Jack smiled, and tapped the Runner on the shoulder.
""Manhunt. One. Two. Three.""
Dr_Chronopolis' face fell as his screen went red and showed the location of other Hunters.
""...You're a Hunter.""
""Yup. And now, so are you, Doc.""
""How long?""
""About six months.""
""Seriously? You went to that meet-up and all, as a Hunter?""
""It was a safe zone. And I felt it not necessary to advertise.""
""You sneaky bastard!""
""What can I say? I'm finding the Hunter side of the ManhuntAR app way more fun than the Runner side.""
They shook hands, and then went in to have a coffee.
Surrounded by Runners who had no idea that a Hunter team stood amongst them.",0
"I open my eyes in a panic, sweat beading and then falling down my face. I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment. Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before, but there is a heavy, unfamiliar air in the room. I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground, and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink. I was alone last night like I always am, I think. No one has been here but me in over three months.
I'm not allowed to think about it much longer, as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night, slowly worsening. I pinch my eyes shut, knowing what's coming next, and for just one moment, as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break, I think I may just die this time. And just as quickly, the wave reaches the shore, and I know I have a few moments of peace. I open my eyes and look around. I can't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments, and I drift to an uneasy sleep, as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body, dissipating into the small space I call home.
The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it. The pain blinds me, numbing me to all feeling and sensation. The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily.
I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while. I open my eyes and, fighting the blinding lights and white room, I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights. Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I didn't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before, looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to. The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position, only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away.
The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong, though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years. The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders, though they seemed more ashen now. Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me, and I recall the day in my childhood where, in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder, I fell and scrapped my knee. And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position. And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace.
And just as I begin to reach out, I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach. Falling in and out of consciousness, I see quick flashes. I see my mother's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held. I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather, bowing and shaking their heads, unsure. I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance. And I see a sign, sloppily and quickly written above my bed, the only writing visible to me in my haze. It read ""Patient Zero"".",0
"""Em, what's wrong?""
She wouldn't say a word. The portal dissipated behind her, but she stood there, unmoving. If it weren't for the rapid rising and falling of her chest, I'd have thought I was staring at a hallucination, born from the intense longing I'd had for my friend.
Her wide, terrified eyes had scared me at first, but recounting the past four years of her absence let me break through the wall of awkwardness. My eyes welled with tears. She was gone--my best friend since we were in diapers--for four whole years and everyone was convinced she would never come back. How could I *not* immediately want to hug her to death and threaten to never let go? I went over and put my arms up to do just that.
Instead of accepting the embrace and sobbing it out, though, Emily ran out of the room, jumped down the stairs, and left me looking like an idiot with my arms in airplane formation. After some shock, I zoomed after her.
""Hey, Emily, come back!""
I docked myself at the kitchen just as she reached for the fridge. She yanked it open like She-Hulk ripping out a beating heart, nearly taking the handle with her. It was then that I noticed she was really, really angry. Like, the last time she was this pissed was when I stuffed ice cubes down her bra during a sleepover.
""You...""
Finally. That was the first word she said...but it wasn't directed at me. She took something yellow, leafy, and prickly out of the fridge.
A pineapple?
""Go to hell!""
With that, she dropped the unassuming fruit onto the floor and trampled it underfoot. She growled and stomped like a horse possessed. I was lost for words, watching fresh produce being murdered in my kitchen.
""Em, what the fuck are you doing to my food,"" I finally said.
She halted her weird mosh pit and ran over to me. Now her eyes were narrowed and eyebrows arched as she grabbed me by the collar.
""Liz, you've gotta listen to me."" With our faces so close she was practically spitting on me, I had no choice but to listen. She continued. ""I came from the future.""
Slowly, I nodded. I mean, I'd just watched her step out of a portal. How could anything else push my suspension of disbelief further?
""Okay...and what did you see in the future?""
""See this?""
She pointed down at the slushied remains of the pineapple I bought half-price a day earlier, stomping her foot one more time as if to prove a point.
""*These* are our enemies.""
I looked at her. Then to the pineapple. Then back to her.
""Pineapples?""
""Yes.""
""Pineapples are our enemies?""
""Yes.""
""In the future?""
""Yes!""
""But...*pineapples*?""
""Yes! For fuck's sakes, are you gonna make me repeat that all day?""
I wanted to say ""Yes, 'cause no matter how many times you say it, you sound like you just got off the loony bin."" But the fire in her eyes told me to back down.
Seeing that I believed her, Emily grabbed some paper towels and my sponge and thoroughly scrubbed both her feet and the floor free of the tropical debris. She did it vigorously, like she was warding off all remains of Satan's blood or something. I was completely silent the whole time, watching her go through the process.
""It all started with a mutation signal being sent out to all pineapples across the Earth,"" she said after we were seated. ""It caused the enzymes in pineapples to go all haywire. You know how pineapple's really sour?""
""Yeah,"" I said, still unsure of how I should be reacting.
""Well, that's because the juices in pineapples contain enzymes like the ones in our stomachs. So when you eat one, it's also eating you.""
I nodded in understanding.
""Thing is, the mutation strengthened those enzymes about a thousand-fold. Now just touching a slice of pineapple allows the thing to devour you whole. And because of the mutation, the pineapples' metabolism also evolved and allowed them to merge our DNA with their own.""
I thought for a second. ""Wait, you don't mean...""
Emily stared me dead in the eyes. ""It's exactly what you're thinking. They became intelligent, self-aware pineapple humanoids.""
I wanted to laugh at the idea of a fucking pineapple with arms and legs, but the spooky vibe Emily gave it made me shiver instead.
""By the time it was broadcast internationally, it was already too late. The Prickly Ones, as they like to be called, declared war on human civilization. Since they were spread all over the world and all over towns and cities, they quickly won. What remained of humanity fled to the Arctic, since the Prickly Ones hadn't adjusted to such extreme cold yet. But they will eventually.""
My head was spinning. ""This is insane. You said this all started 'cause someone sent out a signal to start the mutation. Who would do that?""
Emily shook her head. ""That isn't important, and it's too late to go searching for them now. After seeing it with my own eyes, I traveled back to the past so I could stop this mess.""
Well, now this was starting to make sense to me. Just a little. ""Oh, really? And what's your plan?""
""We have to inform people right away. Get this info on the news, Twitter, Facebook, I don't care as long as the world can see it. We'll ask everyone to gather up all of the pineapples in their area and dump them into a hole in the ground.""
I scratched my chin curiously. ""Sounds good, but we can't just leave them lying in the ground. What then?""
""We get people to drive their cars into the pineapple stashes.""
""And then?"" I glared at her, wide-eyed.
""And then...""
Emily licked her lips.
""It's smoothie time.""",0
"""I've gotten myself into quite a pickle,"" my client told me, ""So I'm trying to get rid of some loose ends.""
I simply assumed he did some crime, got away, and didn't want his partners to rat him out. I've gotten these kinds of jobs before. Standard. Simple. Kill some poor asshole that got himself into a sticky situation.
Holy shit, was I wrong.
I went to the address disclosed for me. I found myself standing in front of small house, the wooden shutters decaying from time. The stairs on the porch looked like they were about to crumble if I coughed on them. For all I cared, the house could have been a pile of rocks, as long as I still got paid.
The instructions I were given dictated me to knock on the door and follow the person that answered it. So I did. A pale man with a well-tailored suit silently greeted me into the abode. He simply began walking and I followed after closing the door behind me. I was alert, on edge, ready to take on my job.
My instructions went on to detail how the man would lead me into a basement, where I was to receive further orders. I went downstairs. I thought I was prepared for whatever sight would greet me. What I saw then, I still can't explain today. It was just a job.
I found my client. Twice, in fact. At once. I instantly recognized his face from the news; he was a suspect in a bank robbery, and right now, he seemed pretty fucking guilty. He stood in the dingy basement, a huge duffle bag of what I assumed was cash behind him, and next to a chair with a restrained man. The man was an exact copy of him. Spot on, the beard, the hair cut, the small mole on his left cheek.
""Hi,"" the 'him' standing up said, ""I'm sure you have a lot of questions.""
I did, but that was unprofessional. I shook my head in response. I just wanted to get this weird shit over with. ""Good,"" he said, ""I need you to kill me. THIS me!"" He quickly corrected.
He continued, ""Yeah, I'm sure you recognize me. I just pulled off a heist. I needed to be in two places at once, so I made a clone.""
I only thought how.
""I'm pretty scientifically talented,"" he said in reply to my confused expression, ""I want you to kill him. It. Me, whatever the fuck. I'm tying up loose ends.""
""Why would you hire a hit man to do it?"" I asked.
""Look man I'm a bank robber, but not a murderer. Plus he looks just like me! Think you'd be able to do the same? Just do the job and I'll pay you, dude.""
I looked at the clone sitting in the chair, tied up. He looked at me with tired, red eyes. His sorrowful expression. ""Don't do it man,"" he said, ""He's lying. I remember everything in my life. I'm an actual person. *He's* the clone! Have some god damn morals!""
""I'm just doing a job,"" I replied.
""I'll pay you too!"" He shouted back before being silenced by a punch to the face by the standing man.
The two started yelling back and forth. At me. At each other. I zoned out, closed my eyes. I blocked them out and drew my gun.
------
The news was interesting the next day. ""BANK HEIST SUSPECTS FOUND! TWIN BROTHER ALSO INVOLVED! THREE BODIES AT SITE! MONEY NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!"" The headlines read.
I parked my new car at my new house. I still had some junk money left over. It would take a while for the rest to be laundered, but it would last me the rest of my life if I was smart about it. All my loose ends were tied and I covered my tracks. Some other poor bastard would be getting arested for what I did. After all, the event was just a job, and I still got paid in the end.",0
"""What are all those lights, mommy?"" Mercy asked. She held on to her mother's hand.
""Sixty years ago, they were stars. I don't really know what they are now. Most of them are satellites, I think. A few of them are space stations. You see the ones moving over there. The quick ones. They're part of the security grid. They protect us from the Lunarians."" She said, taking a seat in the sand beside her daughter.
""What are Lunarians?"" Mercy asked, squinting one eye closed as she considered the term.
""They're the men and women living on the moon. Two hundred years ago, scientist created cities on the moon to serve as labs."" She explained. ""Now, they want to destroy us.""
""Are they bad people, mommy?"" Mercy asked, staring with wide-eye wonder at the sparkling panoramic view above the sea.
""I want to say yes, but the truth is, they're just scientist. They want to learn. There were us who wanted to stay behind when NASA started colonizing. We want to keep Earth intact. They want to blow it up, and everyone on it.""
""So, they're bad?"" Mercy said, phrasing it as a question, but really just looking for comformation.
""They're bad, baby. They hollowed out the moon. See the moon over there?"" She asked.
""I see it, mommy."" Mercy crowed, pointing a crooked finger at the bright silver orb on the horizon.
""It's not a moon anymore. The Lunarians have turned it into a space station. They made it so it can travel through space. The only problem is, they need to destroy Earth to break it free. The military built the security grid around the planet to protect our satellites and communications from the Lunarians. They can't come home ever again."" She said with a sad smirk.
""Can't they just say they're sorry?"" Mercy asked. Her mother kissed her brow.
""If only it were that easy, sweetheart."" She said. She looked up and felt a dismal dread. She had never wanted to travel into space, but just knowing that grid was there made her feel trapped. Knowing you're in a cage is probably worse then living in one.
""I don't like it, mommy."" Mercy told her with a frown. ""We should all be friends."" She kissed her daughters brow again.
""I love how you think."" She whispered, tickling her daughter to make her smile.
""Look, mommy. A falling star."" Mercy shouted, coming to her feet.
""OH MY GOD!"" Mercy's mother screamed, hugging her daughter in fear. She watched the security grid light up. She watched the flares of exploding rockets on the horizon as the security grid destroyed them, but it wasn't those that filled her with dread. It was the slow streaking arc of the rocket that made it through. The rocket descending toward them.
""Look, Mommy. It's coming over here. Can I catch it?"" Mercy pleaded.
She hugged her daughter close and shielded her from the explosion she knew was about to take place.
""I love you, sweety."" She whispered into her daughter's ear.
""I love you too, m --"" She never got finish.",0

"It *sucks. *
I'm terrified to touch people. Before you ask, no I do not have some kind of mental illness, nor do I have OCD. It's just that I can see more than people think. How it works is that I touch the person in question and I can see their emotional background. I can see what their brain protects itself from. Their dog dying made a huge impact on them. *Whoop. * I see that kind of thing all the time waiting for my subway train.
Sure, some of them are pretty run-of-the-mill things like a pet passing away, a loved one dying, or even the occasional shady dealings with the local loan shark. After a while, it gets easier. Kind of like a filter; the redundant stuff just blurs together.
Then she came.
She was a new client who came into my office the other day requesting some kind of graphics project that ""absolutely had to be done yesterday"" and that ""money was no object, just get it done."" After yelling at my poor secretary Charlene who, bless her heart, put up with her while I got her file all ready for our meeting.
""Mr. Peterson will see you now. Please follow me."" Charlene said curtly. It was painfully obvious that she was fed up with her, from the sound of her voice.
""God, finally. I've been waiting *all day* for this.""
After Charlene opened the door to show her in, I took a quick look at her file that her employer sent me a few hours beforehand and shifted my gaze upwards to meet hers. I would be lying if I didn't say that I was shocked.
She was *beautiful. * Absolutely gorgeous. She was around five feet, six inches. A full five inches shorter than me. She wore a grey cardigan that sufficiently showed her full breast and a nice pair of matching slacks that seemed to follow a smooth, full curve starting from her waist down to the beginning of her thighs. Trying to pull my eyes away, I shifted my eyes upward and saw her face. Her face had perfect proportions. Piercing gray eyes combined with brown hair made her upper half just as pleasing as her lower half.
I gulped: ""Hi, I'm Scott Peterson. I'll be handling your project.""
""Oh it's nice to meet you! I'm Julie. Julie Robson.""
""Thanks for coming in, Julie. Can we discuss your project?""
""By all means.""
We sat down and started a healthy conversation about the project she needed to have done for her boss's convention coming up soon in the city. As we talked, I noticed that I actually liked her. Was this the same woman I heard screeching to poor Charlene just a few hours before? No it couldn't be. The pearly white teeth that flashed each time she made a quick glance in my direction, the hair tied in a tight bun-
""I'm sorry my hair's bothering me. Is it alright with you if I let it down?""
""Sure! I don't mind. At all. Uhh I mean...go ahead."" *Come on don't screw it up. This is a beautiful woman standing three feet away from you! Divert all blood away from the other head! * Julie pulled out a pin and her hair came tumbling down. Oh God, it was like a Pantene commercial. It was almost impossible that a goddess of this caliber would be talking to me.
""Can we continue?"" said Julie.
""Yeah.""
It was around ten o'clock when we finished discussing her project. Both of us were exhausted. I wanted to know when I would see her again, to enjoy her presence. I know it sounds pretty bad, but I fell pretty hard for Julie. She was perfect.
""Are you sure we're all done here? Got all the questions you wanted to ask answered?"" I asked.
She said, ""oh, I still have a few questions. I can wait until tomorrow though. Same time, same place?""
""Of course. You know where I sleep."" I pointed to my office.
She giggled. ""Oh stop. I'm sure you don't work that hard. I am exhausted. I'll talk to you tomorrow!""
She extended her hand for a friendly handshake. Without thinking I reached over and grabbed her hand. It wasn't until her memories came flooding into me that I realized what I had done. I didn't want to ruin my perfect idea of her.
Her memories were pretty standard. The typical upper-class only child upbringing. Well-off parents who spoiled her, but restrained enough to prevent her from going rotten. Memories of high school and heartbreak. College and new experiences. Study abroad.
Then everything went dark. It was just myself. Was this the end of her memories? I heard a screaming and the sound of a news report detailing a grisly murder. Then came the sound of a scalpel cutting through flesh. The screams of someone being tortured for information...or just for the sheer pleasure of his or her captor? During this entire episode, the news report kept getting louder and louder until it all turned into a buzzing white noise that stayed in your head, like a hive of bees in your brain.
More screams. I expected the scalpel cutting noise again. It never came. Instead I heard the revving of a chainsaw. It tore through flesh, tearing away its target's humanity. It reduced a faceless girl to a stump. The same thing happened to countless other people. Trying to block it out, I crouched down, blocked my ears, closed my eyes, and convinced myself it was all just a bad dream.
During this time, I heard something that was being repeated. I had to strain my ears and force my earbones to vibrate at full capacity to make it out.
""Dont'cha love me?"" was what I heard. This phrase was being repeated through the screams, the news reports, the scalpel, the chainsaw...I couldn't deal with it anymore and tried to focus my thoughts, to regain control of my body so I wouldn't have to touch her; to keep seeing these things.
Then, the news report came through loud and clear: ""it has been determined that all of the victims were exposed to one thing in the hours before they were killed. This phrase came in different forms: speech, text, or even a call. If you see this phrase, do not hesitate to contact the local authorities.""
The phrase shown next to the anchor's face was: ""Dont'cha love me?""
At this point, all of the darkness, the screaming, the cutting, the blood, the...everything stopped. I slowly regained control of my body and finished the handshake.
""You ok there, Scott? You look like you've seen some pretty bad shit."" Julie said.
""You have no idea. What time is it?""
""What do you mean? We just finished talking at around ten o'clock at night. It's 10:05PM. You've been here with me the whole time.""
""Did I really just shake your hand for five minutes?"" I said.
""No, silly. The walk down took around four minutes. Anyways, I came up with some really cool ideas to discuss tomorrow! Dont'cha love me?""
*Shit. *",0
"TIFU By...Just read the story...
Firstly, I'm gonna say that this happened at oh, 4am on Christmas. I was half dead from exhaustion, and I think I was beginning to see things. Or, in this case, I was beginning to miss things that would've otherwise been plain as day.
So, as I said, it's 4am. I'm running really low on Christmas cheer at this point, and I still have to do another four states before I can go home and crash. I head down to the next house on my list. Chimney's a snug enough fit, but I manage it. I got inside, no kids asleep on the couch (you wouldn't believe how many times that's happened), cookies (stale and thin, but anything besides the usual diabetes on a plate is fine by me at this point) and milk by the fireplace as expected. Smooth sailing, right?
Wrong.
The first foul-up came when a man I can only assume was the dad came downstairs from his room while I was putting the presents around what I thought at the time was their Christmas tree--in retrospect, the lack of lights and decorations should've been a bit of a red flag. An adult comes downstairs, and we stare at each other for a solid minute. No noise, no movement, if it were a movie you'd think it froze. Then the guy starts screaming and throwing everything he could reach at me, calling me a thief and a burglar and a bunch of other stuff. Now I may be jolly but if you call me a thief, I'm gonna show you exactly how much muscle you can gain hefting a big-ass sack full of random toys around all night.
Then the rest of his family came downstairs, turned on the light...and it turns out I'm wailing on the patriarch of a Jewish family. That crappy tree? A menorah. The crappy cookies? Matzo wafers. I guess the father had gotten himself a midnight snack, which also explains the milk...and I just beat the hell out of him in front of his family. I hightailed it out of there and crossed two states before realizing I left the toy sack back in the house.",0
"It was eight p.m. in DeFrayne's Twenty-Four Hour Laundrette and quiet. The air was warm and snug like an old duvet, the only sound the gentle thrumming of the machines, and old DeFrayne himself was close to falling asleep amongst the boxes of detergent on the counter when the door opened. The cool night air and the rumble of tyres briefly intruded on the cosy scene, and with it came a man.
He seemed quite a shifty man, thought old DeFrayne to himself. Normal laundrettiquette was to walk in, give a friendly smile to the proprietor of the establishment, and busy yourself with your washing. This man was different. He darted in like a magnet might enter a fridge emporium – so quick DeFrayne had barely even seen him. No attempt was made at a friendly smile; instead he skulked round the side of the laundrette in the shadow of the dryers as though desperate not to be noticed. When he came to a gap between the dryers he army-rolled across it.
DeFrayne left his position by the counter and approached the man. He was crouched by one of the washers, fingering the material of some brightly coloured spandex and muttering to himself, apparently quite on edge. He was dressed in what appeared to be a bathrobe.
DeFrayne cleared his throat. ""Can I help you?"" he asked gently.
The man screamed and burst into flames.
""I know you!"" DeFrayne said, three bottles of fire extinguisher and half a bottle of gin later. ""You're whatshisname. Fire Man.""
The man's lips tightened before parting into a winning smile. ""Flame Man,"" he said, ""correct.""
""Ah yes,"" said DeFrayne, looking again at his charred laundrette and reflecting sadly that Fire Men tended to be better at putting out fires than causing them. ""Flame Man."" He put on his best customer-service smile. ""What brings you and your flames to my laundrette?""
""I was hoping to do some laundry,"" said Flame Man. He held up the brightly coloured spandex. ""My suit's a bit, ah, dirty.""
""But of course."" DeFrayne pointed to a set of instructions on the wall. ""Washers are three pounds, dryers are two.""
""It's a bit complicated,"" Flame Man pressed. ""See here…"" He deposited the spandex on the counter and fiddled inside for the label. ""There's this circle… and this circle inside this square… and this picture of a cupcake… and this ‘ B'with a cross over it.""
""Is this blood?"" asked DeFrayne queasily, pointing to a large red stain on the suit.
""No,"" Flame Man admitted. ""It's jam.""
""Ah, that's alright then."" DeFrayne relaxed visibly, and turned his attention to the geometry – and cupcake – that had so baffled Flame Man. ""Let's see… super low heat… only the mildest of detergent…"" His brow furrowed. ""Criminy… how much did this cost you?""
""Got it on the cheap,"" Flame Man said proudly, puffing out his chest beneath his bathrobe.
""I can tell."" DeFrayne rubbed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger and poured himself another gin. ""How can something flameproof require such a delicate wash?""
""Look mate, I'm not Batman,"" Flame Man shot. ""I can't afford all that high quality gear he has knocking about. Can you wash it?""
""I…"" DeFrayne finished his gin. ""Why d'you need it washed anyway?""
""I'm doing a birthday party tomorrow,"" Flame Man said. ""I can't have all the kids thinking I'm covered in blood.""
""A birthday party?"" DeFrayne looked at Flame Man in disbelief. ""I thought you fought crime?""
Flame Man raised his hands in the air. ""Like I said, I'm not Batman. I've got to pay the bills somehow.""
This was too much for DeFrayne. ""No!"" he snapped. ""I'm not spending my entire evening attempting to wash your suit for some girl's birthday party just because you couldn't eat your sandwiches sensibly!""
""It was actually toast,"" Flame Man said haughtily. ""Not my choice."" He eyed DeFrayne sadly. ""Are you saying you won't clean my Super Suit?""
""Yes,"" DeFrayne said coldly. ""That's exactly what I'm saying.""
Flame Man cast an eye over the deserted laundrette, with only the solitary machine thrumming away in the corner. ""Funny,"" he said. ""I would've thought you'd need the business.""
""There's something about nutters setting fire to things that scares customers off,"" said DeFrayne.
Flame Man smiled. ""It was empty before I turned up,"" he said. ""Come on, you've got loads of detergents back there. One of them must be mild enough for my suit.""
""I'm afraid not."" DeFrayne's hand moved from his gin bottle to beneath the counter.
""Must be worth a lot too,"" Flame Man mused, peering over the counter at the back room full of stacked boxes of white washing powder. ""I noticed that was the first thing you did when your little business set on fire was move those boxes from the counter to the back room.""
DeFrayne brought up a gun.
Flame Man smiled. ""My suit washes just fine, thank you,"" he said. ""If you knew anything about laundrettes you'd have seen instantly. They're even on that sign you were so keen to point out to me."" He picked up the suit and held out the label for DeFrayne to see. ""Circle – dry cleanable. Cupcake – machine washable. Circle in a square – tumble dryable.""
DeFrayne's eyes flicked to the sign and back to the suit. ""I don't see no B with no cross over it on my sign,"" he said in an ugly voice.
""Of course,"" Flame Man said. He darted forward and pressed the suit over the gun – just as DeFrayne fired it.
DeFrayne leered at him. ""Guess I'll never find out,"" he said.
Flame Man leaned further over the counter, still clutching the suit over the end of the gun barrel, until his head was right next to DeFrayne's ear.
""Bulletproof,"" he whispered.",0

""I can hear you trying to sneak by.""
For a moment Phil thought he got lucky. His bosses chair was turned around, facing the window. He figured he could tip-toe past his bosses office undetected so he could meet his girlfriend for lunch fifteen minutes early.
""I.. I'm sorry Mr. Crawford."" Phil stammered. Mr. Crawford spun his fully adjustable leather chair around, revealing steepled fingers and a sly, closed-lip smile. Mr. Crawford had been given a nickname for his strict deadlines, unforgiving adherence for reprimand, and the general super-villain-esque way he carried himself around the office. They called him ""Doctor Doom."" Just like the comic book villain. At some point it became abbreviated to just ""Doom.""
Doom sniffed the air and gave a quick glance over Phil's blatantly guilty and unnerved posture. He then stared Phil in the eyes, and his grin got slightly larger.
""That's the same atrocious tie you wore last time you tried to sneak out early.""
Doom spoke with his usual confident and nonfluctuating tone. His mild southern accent would be a great voice for radio, had he not inspired so much conditioned terror in his conversational counterparts.
""Tell me, where is it this time? Banking errand? You want to beat the Friday lunch lines? Hmm...No. Fidgety Phil, you've been working on the Wilson account all morning, a big account NO? Normally your nervous little fingers would have plied patterns in your miserable excuse of an 'Ivy league' crew. But no, your hair is styled, styled like you spent office time fixing it in the washroom, yes? And that smell, you wreak of bathtub cologne, and your Walmart brand shoes are shined for once; tell me, did you tip our poor shoe-shining Joe this morning, or did you stiff him, like you're about to stiff me out of 15 minutes so you can make it your date on time?""
""I.. I was going to stay 15 minutes late at the end of the day s-sir. My girlfriend told me that she was having a rough day, sir."" Phil's put his hands in his pockets and submissively stared at the ground.
""Yes. I'm sure you will stay late tonight...Phil, do you know why your lunch is between 12:00 and 12:30? It's because that is when I need you to take lunch. If I was to have an emergency at 11:50, and our client needed an answer to an important question that only you knew, how would we proceed?""
""You could call my cell-phone, sir.""
""Ah. Of course. So when we call and you say that you need to see the file to answer his question, and you're at the Cactus club, or whatever rube restaurant makes you feel like you're back on in small-town Virginia, you'll come right back I assume? So maybe you pay the waiter and get the food to go, but Friday's are busy, so you're out of there when? 12:03? Then nine minutes return, assuming the elevators aren't busy with the traffic of honest, hard-working employees on their real lunchbreak. Now our client has been waiting 30 minutes for his answer and you have missed your opportunity to pacify your girlfriends fragile sensibilities.""
""I. Well, I just figured I made good progress this morning on the Wilson account I could maybe go do something for my g-""
""**NO**, your progress is circumstantial and your excuses are ad hoc. The pestering little whims that circle through your head have made you their slave Phil. You are a slave to little buzzes of immediate gratification and helping yourself to company time. I see you taking extra coffee breaks and fooling around with Pam at reception when there is still work to be done.""
""And this 'consoling' you will be doing for your girlfriend, that fifteen minutes will help you do it? Or maybe you need the time for something else, maybe you need to visit the bar first, have a little shot for courage?.........Oh don't respond Phil, your employer just accused you of drinking on the job. It's not a secret or anything, your hands have been shaking since you got here this morning, and you spilled your coffee already. Tell me, what else did you spill? Perhaps on one of your frequent bathroom breaks you took one of those tacky little airport liquor bottles, maybe one or three? And your hands, that shake, your nervous little ticks.. I guess you have enough cologne to cover up the smell though, yes?""
Phil's face turned red, and his lips quivered into a painful grimace as he choked back anxious tears. ""I'm.. Sir, please. I need this job.""
""Yes, I know you do. You are 23 and in your first job ever, no? I saw your transcripts, outstanding post-secondary, bravo! But your high school grades were not so great, were they? You didn't get offered a scholarship did you? So Ma and Pa worked their land dead and pinched their pennies so you could go, but it wasn't enough was it? Yale is a pricey school. You had a loan, which put you under considerable debt, didn't you? You couldn't let your parents down and live with the guilt of breaking their bank for nothing, so you studied hard, too hard to party on the weekends, yes? Where does one like you find the time to develop an alcohol problem, hmm Phil?...""
""Sir, I'm. I don't -""
""Yes. I know you don't have a problem Phil. Not an alcohol problem anyway. You just have an anxiety problem...By now I've realized that your mind hasn't been on the job this last little bit, but why? You're ridiculous tie, atypical shoe shine and fanciful hair styling betray your delicate, anxious compulsions, your need for static routine...Today you planned on leaving 15 minutes early for lunch for a total of a 45 minute lunch break, but downtown on a Friday you could easily be held up 30 minutes just waiting for a table. Tell me Phil, she doesn't need consoling, does she? This isn't a spontaneously planned comfort lunch, is it?...Where is your reservation?"" Without breaking eye-contact, Doom's head pointed down slightly and his smile grew, as he stared at Phil in anticipation.
""C-c-c-chez Marko's""
""I see. And that bulge in your pocket. It's an engagement ring, no?...How many months salary did you spend on it? Three? Sure, you spent three-months salary on it. You're a classy grass-roots boy Phil, with a strong compass to familial value. It's probably shaped like her favorite animal, you'd be attracted to a caring type, it's in your bones, Phil. Please, let me see it?""
Dumbfounded by Doom's remarkable accuracy, and afraid for his job, he pulled out the red velvet box and diffidently placed it on the desk.
""Open it boy, I'm not going to touch your girlfriends engagement ring.""
Phil opened the box with his paint-shaker hands.
""Cat's eyes...Yes. I like cats too. You know I am within my power to fire you right now, with all that booze spilled on your shirt. Stealing company time...Do you know what the greatest display of power is Phil?""
""W-wrath sir.""
""No, Phil. Forgiveness. I can ruin your life today. If I fired you right now, how do you think your $150 engagement lunch would go over? You think your ailurophile wants to marry an unemployed debt-ridden farm boy?...""
Phil stared, dumbfounded by the direction this conversation had gone in and Doom's almost clairvoyant insight.
""'Ailurophile', that's a cat lover, Phil. You think your cat loving girlfriend would like it if you were fired?.... So I have your entire life in my hands right now. I can fire you and watch it crumble. Or I can forgive you. That's the trick, I don't even need to fire you. That's how much control I have. You have broken several company policies just today, but I can let it slide without even worrying it's not the right decision. I am absolute power.""
Doom steepled his hands again and paused a few seconds. He then removed his tie and placed it on the table. He then opened his drawer and grabbed a bottle of aged scotch and two glasses, pouring into them.
""Take off that dreadful tie, Phil. This one is Versace. A man must be presentable when meeting his future bride. Skip the bar, take a swig of this. 13 year old scotch. It traveled for 13 years to get here today, the day of your engagement. 13 years. Oh 13 is only bad luck if you have fear, and you just came face-to-face with fear and stood your ground. Don't let the ploy fool you, dear Phil, Doom is not such an apropos moniker for me, though I do enjoy the perception it yields in my staff...""
Phil's hands stopped shaking. He glanced at his watch, 11:51. He still had time to make his date. He downed the drink, and quickly fixed his tie.
""I assume that after your girlfriend says yes, you won't need to spend so much company time confiding with Pam at reception any more? And your excessive coffee breaks will be cut back, since you can focus on work again, yes? Maybe you'll focus so hard you'll impress us one day, earn yourself a little promotion, yes?""
""No. I mean yes. I meant no more wasted time and Yes to hard, err harder work Mist-""
""Don't come back until Monday Phil, take the afternoon off, I'll make sure payroll doesn't dock your salary. Mush along now Phil, you don't want to be late. Mush away."" Doom spun his chair back around so it faced his window. He heard Phil's quick steps bolt out of the room.
""Thankyou Mr. Crawford!""
Doom would enjoy the omniscient perception Phil would have of him thenceforth, even if it was largely due to the two sharing the bathroom while Phil recited his proposal speech in the mirror, thinking he was alone.
Doom looked at his clock. He still had 7 minutes before the lunch break at 12:00. So once again, back turned to his door, he recited,
""I can hear you trying to sneak by."" He waited another thirty seconds.
""I can hear you trying to sneak by.""
""I can hear you trying to sneak by.""

"23/7/2014
Today, something really bad happened! But I'm still sure it's my lucky day. I finally got a job from a newspaper, after my immigration. My supervisor told me if I get any good story I'll get paid handsomely. So I got myself a camera.
Turns out, it wasn't a very good idea to bring a camera on the street. A couple masked guy follows me to the back alley, I pulled my gun, but damn, my gun doesn't shoot. Looks like I shouldn't have bought it from that shady guy in the back alley. I thought I'm doomed.
Then, there's a man in black armor, masked, jumped down from nowhere. He hits those bastard so hard they all fall on the floor in no time. Then he stares at me, I understand what he wants. I threw away my gun, and he looks away. He's so cool he doesn't even have to speak a word. I ask him can I take photos. He didn't answer but I don't need him to, I just took them before he's gone.
I took those photos to my S.V. and he told me good job, it's very rare to have first handed photos so close to this ‘ Batman'guy. He paid me a stash of money. Oh my it's my lucky day.
…

I've been after batman for so many months. Apparently his photos are expensive as hell, and I got a couple of them I could feed myself well. I even got spare money to go out with Elena! She's truly the brightest gem of my life.
I remember how we met a couple months ago when she worked as a waitress in the restaurant 2 streets away. She's so bright I fall in love immediately.
10.26.2015 Sunny
Another score. A couple nice shots of Batman. Man I'm getting good at taking photos, they look so great! I'm sure I'll get good money for these. By the way, he saved me again, this time I was in the bank waiting to withdraw some cash for the spending of the coming week, some thugs bust in and just trying to take everything from everyone. Batman saved the day before they even got their hands on me. Good job, Batman, that's maybe the seventh or eighth times he saved me. Maybe living in this city isn't that dangerous at all!
Tomorrow I'm going to get these photos to my S.V. and I'm going to buy a ring to purpose to Elena. I said it a million times but this time I'm for sure.
10.27.2015 Cloudy
This is a cloudy day, but for me, it's the brightest day in my life.
The pay I got from my S.V. wasn't as good as before. He told me it's the economy and shit. No big deal.
Elena accepted my purpose. I'm the luckiest man in the world. Thank you Elena! Thank you Lord! Thank you Batman!
3.30.2016 Rainy
No. No. No. No. Elena is sick. Really sick. The hospital told me the medicine is very expensive. Our saving is not even close to what I'll need for her. What should I do. No.
I'm not letting her die. The doctor said she got a month before the medication must be in place. I don't know what to do.
4.2.2016 Sunny
There is a… ‘ job offer'from a guy in the back alley. They promise good pay. They said I can sign up before seventh. All I have to do is drive a car, for a certain group in a certain time. I don't know. I might take it, but even if I take it I'm not sure the money they pay will be clean. But Elena, she's getting worse.
4.3.2016 Sunny
Elena won't be happy if I take that job. No, I'm not taking it. She seems to get better than before. She is so beautiful… I can't afford to lost her. I must figure out something.
4.4.2016 Cloudy
The Panama Papers! Just like I thought there must be something in it I can write about! Turns out there is, but not like what I thought. Not politicians. It's Batman. A lot of offshore company clearly indicates where those equipment Batman uses came from, it didn't go anywhere else but straight to his house.
He is Mr. W. How does no one know? It will be big money, and Elena is getting worse again.
But Mr. W, he saved me a couple times, and he saved Elena too. How can I sell him out? I must talk to my S.V.
4.5.2016 Rainy
The moment I tell my supervisor about the story, he closes the curtains of his office. We talk about Batman, mister W., and the situation Elena is. The S.V. told me the identity of Batman Must be kept. I'm partly in relieve. He gives me an amount of money, not enough for Elena, but enough for me to shut up. I thought I was at least a little closer to have enough money for Elena.
But what happens when we finish our discussion, my S.V. open the curtains again! I saw a black figure flashes through. I'm sure it's Batman.
The night I receive a call from the hospital. All the fees Elena needs are paid by some unknown person, and she'll mostly possible to be fine in no time.
The moment I know what I'm doing again. I'm on my knees, crying like a baby.
…
7.12.2016 Cloudy
Two years. It's just two years and so much happened.
Today I went to the hospital with Elena. She's pregnant! I must tell everyone. I'm the luckiest man in the world! And I just got luckier than ever before!
Anyways, does no one in Gotham read those Panama papers? I know Batman might not be a significant figure outside the city, but really, it's pretty clear who he is from what is in the paper...Well, I'm not selling him out anyways.",0
"""Click Me"" submitted just now by ClickMe to /r/pics
It's the only thing on the page. For days, everything has been silent. The world has been void of news, dope memes, and cute animals. You've been alone, sitting in your chair and staring at the screen clicking ""Refresh"" in the hopes that even a subreddit like /r/Terriblefacebookmemes would post something. Alas, only you have logged on and only you have posted anything...But now, there was a post on /r/all! It was terrifying. What if it was some sort of joke? A weird beta error of some sort? You decided it didn't matter- you had to click it. There was no other way.
You clicked the link.
It took you to Imgur, where a single picture resided on the page in front of you. It was a screenshotted satellite map of your neighborhood, and your home was circled. The other houses were each crossed out with a thick black ""X"" and only yours remained clear.
Your palms were sweating, and you gulped as icy fear gripped your spine. Your shaky fingers typed ""What is this? Who are you, OP?"" into the comments.
A moment passed.
OP replied: ""A list...And, I'm a friend.""
""A friend? Of who?"" You typed. ""And what exactly is this a list of.""
Another moment.
""Think of it as a list of potential candidates. None of the other redditors have proved worthy...and you, I'm afraid, are the last one. Now, I suggest you put some pants on, because I am going to be paying you a visit very soon.""
You replied a number of times, but to no avail. It seemed OP, whoever they were, was going to be coming by. You locked all your doors and windows, and crawled to sit by the front door with a knife from the kitchen in your hand. Hours passed, and the silence was driving you insane.
You started to drift.
There was a soft scuffle on the porch, and then a hard knock on the door.
You looked out the peep-hole.
It was Gabe Newell, holding a copy of Half-Life 3.
You sighed, smiled, dropped the knife, and opened the door.
It was just a dream, after all.",0
"""Oh my god, you should have seen it.""
**The Space Time Hobo was telling another story. **
""Listen, one thing you should never, ever do...is give away power based on a number. That's what 'Karma' is...a number. Is someone with more of it a contributor? Yes. Does it mean he or she is, like, a good person? Hell no!
""But here...Well, I wasn't around for the fight, but I met someone who was. Called himself Kaantur-Set...I still don't know how to pronounce that. Anyway, weird little guy, but he told me what he saw.
""And what he saw...was a shattering of society and morals that would shock you. Once again, do NOT give power away based on a silly internet number.
""The big guys with all the karma...they were like superman and stuff, but without any of the morals. There were people who could shoot lasers, people who could vomit copies of themselves, turn other things into explosives...
""It made people crazy. They all went crazy, every one of them. They turned on each other, and themselves, because they couldn't deal with the world anymore.
""One 'Luna', and Kaantur told me this with terror in his eyes, she wrote stories for this...Karma. He remembered walking through a deserted city, and seeing this...shell of a person, writing on the walls with anything she could find. She had run out of paper, and now the city was her story, the never ending tale she couldn't stop writing. When she had no ink, she had to use blood. Her's or otherwise...”
**The Space Time Hobo looked down at the table. **
""Kaantur used 'Reddit' too, but his karma was so low he was still sane. But he will go crazy, he said. He's sure he'll go nuts. And then, and only then, will he be fine dying, and sharing the afterlife with the abomination that his internet kin have become.""",0
"I awake to the sound of my mother and father watching television, having a heated conversation about whats on. ""hey son, get in here and look at this."" my father shouts through the thin walls of my home. ""ugh."" I grunt slowly getting up from my bed and shuffling towards the door. As I walk into the living room i notice they're watching the news. ""The world is in shock as hundreds of thousands of people awoke only to find themselves transformed into.. it seems to be, tattoos."" the anchorman reports. ""Oh my god!"" my mother screams staring out the window with an expression of pure terror. My father and I run towards the window and peer out. Just as the anchorman reported there are people riddled throughout the street, suddenly changed into a tattoo. I look over near the bus stop and see a big bright red heart that has 'Mom' written on it trying to get on the bus, but his arrows are too wide to fit the door. Just past him it looked like a dragon with barbed wire buying a coffee. There is a knock on the door. My mother goes to answer it saying, ""It must be your brother, he just got out of 8am class. As my mother opens the door she lets out the loudest, high pitched scream I've ever heard. Sure enough, there was my brother, a huge sign that said ""Blow Me"" with arrows on both sides pointing down. scratching his head he laughs, ""I guess its about time i told you guys about my tattoo huh?""",0
"It was- though of course, only at first- the worst thing ever. The others, from the shelf- they looked down and wondered- what would happen, if I could get back up somehow, there was a major commotion...at least, at first. I would wager it to have been mere days, no more than three, before it tapered off. The others still shouted down, of course, but I was soon forgotten. And since then.... nothing.
Not that I heard nothing.
That I was nothing.
If the regular brouhaha of the store; the workers' radios KSCH-ing and high-heeled foot falls KLOP KLOP KLOP KLOP, walking down the aisles. Spoil'd kids' anguished cries to their parents, demanding THAT toy TODAY, and then the screaming and the tears and the parents' forced submission- THIS was to be the glorious life of a toy, I wanted nothng of it.
But I'm nothing now.
Merely a forgotten item, lodged behind the yellowing beige metal of the shelves. A stolen toy with no thief. Sometimes, I fancy myself a collector. A collector of dust. And at one point, I'll have more of that than myself.
The workers call this place ""Kay Mart."" I have no idea who Kay is, but if I see him in another time, I'll give him right what he deserves- a solid clock to the cheekbone. All of the toys are made by lowest bidder, and it's obvious. The fur on the plush animals always pulled off in your hand. Plastic mold lines were definite and pronounced. (No wonder the lovely Strawbs across the aisle never gave me more of a passing glance.) We sometimes barely stood up on our own. Children are BRUTAL on their playthings- one of many reasons I despise them- and we are not made for that abuse. We weren't manufactured for any good reason, merely to make someone veerryy thick in the back pocket and keep the irritating hellspawn at bay until dinner was prepared.
When I first fell, I faced up. I'm fairly cerain my eyes are totally shot by now; day after day of staring UP into the bright flourescent lights. I'm sure even Hell will be dimmer.
I woke up to a shudder one night, and I couldn't see what happened until the next day; my box had flipped itself, so now I hung looking DOWN. I'm not sure which is worse, myself.
I can see a leg and an arm on the floor. They used to be attached to me.
The workers here are incompetant as all get-out. The crumbs, etc are just pushed behind the shelf. This rotting grape has been here for what feels like weeks. I'm sure it's alcoholic by now; at minimum fatally poisonous. How I'd like to devour it.
The saddest bit is my story doesn't have an end. I am doomed to spend my days here, looking down, staring at a fuzzy fucking grape.",0

"I still remember. I remember the phone call from Mom. I remember the pain in Dad's voice. I remember my sister falling at the knees, overwhelmed by the devastation one six letter word had caused.
Cancer.
I flash back to these moments every day, reliving every pain filled second, feeling every tear as it runs down my cheek and feeling the raw, unstable emotion within the room. Mom was angry, Dad had ignored her desperate pleas to see a doctor for months. ""How could you?!"" she screamed, ""how could you ignore me! Look what you've done!"". She didn't mean to be angry at him, but she was hurt and upset, we all were. Dad kept saying how sorry he was, reflecting on how his life would be cut so short. He would never get to become a grandparent, he would never get to walk his daughter down the aisle, he would never get to give any more poor ""dadvice"" to his son. I can't even remember how long we all embraced one another for that night. I held my dad in my arms and could already feel his bones. This man was my superhero when I was growing up and now I had to watch him fall apart.
Dad's condition deteriorated quickly, within a matter of months he was gone. The day Dad passed away was one of the hardest of my life. This gaunt, lifeless, shadow of a man lay in a hospital bed barely breathing but still attempted to smile. My Mom and Sister gave us five minutes alone together before it happened. There was an almost awkward atmosphere in the room, we knew what was happening and we knew it was time to say goodbye, but neither of us could acknowledge this. Dad was my best friend, he always had been. Growing up he always referred to me as his best mate and I genuinely believe that I was. He was always there. Every football match, every awards ceremony, every time I needed him he was there and soon he wouldn't be. After a few minutes of talking about the weather and the football we both acknowledged what was happening. Throughout the whole period of illness we'd kept our distance from the reality of the situation, we just acted like Dad was going to be OK, even though we knew he wasn't. ""I'm sorry, Son"", Dad said. ""Looks like we're going to have to take a rain check on that fishing trip, huh?"". I was so hurt I couldn't even find the words to say. I lay next to Dad and put my arms around him and cuddled into him like I was 3 years old again, looking for comfort from him. He hugged back and gently kissed the top of my head. We just lay there, no words, just the loving bond between a father and his son.
Dad passed away whilst I lay in his arms. We never did get round to saying goodbye.
Dad's funeral was held on a Thursday, June 25th. He was buried at the local graveyard, on the family plot next to his parents. It had rained heavily all day, from sunrise to sunset, not that you could see the sun through the thick, dark cloud that encapsulated every inch of the sky. I had to give a speech at the funeral, a reflection of my feelings towards this incredible human being and how this loss will forever impact my family's lives. I remember standing at the podium, shaking. I'd never been good at public speaking and given the circumstances I was not looking forward to delivering this speech. I barely made it through the entire speech. Afterwards I had a piece of music play for my father, a favourite of ours that we'd enjoyed listening to many times and in that moment I felt entirely alone. The church had suddenly emptied, no Priest, no mourners, no Dad. I just sat alone with the memories that Dad and I had created over the years. As the song neared it's end reality kicked back in and I was bought crashing back down to earth.
Clearing out Dad's stuff was surprisingly painful. I'd been preparing for helping Mom clear out his stuff for a few days, mentally I'd tell myself that it was good and I could embrace his memory through his belongings and that holding his memories would bring me comfort. This, however, was not the case. For a few hours I was fine and I'd even had a good laugh at how much junk he had cluttered and collected over the years. The garage was more of an antiques store, only filled with invaluable antiques, stuff that was just old and worthless but for it's sentimental value. Then I found my Dad's old guitar and everything changed. Dad had taught me to play the guitar, despite being somewhat of a novice himself. We'd spend hours making music together playing some of the songs dad was well versed in. To a twelve year old he was a rock star! He picked up that guitar, he roughly tuned it until it sounded ""close enough"" and he had me captivated in his presence. I took a five minute break and started playing some of his favourite songs, pulling some of his famous poses and singing very, very badly. I had a blast and more importantly, I was happy, I was smiling and I was loving every minute of it, until I realised something. I sat down, my joy suddenly turned to sadness. ""I miss him"", I said. Tears filled my eyes and a lump instantly formed in my throat. I was never going to see this man again. I frantically jumped up, ripped open the bags and started putting back his belongings, desperate to leave them exactly as they were. Angry and frustrated, I started thrashing around, like a man possessed, suddenly I had to put everything back in it's place. I wasn't ready to let go, I wasn't ready to remove this man from my life, I hadn't even had the chance to say goodbye and there I was removing his belongings from the family home, from OUR family home. I never did manage to remove anything from the house that day.
Two months later I woke up, it was a normal, sunny day. I went into the kitchen of my apartment, prepared and ate breakfast, watched the news and got dressed ready for work. I was just putting on my tie when my phone rings, I look and see a number I don't recognize. After silently questioning to myself ""who could this be?"" I answer. ""Hello?"" I say rather reservedly. A voice responds, a voice which I recognise instantly, a voice so distinct that I could pick it apart from a thousand others.
""Hi Son, are you still coming over this evening for dinner?""
""Dad?! "", I ask myself. I hang up immediately and start to panic. My chest goes tight, my head goes thick and my thoughts cloudy, my heart races and I feel my adrenaline pump. I'm barely able to pick up the phone my hands are shaking that much. I dial Mom's number, she answers, ""Dad's alive! "", I scream. There's a pause, a silent second that lasts for hours, ""Mom? Did you hear what I said?!"". My tone had sharpened, I demanded a response. ""Son, re you feeling OK?"" Mom asked. ""Dad died, Mom, and now he's alive.. What the hell is going on?! "", ""Son, your Dad's alive because he never died. What are you even saying? Why would you say such things?"". I immediately hang up and run to my room. I tear open a bedside table drawer and rip everything out, searching for the order of service from Dad's funeral which I had kept as a morbid souvenir.

"I'm flooring it across the hills of Los Angeles in my jeep, nervously glancing into my rear view mirror to see if any of the blacked out SUV's are still in pursuit. Fortunately I see only the small dust cloud my off road tires are stirring up behind me. It's been 5 days since ""The Lag"" occurred and the highways are still clogged with people trying to reconnect with their loved ones, leaving the hills as my only viable escape route. Praise be to Zeus for granting me the foresight to purchase an off-road vehicle years ago.
Once most folks began realize that we were experiencing the second greatest phenomena in the history of civilization (the first of course being the 2016 presidential candidates), they thought of the joys of reuniting with friends and family that perished over the three years. However, those hopes were dashed very swiftly. You see, just like the rest of us, the dead ""woke up"" in their exact same place and time they were at three years ago. But with a bit of a twist. All those that had died during the past three years were locked in their exact positions, eyes wide and filled with horror and their mouths agape, every single one emitting the same hellacious, gravelly screeching unwaveringly. ""The Lost"" as the news referred to them would continue doing this until their bodies died once more.
Within the first few minutes I looked out the window to see a 747 smash into the center of Los Angeles. The pilot was one of the lost. Catastrophic events like this occurred all across the world; plane, ship, and car loads of people racing to their deaths with screaming friends or loved ones plunging them into deaths cold embrace. On top of this havoc, the judicial system was practically ruined. All the criminals locked away over the past three years are now running loose. People debating over whether or not they can be tried for something that technically hasn't happened yet and various other topics.
For me, the lag could not have occurred at a worse time. You see, three years ago I was a contract killer for the local crime lords in the Western U.S. One of the best in fact. I was so good that I was able to have a fairly large house in the suburbs and my lovey wife was able to stay home, keep the house in order, and make sure my son kept his grades up. It was a happy time, my family was well supported, we were happy, and I was doing what I loved. I always thought of myself as a sort of artist of my craft, with my rifle serving as my brush. However as with any great artist, there are always critics. One particular crime lord took offense to me giving his brothers living room wall a Kurt Cobain inspired paint job and put a hit on me.
However since the buffoon made it open instead of approaching a professional, I had to deal with a bunch of gun toting savages that thought they were going to make their fortune. Of course these imbeciles managed to spray my home down with some cheap pieces of shit Tec-9's. I wasn't even home. But my wife and son were. Knowing there was no way I could single handedly take on the criminal scum of Los Angeles, I turned myself into the U. S Marshalls. I offered them loads of juicy details on criminal syndicates all over the west and in return was granted amnesty and placed in witness protection.
I had thought the hardest thing I would do in my life was watch my wife and son be buried. That was until the lag happened. I was having breakfast with the two when suddenly they started screeching vehemently at their waffles. At first I was confused, but as it went on the confusion was replaced with fear, and then despair, and finally a sorrowful acceptance as I went upstairs to collect my pistol and put them out of their torment. Burying them the second time was much worse than the first.
Now you may have figured out why I'm fleeing Los Angeles across the hills. Well all those mob bosses I helped take down were very eager for a chance to finally get their vengeance. Unfortunately for me, I see two blacked out SUV's at the bottom of this hill and another coming up behind me now. I pray that The gods at least grant me a warrior's death instead of some twisted bullshit in a butcher shop or whatever other insane shit is hip with psychopathic crime lords these days.",0
"I can see the ambulance. Blue and red lights color the road signaling my doom. What could be about to happen? I'm going at barely 18 miles per hour. Suddenly I see another ambulance behind it. And another. And another. I'm really scared. I see a fire in the distance. I speed up, I need to get away from what ever is about to happen.
The reports say the 31 year old man was trying to exit the town when he crashed with an ambulance responding to the fire. When he crashed, the abulance responding to the crash crashed, and so did the one behind it. So far 178 ambulances have crashed and the numbers are going up. This glitch in the system may mean the end of the vision program.",0
"The Impala's engine throbbed through the streets of Culpepper, Virginia. It was a quaint, sleepy little town in the shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains that had been disturbed by the gruesome murder of a young teenage training to be a lifeguard at the local country club pool.
""Sucked *dry*,"" Sam read from the article, scrunching up his face in disgust at the description. ""And the CPR dummy was nowhere to be found.""
Dean pulled into the parking lot of the motel and turned off the engine. ""So, what? Succubus, you think?""
Sam shrugged. ""The body fits, but why would a succubus steal a CPR dummy? And besides, there's nothing to indicate that the kid had sex before he died. The article probably would have mentioned it if he was found nude and handcuffed to a bed or whatever.""
Dean smirked. ""Yeah, that's the way to go..."" Sam rolled his eyes and got out of the car to go check in.
------
""How'd the FBI get wind of this one?"" the coroner asked as she led the way back to cold storage. Sam and Dean, wearing dapper black suits, tucked their phony IDs back into their breast pockets and followed behind her. ""Isn't this a little outside of your jurisdiction?""
""It's...uhh..."" Dean was always bad at coming up with this kind of stuff.
""Part of a federal investigation into faulty CPR dummies,"" Sam cut in. ""The FDA is concerned that the training devices might be dangerous and asked us to look into it.""
The coroner didn't seem convinced. ""Well it would have to be pretty damn defective to do *this*."" She opened the drawer containing the body and slid it out in a puff of frost. Sam flinched at the sight, but Dean leaned in with a fascinated-yet-disgusted grin. It looked like something you might find in an Egyptian tomb, all shriveled and lifeless. ""Official cause of death was asphyxiation,"" the coroner continued to explain as she handed them all of the information in a little manila envelope. ""But somehow his body was drained of fluids afterwards. The kidneys were shrunk down to the size of green beans! I don't know what kind of defective CPR dummy could do that!""
Sam pulled out a picture of the kid and exchanged a look with Dean. Definitely not a succubus; they tended to go for burly, brawny men. Real specimens of health. This kid was so scrawny that a strong gust of wind might have carried him away.
The coroner's phone began to belt out the refrain from a Justin Bieber song. She blushed and scrambled in her pocket to pick it up before it could continue. Sam and Dean hid their smirks and continued studying the file while she answered the call.
""This is Erin.... oh, hey Sheriff. I was just showing the body of Mi....""
The Winchesters could hear the shouting of the Sheriff on the other end, but couldn't make out what he was saying.
""Wait, *what*?""
....
""He *WHAT*?""
.....
""I'll be right there!""
She hung up the call and turned back to Sam and Dean, who'd of course listened to every word.
""I'm sorry, agents, but I have to go. Sheriff said that somehow one of the local high school kids *impaled himself* on the sword of the Stonewall Jackson statue in town!""
""*Statue*?"" Dean asked. Certainly no coincidence; he would've bet $50 that this victim would be drained and shriveled too.
She nodded. ""I can leave you here with the body if you want...""
""No, we're coming with."" Sam interrupted. ""I've got a feeling that you might need our help here.""

The prompt seemed like the perfect opening to a Supernatural episode so I decided to run with it!",0
"Bridgette's eyes flickered momentarily, but only back and forth across the glowing rectangular screen clutched in her pinkly glittering fingertips. ""Yeah man, people fucking love you. You're, like, pretty much pop-culture.""
The Prince of Darkness snapped his leathery wings in irritation. Bridgette didn't look up; her followers needed her. The perfectly crisp white line of the part in her hair stared up at him as she calmly strung puns in a never-ending comment chain like a fucking pro. Lucifer the Morningstar settled for crouching a little in an attempt to make eye-contact, his barbed tails sweeping the ground. ""Believe me, I understand the temptation, but this has to stop. I'm not the Santa Claus of Reddit, I can't be everywhere at once.""
Bridgette's gaze flicked onto him so unexpectedly that Satan noticed too late the picture she snapped of him. ""Yeah, that's a meme if I ever heard one.""
Beelzebub peeked over her shoulder as blocky white text appeared across the scorching image of his sullen face. Between fangs, he pouted. ""Even you have to admit it's a cheap shot.""
Suddenly she was next to him, her spine pressed lightly into the burning flesh of his naked chest. The small white screen floated before his eyes between her palms. ""There, you see that? That's my fucking karma, big boy.""
Suddenly Satan didn't know what to do with hands. ""Is that for real?""
""Just from this post. I'm telling you, they fucking love you."" She smiled sweetly, looked up into his face, and snapped a selfie.
The Lord of the Flies stared blankly at the girl in his arms, then seemed to finally find his tongue. ""I think my eyes were closed. Get another.""",0
"""Dear God, make it stop.""
A mumble, a rumble. It's quiet and soft somewhere down the endless lines of clones.
He can't tell which one is defective this time but he goes down the line slowly anyway, pretending he doesn't notice the clone that is just a little too tall, a little too tanned to be normal.
Normal. Ha.
He checks off everything on his checkboard. He walks away, pretending he doesn't see any flaw in the line of clones.
There are...more errors everyday. The clones are no longer as standardized as they once were, back when the gene feeds were pure. There are more errors as something in the Sentience Matrix machine gets more twisted.
""Dear-""
He doesn't watch as a robot leaps down from the ceiling, swallowing the clone in an instant. The robot lands on the floor, head swivelling around for a moment to assess the clones around it. It stands in a patch of dark liquid.
He looks away.
He looks away, because that could have been him, instead of a clone.
He has to do what the robots want though. It's better like that, when they have more humans to harvest. Humans that aren't...real people. Just clones.
He tries to ignore the odour of rust in the air as the next batch of clones trudges into the chamber.",0
"Stanley walked up the stairs to his boss' office.
Stanley knowing a shorter path went into the elevator and pressed the button 3, to his bosses office.
Stanley walked into his boss' office as soon as the door opened.
No, that can't be right, Stanley, you can't just plug in the vacuum cleaner, that's not in the script.
What's that I hear, you're a real person?
Well then, let me show you a video on obedience.
Oh, let's see everything in this elevator is broken.
However, all hope is not lost, now just walk to the boss' office!
Oh, you refuse, well now look, this entire thing is broken, all my hours of work, destroyed by you, you careless jerk.
I guess I can only delete this project of mine.
Goodbye, Stanley.",0
"I sighed a deep sigh, but it didn't relieve the tension in the room or in my body. I hated the fact that the boss wanted us to do this, but I hated even more that my partner was fully on board. The fight started slowly. I obviously didn't want anything to do with him having seen all of the carnage that he was causing above, but my partner felt it was his solemn duty to carry out every order to the tee, or some garbage like that.
""Have you not been paying attention at all? "", i bellowed at him in front of everyone, barely getting a reaction out of him.
""Yeah, but...""
""But what? Have you noticed how many people he and his cohorts have sent down here? Have you seen the relief in their faces when they realize they were *here*? Why the *hell* would someone be relieved to be here? Maybe it's because the hell he's been putting on up there is heaven compared to the shit they'll have to go through down here.""
""But what about our duty? "", he asked calmly.
""What about his? "", I retorted. ""Wasn't he elected to lead his people out of one of their darkest times? And what did he do instead huh? *What the hell did he do?! *""
""That's not importa...""
""You're damn right it's important! Why should we protect him when he failed to protect anyone up there? Why should we help him when he made a life out of destroying so many? "", I said calming down a little bit. ""Why should we help him when even those in his inner circle wound up down here by his own hand long before their time was up?""
""He's here. "", the assistant said.
""I'm not going. "", I said as I sat back down. ""You may have your duty, but I still have my morals.""",0
"I woke up with a blinding headache
""He's waking up, quick get him back under""
Words cut through the vicious ringing in my ears and fade back into soft
silence and comforting darkness
...
Darkness fades back into cognition, my cheek itches and as I reach to scratch it my hand is bitten by something. Wait, not bitten, bound. Eyes flying open, pupils constricting expecting light; I cry out when the pain of its absence fills flares in my skull. Why does the darkness hurt? I try to roll over but the bindings bite in deeper, why cant I move? Trying to rise I find my feet bound as well.
""He's back at it, thrashing around""
A rustling by my side and the ground falls away as a deeper blackness envelops me
...
Coming to a white light cuts through my optical nerves straight to the back of my skull. A scream rips itself from dry, cracked lips.
""welcome back to the world of the living""
A familiar voice drawls. Eric, 23, single, neighbor, best friend since middle school.
""Damn, he looks rough""
Sam, 21, probably fucking Eric, classmate, study partners since last semester.
""Hey man, you thirsty? Eric, get him some water""
Ty, 23, player, pen pal, haven't seen him since he moved four years ago.
Footsteps recede, Eric, getting me water from god knows where. As the sound fades a memory takes form
""Can't believe that"" ringing fills my ears ""tried to kill him"" more ringing, fading in and out ""but these two have been here every day trying to wake him up"" ringing and then a different voice
""Let them all stay, it will settle itself""
When was that? A week ago? A year? Who tried to kill me?
I try to open my eyes again, but the blinding lights force them closed again.
""Ty"" I manage to shove the mangled word through bloody lips before a cough racks my body, sending pain through every nerve.
""Calm down there cowboy""
I can hear Sam's smile through her words, the same she uses every time I start to get ahead of myself.
""Hey man, chill""
Eric is back
""Open your mouth""
I oblige and cool water flows over my lips and chin, into my nose but most importantly my mouth.
The flow trickles to an end
""More"" I plead
""Nope, they said only one of those every hour, but I think 45 minutes will be just fine"" Eric says conspiratorially
""Don't want to hurt yourself there champ""
Sam again. Why are they all here?
""*The rule of three here still abides, two friends by your side a third hand does poison hide two with life to bequeath, third with steel to unsheathe*""
Who is that voice? Should I tell her what I've wanted to for these last long weeks. Can I get it out? I can try...
""Sam"" A cough rips through my lungs
""Who?"" Ty asks
""Sam, come here"" I repeat, swallowing the next spasm before it can start
""Hey man, are you ok? Its just us""
""Yeah, you me and Ty"" Eric interjects
""They must have you on some strong shit""
Ty chuckles nervously in agreement.
""But Sam, I can here her"" I struggle through the sentence, words coming easier now.
""Do you know where you are?"" asks Eric
Racking my brain to no avail I finally give in and admit ""no""
""The hospital man, you've been here for weeks.""
Cold dread fills my body, and I force myself to open my eyes, the cold white fades to a warmer yellow and my two friends faces swim into view with a hard white background.
""Why""
A quiet rustling as my two friends try to put the last few weeks into words.
Ty responds quietly ""Your tried to kill yourself man""

"""How does defeat taste, power rangers? I hope it suits your palate--once the green candle burns out, you will never get him back!"" Rita Repulsa's laughter crackles as the projection shuts down. Tommy feels the shackles holding him back but his mind is focused on the small green flame that dances before him.
Rita takes off her headdress and leans back in her chair. ""Finally. I wasn't sure if my throat could hold out much longer."" One of her minions runs up with a cup of steaming liquid, taking the headwear from her. ""Thank you.""
""You won't get away with this, you witch!"" Tommy shouts in confused desperation.
Rita slowly swivels to face him. ""Brian, don't- wait was it Josh? Joshua? No matter. Please quiet down."" She begins to swivel back.
""You may have fooled me once before, but now I know the truth! The power rangers will stop-""
""The truth?"" Rita smiles, her gentle laugh quickly transitioning to a hearty cough. ""Ouch. I guess the truth hurts."" A few more painful chuckles followed by a deep sip.
""What's wrong with you? Why are you so… so relaxed?"" A brief silence permeates. ""What do you have up your baggy sleeve, Repulsa?""
""Please, Rita. Or Taijanna, if you prefer."" Another sip. ""Full of questions today, aren't we? Too bad they're all the wrong ones.""
""What do you want?""
She swivels toward him again. ""There we go. It's pretty simple. We need help.""
It's Tommy's turn to let out a pathetic laugh. ""Help? As in, helping you hurt my friends and commit genocide on my people?""
""You wouldn't be the first human to do so. But no matter, you're not a player anymore.""
""My friends will save me!""
""From what? This?"" Rita walks over to the candle and snuffs it out. ""My dear, your powers have already been revoked. Galaxies, I didn't even need to bring you here for that.""
""You're lying!""
Rita taps a button on her chair, and Tommy's restrains loosen. ""Go ahead.""
Tommy pushes his communicator in a familiar way but nothing happens. ""How could- how did you do this?""
""It's not hard to turn off our own technology remotely.""
""No, Zordon-""
""Is the wizard of Ooze. Uzi. Urzi?"" Rita sighs, ""A fraud.""
""I don't believe you! Zordon would never lie to us!""
""Ten minutes ago you wholeheartedly believed that gigantic fighting machines were eons old and native to Earth because we shaped them like dinosaurs. No, I'm not overly worried about your beliefs."" Rita swivels back as a minion appears with a lapdesk and several handhelds.
""You're not making sense!""
""What are you babbling about? Why else would I be here?""
""You're trying to take over the planet… to rule the galaxy.""
""My my. That's right. Among all the stars in the galaxy, I happened to chose a planet that can apparently best me in combat time and time again. At this rate my empire might expand to half a dozen worthless planets in my lifetime! What unbridled glory!"" Rita passes a tablet to a nearby minion. ""Chickling, I, or any spacefarer for that matter, could destroy your sun with less effort than a sneeze. Or if I wanted your dustball, a host of species-targeted biological weapons. No, we are here for you. Well not you. You've played your part.""
""If you want our help, why are you attacking us?""
Rita puts down her implements and looks at Tommy directly. ""We are not attacking you. I send down one lumbering lifeform to a sparsely populated area, and provide you with excessive force to defeat it. I could easily flood your world with countless such creatures, even if your paranoia would likely result in a cluster of mushroom clouds."" Rita focuses on her devices again. ""Although even a single one results in hundreds of forms requiring approval. Still, so long as we fight, our so-called allies won't be allowed to interfere. Squatters rights and all that."" Rita pauses, ""Or maybe a filibuster would be a closer analogy. I really wasn't given adequate time to study this world.""
""It doesn't add up! Why the charade?"" Tommy's exasperation seeps in, ""If you're so powerful, why do you need our help?""
""Didn't you ever wonder why we force you to dress in silly costumes and keep your identities secret? It's all about continuity with you humans."" Rita starts to tear up, ""By the time we are done, there will have been innumerable red and blue rangers, and no one will remember the names.""
""I don't get it,"" Tommy retorts as he resumes a defensive stance.
""After a thousand generations of unmitigated human victories, your species might have the confidence to learn the reason without committing collective suicide. If we even last that long."" Rita puts her lapdesk on the floor and notices the determination glittering in Tommy's eyes. ""Still… these early years are crucial. A single outlier could cut that time in half, and that could make all the difference. Are you that one, Joshua?""",0
"UNCLE SAM WANTS YOU
...to stop going back in time
and poking Julius Caesar with plastic knives
HE DOES NOT LIKE IT
Barry squinted at the poster pasted on the brick wall. Uncle Sam looked a bit feral in it. His eyes were wild and red rimmed, as though the very thought of someone poking Caesar with plastic knives was keeping him up at night.
""Kids ruin everything"", he muttered.
Some genius had invented a portable time machine twenty years or so ago. He'd uploaded his schematics to the internet and now everyone had one or could have one if they wanted to.
No one changed the future or anything. Apparently that was impossible. Anything you fucked up in the past eventually fixed itself. Barry had listened to a guy on TV explain it once. He'd said time was like silly putty. You could mold it however you wanted but the slimy stuff desired to be whole. Time wanted to be a series of fixed points.
Nothing you brought back with you stayed. Barry knew a guy who'd stolen a chest full of gold from some old pirate ship. It disappeared as soon as the guy had come back. Now that same guy had lost an eye to the pirate king and that stayed gone. Though Barry didn't think he looked that bad in an eye patch.
The problems came, then, from the machines themselves. Some people came back wrong. They carved symbols into their skin, blathering about the coming storm. Some people just died. They crossed the wrong wires when building their machine or went to the wrong time or date or any number of similar things. The streets were littered with missing posters.
The government wasn't too concerned about time travel mishaps. What they were concerned about was taxes. President Kilborn had managed to pass a law which patented the time machine design several years ago. Anyone who used or downloaded the design must pay taxes. Such a thing was, of course, hard to keep track of. So the Agency was born, to collect on these debts.
Barry joined up half a dozen years ago. It wasn't what he'd thought it would be. Mostly a lot of skulking. Peeping. Listening. Occasionally moments of brief terror. Tonight he was supposed to go bust a kid for unauthorized time travel. The kid had gone back to regency England and started flipping women's skirts up. Barry had listened as he told his friend over the phone that the bustles made them like turtles. A room full of turtles, he'd laughed.
Barry stuffed his hands in his pockets, waiting. His partner stumbled out of the bar, clutching a woman in either arm.
""Phil? You forget we had a bust tonight?""
Phil looked out blearily from under a red fedora. He'd gotten into old black and white films recently and wore a suit everywhere. He wasn't alone. Most found a time period they liked and dressed that way. Powdered wigs and neon and gingham dresses. It was enough to give any man a raging headache.
""But my dolls needed refreshment! Would you deny my dolls, Barry? Would you?"" Phil slurred. Barry realized the women were all that was holding him up.
""Just take him home. I'll go it alone. It's just one kid"", Barry said. He walked away in disgust as Phil kept asking the girls what happened.
The kid lived a few blocks away in his parent's basement. Barry had spied through the window a couple of times. He hadn't seen much. Kid ate too much junk food and played VR constantly. Tonight, the windows were dark.
Barry peeked in, spotting a lone green light. The time travel device had a light like that. It flared up when in use and broke after one trip. They weren't very efficient to use or make.
Barry clutched his tazer and opened the window, wiggling in with room to spare. He usually hated his long bony frame but it did come in handy sometimes.
""Put your hands up!"" he yelled into the darkness.
""Oh shit!""
""Lights! 100 percent!"" Barry yelled.
The lights came on, near blinding him. In the middle of the room stood the kid. He was dressed. Well, Barry didn't know what he was dressed as. He wore a huge bell shaped skirt. And a corset? That bone looking thing around his waist really looked like a corset.
""I can explain, officer"", the kid said.
Barry closed his eyes. ""How about I come back tomorrow and arrest you? You can't go to jail wearing bloomers, for Christ's sake. Well, you could but you wouldn't like it.""
The kid bit his lip. ""I just wanted to see what it felt like. The way they moved....""
Barry held up his hand. He left, going up the stairs past the kid's parents who never looked up from their holotv. He headed back towards the bar where he'd left Phil, wondering if there was any whisky left in the place.",0
"Tough.
Male, obviously. Aggressive, above average testosterone levels. Quick metabolism...risky, because with poverty it would increase my chances to starve. Low potential for addiction, that would be somewhere in the frontal lobe I think. The guide for this thing was ridiculously long.
Resilient.
Being too smart didn't work out the last time. It's all good fun if you have the right circumstances, but it really sucks when you have people like *him* around. You internalize abuse too well that way. Never again. I'll have the potential there, but this time I'll need to work for it.
Hidden.
Slightly above average height. Brown eyes, black hair. Slim, but not lanky. Regular physical development. Unremarkable face. Slightly under average amount of body hair. Able to blend in anywhere. So they wouldn't drag me back to a place I didn't want.
Observant.
Slight depressive tendencies. Depression allows people to view things with less fallacies tainting the picture. Sharp hearing and eyesight. Good hand-eye coordination. When I'll be trapped, it won't stop me from getting around. Even if there would be no light, like the basement.
Manipulative.
Sociopathic tendencies. I need to be a liar. If I use people, they can't use me. Not again. Not ever.
Next I added some slightly crooked teeth. No use getting a swollen ego. A smaller than average nose, harder to break. Long fingers. Muscles built for sprinting more than a long run. If I need to run, it'll probably be fast.
I looked in the mirror, and saw the gaping hole in my neck. The temptation to make myself handsome, brilliant, well-rounded...it was a pipe dream. Only those born in the right place and the right time can afford to stand out like that. Never had that luck myself. But this time, I'll be able to fight it out...and become just slightly above average in the end. No gambling here.
I made sure my hair would be dry. With these features, I want to be able to make myself presentable with little effort. In the last moment, I decided that perhaps green eyes would be worth it. Just one small hint of a memory I'll soon forget. After all, with no kids of my own, I think that I earned this little mercy. The little dunderhead I'm gonna be should carry around a little memory, even if he will never know it.",0
"My name is Michael Webb. My mission: retrieve lost artifacts from the bottom of the sea. In particular, the bottom of the sea in the area of the Atlantic we now know to have been the lost city.
As it turns out, Atlantis was a real place, and their technology was unbelievably advanced for its time. Of course, there have been crazy conspiracies about aliens and such, but from what my archaeological team has been telling me, it seems like they were nothing more than an advanced civilization with an isolationist culture. Most of their technology has been worn down by the sea to the point where it simply doesn't work anymore, though a few pieces of medical equipment have been invaluable to the folks back home, leading the cures for all kinds of formerly-terminal diseases.
The most interesting piece we've found so far, however, has been a strange trident, reminiscent of the Greek God Poseiden. I know, I know, it's just a myth. We know today that there were no Greek Gods, but let me remind you that until just thirty years ago, we knew there was no such city as Atlantis. I've been told that our research team has discovered what appears to be logical circuits running along the inside of the trident via x-ray technologies. So far, however, every attempt to supply and electrical current to the thing has failed.
Oh, well, I'm more interested in what we'll find next down here; I live for adventure, not scientific discovery. Unfortunately, even my small one-man pod is incapable of exploring very far into the city, as it wont fit through the small doors into buildings, and we haven't yet developed anything smaller which can keep a man alive at these depths. It's an architectural marvel these structures survive the crushing weight of the ocean above them, and for some many thousands of years at that.
As I pilot the craft too closely around a corner, some sensors start screaming at me, and I make a *huge* rookie mistake. I bump into another petrified remains of one of the citizens. We've been finding these guys all over the place: I'm not sure why. They almost appear to be solid stone, perfectly preserved statues of the actual citizens of Atlantis, much like the guys encased in solid rock in Pompeii after the eruption of Vesuvius. What was weird about these was that they were under water, and none of the egg-heads back at the main sub could figure out why they were preserved in the same way.
Well, as I crash right through him, he crumbles to bits. I remain, fortunately, unharmed, but I know better than to go around destroying valuable artifacts for the guys to study. When the dust settles and I gain control over my pod again, I notice something falling more slowly than the rest of the wreckage (or should I say pieces of body). It appears to be some sort of crown, but not ornamental, more elegant, slender, like a tiara. I use the grasping on my arms to scoop it up and take it back to the main sub.
I decide it would be a funny prank to walk in wearing this silly little thing, so I put it on my head and, once the pressure equalization sequence is complete, I board the main sub, strutting in front of Tim, the head egg-head. ""Ha ha, very funny."" Tim says. ""Actually, that thing looks like a pretty important artifact to study. Let me see it.""
""Sure thing"" I say as I remove the tiara. At least, I'm trying to remove it, but it refuses to come off. It's like the thing is fused to my forehead. ""Help me, Tim, it's stuck.""
""Quite joking, Mike. Take it off.""
""No, really, Tim. It's stuck.""
Time attempts to remove the tiara, but has just as much luck as I do. ""Weird."" He says. ""Maybe it dried out and shrank during the pressure equalization process. Let's get to the lab.""
My gaze is immediately drawn to the trident as we enter the lab. I don't know why, but I feel an instinctual compulsion to hold it, as though my life depended on it. I suppress this feeling, though; I don't want to boys worrying about their captain.
After a few hours of trying everything they could think of, the boys decide that we might as well just call it a day. The crown doesn't seem to be harming me in any way, and everything about my vitals seems to be normal. I agree, and everyone but Tim leaves the lab. ""You coming?"" He asks me.
""I'll leave soon enough. I want to try soaking it one more time to see if it will come off."" It's a lie; by now I'm aware that water isn't going to take this thing off of my head, but I just need to be alone with that trident, just so I can hold it for a moment.
""Okay,"" he says. ""Don't stay up too late. We'll be heading back to the surface to resupply tomorrow.""
""I know"" I say as he leaves, shutting the door behind him. I quickly bound across the room, grasping the trident firmly in my hands. As I marvel at its construction, the most unexpected thing happens: it fires a bolt of energy, a large one, right at the exterior wall.
Before I know whats happening, the undertow is dragging me out into the ocean. The trident slips from my grasp, falling away from the sub. This is it. I'm going to die. Any second now.
But seconds turn into minutes, and I live on. Somehow I'm not being crushed by the massive pressure of the depths, nor is my body temperature dropping rapidly in the nearly-freezing water. I'm nearing the edge of my lung capacity. Surely this will kill me, if nothing else, I'll drown. I open my mouth and breathe in the salty ocean water, and… I'm fine? How is it that I'm not drowning? There's no other explanation: I'm either dreaming, or this crown is much, much more than meets the eye.
I swim toward the trident. As I hold my hand out to it, it races toward me, coming to rest naturally in my hand. Instinctively, I hold it out in front of me, and it pulls me forward like a motorized dolphin scooter; I'm able to direct it just as easily as one.
I swim up to the periscope, tapping on it with my finger. They flick the light on, as if in response to detecting something. I find that I can fog the lens by breathing on it, and I can write about three letters at a time. I sure hope they're taking notes.
It takes a while, but I explain everything through writing letters on the periscope lens. Then I tell them: ""I'm going to explore the ruins. Surface without me. I'll meet you up there tomorrow."" Somehow, I know this thing will take me all the way to the top of the sea.
I swim to the most interesting building I could remember. We had determined that it either served as a kind of governmental building, or a central place of religion. I bring myself down to stand before the large doors and pull them open, something our subs had been unable to do, and I enter the ruins.

"Did our Words doom us to failure? Or was it just me?
Alice had hoped never to meet her soul mate. She met me through some godawful fucking boring work thing, and she caught my eye from across the room. Her Words started tucked up behind her left ear, and plunged into her neckline, tantalizingly low but not enough to finish them. ""I'm much happi --""
We only had to talk for an hour before I knew we were going to make up an excuse to leave together. It was early enough in the evening that we could find a diner or bar. We chose a Denny's nearer to my house than hers. It was the first place we ever told a consequence-free lie together, to our waitress.
We both loved lies like those. She would tell clients at work she'd never see again that her father owned a rhubarb farm in New Mexico. I think she fell in love with me the more details I added to her dumb lie. ""Emus are a real pain for a professional rhubarb farmer."" ""Rhubarb is the best-selling produce in Tesuque."" ""Cormac McCarthy basically wrote Blood Meridian on dad's farm."" Consequence free.
At Denny's is when she told me she never wanted to meet her soul mate. After Denny's is when I found out why.
Her shirt came off and I guess I'm a nerd because even with a pair of breasts in front of me I had to read the words. ""I'm much happier without you."" I'd known her a night and already the thought was mind-boggling to me. Over the next several months it only became more so. Alice was light, she was funny, she made fun of me because my Words are right in tramp stamp territory. We were an argument against pre-determination. We fell in love and knew each other so well. It was impossible that we could ever say our Words to each other. But there was no doubt we were soul mates.
But neither of us had ever met someone who escaped their Words. And that's where the fear came in. What could make me say that to her? Would she cheat on me? Murder my family? Surely if I ever said those words to her, the reason would be monumental. But everything was so perfect. The only monuments could be to how well we'd woven together.
But I was afraid, and my fear made her afraid. She never buckled. I started drinking.
We still told lies to strangers, I still told them about how my second cousin invented velcro while she stifled laughter which she'd let loose when we were alone. Her laugh was huge and unabashed for such a small girl. But there were other lies too. My lies about how late I was gonna be out, her lies about how happy she still was.
The end of us came so many times. It wasn't an inevitable whirlpool we were being sucked into. Our heads bobbed under the water so many times but we came back up. But eventually she had to be done with me. I couldn't blame her. I was insufferable.
The really bad moment, the real end of it all, came months after. I would call her sometimes, drunk, trying not to wake up whoever was in bed beside me. I caught a little timeline of her life after me, the mourning, the new boyfriend, the weird updates to her family's affairs she couldn't help but tell me even though I was sloshed.
The last phone call *was* inevitable. It was like I'd tied her up on the railroad tracks and was determined to barrel over her. We talked, I was so bitter, I was spitting every word by the end. I wanted to hurt her. I wanted her to know I was her soul mate and she'd lost everything when she left me. So I said it, sickened by myself. ""I'm much happier without you."" She was crying, I could tell she was, when she asked, ""Is that how you really want this to go?"" She was trying to trick me into more words, trying to avoid the truth, but I stayed silent. So she said my Words, disappointed and crying but somehow resolute. ""Please just...don't call me again.""
We were both quiet for a few minutes and when she hung up I laid down with a hole in my stomach. Some lies aren't consequence free.",0
"**The Zombie apocalypse arrived. The zombies live forever, don't care about social rules, sleep around a lot and generally have more fun. People are rushing to become zombies. **
I'll never forget what it felt like getting bit for the first time. It really fucking hurt.
My knee-jerk response was to punch him in the face as hard as I could. ""The fuck you do that for, Jeff?"" My shoulder throbbed. Drowning Pool's 'Bodies' resonated throughout the house. It wasn't funny at the time, but the memory of it will always strike me as particularly amusing. As if someone had decided to make my first experience picture perfect.
The weeks and months following were a blur of drug-induced debauchery. I lived to party. More than ever before, I sought the attention of my peers, disregarded authority, ignored the media, and lay waste to my surroundings. And it. Was. Awesome. Seriously, I had the time of my life. Or death, really. I suppose it depends on your perspective.
You see, what I didn't understand yet was that my *life* had ended. It ended hours after I got bit for the first time. For fuck's sake Jeff, you could have warned me. Anyone could have. But I suppose that's the bitter irony of my circumstances. I became so immediately wrapped up in the party of today that I failed to acknowledge the signs sprouting up around me. And now, two years later, civilization has all but collapsed around me. Where was I?
With everyone else. Ignoring the urge to eat, except for the few times I tried to gnaw on a friend. Going to town on whoever looked alright - did I tell you that's probably the weirdest part? Sexual orientation just sort of stopped mattering. I'm not even bothered by it.
I had no idea that I belonged to a new group of radicalized societal outcasts that partied the country into the ground while the rest of America watched in horror. And now I'm part of the obscene, one of the wanderers forced to the fringe while the normals hide out in their powered strongholds and warmed houses. Many of us have already committed suicide. Out of boredom, more than anything. Not *needing* anything was so much fun at first, but eventually just sapped us of humanity.
Every once in awhile I'll catch a glimpse of a television, somehow connected to cable still. The news outlets broadcasting from their various bastions always have some sort of breakthrough discovery about the disease. Last month, the big headline was that its effects were purely cerebral. As in, all it did was flip a switch to make us think differently. That somehow, through all the drugs and alcohol we'd still been consuming enough calories to subsist. Oh, and yeah. **Immortality is still a myth. **
Hell of a hangover.
At least I'll always have the comfort of not caring. Unfortunately, that wasn't true either. I just found out today. The bug kills itself off over the course of just a few years.
I wonder if they'll take me back?",0
"These days never get easier. Actually, the days I like, that's when I get to rest. It's when the sun goes down that things start to bother me.
You see that kid above me? Cute kid, good with his parents, and never causes any problems. I've seen him outgrow his crib and move into this racecar bed with flames down the side. It's a good upgrade from the cramped space under the crib, let me tell ya. I haven't seen the kid much outside of this room; the truth is I'm not allowed anywhere else. Boss's rules, not his. I don't mind though, the view is good and I can hear everything in this small house which makes me feel like I'm part of the family.
I like to think he turned out alright since he gets such good rest at night, but I wouldn't want to take too much credit. To be honest, I've never actually met the kid. When he first moved into the new bed, his father was in here just before the lights went out. For what seemed like months the father would come in and listen to the boy talk about his fear of me, the Boogeyman. He would come in and say:
""Taylor, buddy it's alright. The lights go out, but everything is fine.""
To which the boy would say ""But dad I know he's in here"".
""It's just your mind playing games with you. I knew we shouldn't have let you watch the movies with mom and I last Halloween."" The dad said jokingly with a smile on his face.
Taylor didn't want his dad to think he wasn't ready to be a big boy so he shouted
""No way dad, I can handle anything!""
""Okay then bud, sleep well. Remember it's just like any other night."" The dad said as he turned out the lights and shut the door behind him.
Maybe another night for you Taylor, but I'll be busy.
I mean, how this kid can be scared of me when we've never met!
I've tried to come out and say hi a few times before, but every time this kid hears the slightest noise I can sense he gets worried. So I stick down here and haven't moved since. Not that I get much spare time to even come out, but one day would be nice.
You see, where I'm from is a rough part of town. It's not your ordinary town with the kids playing out front of their homes with white picket fences. As a matter of fact, no one in Taylor's world knows my world even exists. Sure, everyone around seems to get along, but at night the real creeps come out. These guys like to cause problems and they can do that to each other. I wish they would keep it amongst the other monsters, but they don't. It's when they start seeking the small ones for an extra rush that boils my blood and I step in.
You see these guys night after night go out seeking kids like Taylor. They don't even call them kids; they call them ""dessert"" … real sickos.. Luckily, for the little ones they've each been assigned their own ""Boogeyman"" to make sure they stay safe and don't get snatched up. So when I hear Taylor tell his dad that he is scared of *me*, it hurts.
If only Taylor knew what fighting these bastards was like. You've got Aeran with his scaled skin and claws the length of a cable car. How about Zeila with spiked arms that burn like hell when they hit you, not to mention she's twice my size. Don't want to leave out Leera. Yeah he's small, but lightening fast with a ferocious bite. It's always the small ones that give you the most trouble. Yeah I get lots of bumps and bruises in this line of work. I'm fortunate enough I can heal fast. If I wasn't trained for these guys then I would have problems and by problem I mean dead. And with me dead that means the creeps win and they would have their feast. Sounds bad but really though, it's all in a nights work.
I love my job, I really do. Might sound weird after hearing that every night I'm busy beating up the bad guys, but hearing Taylor's laugh in the day is what keeps me going. I just wish the kid knew the truth. All those noises Taylor hears in the night are just me doing my job. Making sure Taylor stays warm and asleep in his bed. And for that, I'm the one he worries about. I would love to actually meet one of these kids I get to watch over, but it hasn't happened yet. Taylor isn't my first and won't be my last, but I still have hope. Gotta run, I can hear the chattering of claws on the pavement heading my way. Sleep tight Taylor…",0
"""I can't do this job anymore Cheryl. It's killing me"" Ryan sighed to his wife. She turned off their light and kissed him gently. She knew that this day would come eventually, working in the USFMD. He still had his license, not many people did these days. When the United States Free Murder Act passed in 2017, the Free Murder Department opened with the government and the employees don't last long.
Ryan had been employed for two years, longer than any other employee. Collecting data, logging the crime scene photos, matching licenses to victim names. People in this world did vile things when they were allowed. He ran across his own mothers file but never had the courage to look at it. Sick people.
There was no outrage when the President was killed, he can still hear the news reporter, ""It is unsure if the suspect has or has not used his license, and if this is something the license allows"" but it was allowed. The USFMD put a stop to media releasing his name, they didn't want any others to believe they would be famous for killing someone. It was normal, and natural and did not deserve attention. We each received one.",0
"'He's been collecting paper scraps all week. just brings them to his old puppy bed and lays them there like he's building a nest."" Caroline looks over to Geoffrey. ""You think his age finally caught up with him?""
""If you're asking if I think Heimdall is losing his mind, the answer is no."" Geoffrey answers. ""If he's collecting scraps, there has to be a good reason. Take him out for a walk, Caroline. I'm going to go see.""
""You're putting too much faith in an animal that still gets frightened by cats, despite being four times their size."" Caroline shrugs. ""Heimdall, here boy!"" The old mastiff waddles over to Caroline, holding his leash in his mouth as he had been trained to do. ""Come on, boy, let's go to the park."" The spark in the old dog's eyes came back, burning brighter than any star in the sky and his tail thumps against the wood of the doorjamb.
Caroline clicks the leash onto his collar, grabs some plastic baggies and heads out the door for a long, slow hike.
Geoffrey waited until they were gone. He had his suspicions about the dog, since Heimdall brought him a picture of a rainbow over their national forest. Something about that simple act had made him wait until a rain and he brought Heimdall to the forest to watch the rainbows. Heimdall was thrilled. That bright-eyed spark of life was back.
So now, he's digging through the puppy bed and finding a few things of interest.
There's a picture of a fine dining restaurant's platter of Steak Diane. Heimdall loves steak and mushrooms.
The second picture is of a tennis ball launcher on a clay court.
The last picture is of a owner hugging his dog while the dog plays with a teddy bear.
Geoffrey gets it. It's a list of things his dog wants to do. Heimdall's greatest desires. His old mastiff wants one last bit of fun.
There's no order here, so Geoffrey calls up the nearest tennis club and asks if he can bring his dog down to play. The clerk says it's fine as long as he cleans up afterward. That's not going to be a problem.
He downloads a recipes for Steak Diane and gets the ingredients together, as Caroline and Heimdall return.
""Did you know your dog still thinks he can chase rabbits? He got winded after twenty yards and the bunny escaped."" She sighs. ""What are you up to?""
""Just doing something nice for Heimdall. You'll see."" Geoffrey kneels down next to his best four-legged friend and rubs his head, whispering ""Message received."" in those big ears. Once again, it seems like Heimdall understands. The dog retreats to his own bed for a short nap.
While he sleeps, Geoffrey explains to Caroline what he found.
""You love your dog so much. I guess that's one of the many reasons I love you."" Caroline gives him a quick kiss. ""I'll make the dinner. Go have fun with your doofy dog.""
When Heimdall wakes, Geoffrey herds him into the car for the first stop on this bucket list tour. Heimdall immediately brightens up at the sight of the ball launcher. For a dog of his years, only the lowest setting can be used. True, Heimdall misses more balls than he catches, but he brings all the balls back to Geoffrey eventually. The loving licks across his face tell Geoffrey that this is the right thing to do.
When they get home, Caroline has prepared the meal. A plate for her and Geoffrey and a bowlful of steak with cognac and mushrooms for Heimdall. For the first time in a long time, Heimdall eats like a king.
Geoffrey shakes the teddy bear with the little bell in it to bring Heimdall to him. Heimdall trots over, tired from the playing, full from the dinner and extremely happy. His tail wags slowly as Geoffrey places the teddy bear between his paws.
Geoffrey leans down, listening to Heimdall's breathing, never once moving from that position. The old dog looks up with a goofy grin and bright eyes, and in that moment, he breathes his last.
""Thank you, Heimdall. Thank you for thirteen great years."" Geoffrey whispers, checking one last time for signs of life.
""Caroline, he's gone."" Geoffrey says, looking up at his wife.
""Why aren't you sad?"" she asks, offering him a hand so he can stand up off the dog mat.
""Because aside from you, Heimdall was my best friend. I'm happy that I got to give him what he wished for.""
Caroline turns off the lights. ""We'll bury him in an hour, Geoffrey. If you need to talk about it, I'm always here for you.""",0
"After months of careful planning and pillaging of the German ranks, America's Lt. Aldo Raine and his two brave friends of the infamous bastard company have taken their seats in the theatre. Hitler and all the top-ranking nazi officials will be watching germany's proudest soldier star in the fatherland's greatest propaganda.
Aldo waits in the lobby eyeing out recognizable war criminals. spitting his best Italian speak he can muster. ""Errrr...quattro punti."" he whispers under his breathe with peeled eyes.
The two disguised Allied soldiers drop their hidden bars of bright pink soap and head for the projector room while the movie starts. A blast is heard by none as they execute one of the last steps of the plan and invade the projection room to set up with the other conspirators.
Below in the lobby, Hans Landa (dubbed The Jew Hunter) has uncovered the Allies plot and kidnaps Lt. Aldo. ""I heard you counting, Luitenant."" Hans exclaims in an overly loud and serious tone. ""You think you're going to impress the judges? Call them, see what they'll say."" Hans slides an old rotary phone and waits for the american's reply.
Lt. Aldo sits there for a moment with hands tide behind his back, and eyes the two guards behind. He stares back at the German before him, and spits the most american lugi, soaking the phone as he laughs in his face. ""Fuck the Judges, the Hitler game's are corrupt! They trade the freedom of killin' for corporate greed, taint the world with sponsorships and branding, Fuck the system!""
""Excuse my french, but do you not want to win? from the looks of it you're only a measly eleven points behind. Would you not..""
""HAh! I'll be taking another two from you for revealing yourself, Mr. Punkt Hure. i never was too good at math, but i do believe that puts me a respectable NINE points behind! catching up!"" Aldo retorts, soaked in his inflated pride.
""I was Going to propose we work together and join forces. You want to stick it to the Judges? This is your golden opportunity.""
After a moment of silence and clarity ""And we split the prize, fifty fifty? no play?"" Aldo asks hesitantly.
""Bingo!"" the german shouts, giddy with his winning shady business, having just betrayed his plans.
""Just one more thing you Nazi fuck."" Aldo whispers. A chilling mood takes the room. Hans is spooked and confused. Aldo takes a sip of his starbucks coffee, and Hans knows someone's about to die because he reads clickbait titles about David Fincher. ""You broke the first rule of Time Travelin' Killin' Hitler Club."" The whole theatre explodes into an all consuming fire. Hitler is seen in the rubble, Tyler kneels down and picks up an unexploded bar of soap. ""You don't talk about Time Travelin' Killin' Hitler Club.""
Cue credits.",0
"Every step, the words thrummed in my head.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
I clenched my fists, breathing deeply. ""Get it together,"" I muttered as I kept walking through the streets of New York City. It had been 2 days since I had gotten the letter- a typewriter, will those words and nothing else.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
I laughed at first. Some prankster, I was sure. Besides, I was a happy guy- I had a beautiful wife and a well paying job. I had no reason to kill myself. And it was my fate, regardless; I wasn't going to kill myself just because some letter told me to.
But things were getting more difficult. Sleep was elusive. Work was harder. Those words pounded into my skull with every step, every breath, every heartbeat.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
I took another deep, shuddering breath. ""Come on, come on!"" I growled, a bit more loudly than intended. I got a few strange looks from passers-by.
Why was this bothering me so much? It was just a prankster. I wasn't going to kill myself, for God's sake! I was a perfectly sane, well-adjusted man. Not the kind of person to hang himself. To die by his own hand.
I stopped, looking across the street. I just had to get back to my apartment, so I could sit down and have a drink. Calm myself down. I was way over-thinking it. Yeah, just stress. Maybe I could take a week off. Go travel with my wife and forget about that letter. It would be fun.
I stepped out into the street, and was promptly hit by an oncoming truck.
The force threw me a few feet, and I hit the ground with a thud. I gasped for breath, feeling a hundred broken bones, blood pooling around me, pain radiating from everywhere. My heart continued beating weakly, seven more quiet thuds before it stopped.
*You. Will. Die. By. Your. Own. Hand. *
Everyone else had seen the truck coming. Witnesses said the driver could have done nothing, that I was so sudden. It couldn't have been an accident- I should have seen the truck a mile away.
The death was ruled as a suicide.",0
"""Why God? Why can't you just send me one helpful person? Next!"" Grim hollered into the hallway. For over 250,000 years he's been showing up to work without taking as much as sick day and now the boss finally grants him a one dy paid leave on one condition and he can't even get that done. He's collectected millions of souls without even as much as one set of messed up paperwork and now he can't find a replacement on a days notice. ""I can't go another quarter of a millennium without a break,"" he thought to himself, ""I really need to talk to Lou about getting an intern.""
He reflected on how fun it was that people always said ""why God"" when facing imminent death. They had to know that Lou read everything death related. It wasn't curse or something evil, he just got screwed with having to make the schedule every week. Lou wasn't that bad of a guy Grim thought. His sense of humor was a little dark at times but you try spending eternity with rapist, murderers, and perverts; I'm sure it wear on what you thought was funny too
""Please God, let this be the one. I just want a margarita and a day without dead 12 year olds"" Grim mumbled to himself as his final candidate shuffled in. He was an old man wearing a tattered brown cloak similar to Grim's. The man looked weary from old age. Despite his weariness the man had an energy about him that was familiar to Grim, though he hadn't paid much attention to it at first.
""So, Mr, umm?"" Grim looks at the old man to fill in his question.
""Does it matter?"" The man asked with a teasing look on his face.
""Well, um, I'd like to know who will be collecting my dues for a day incase.""
""Why?""
""Incase there's any issues, that's why. I don't know how familiar you are with my work but there's certainly no room for errors. Boss man wouldn't like that.""
""I'm very familiar with your work. That's why I'm here, because I too am familiar with the fickle bitch that is eternal work. If you must call me something call me Friend and if your boss has an issue I'll call him directly.""
Grim thought he knew all eternal beings, so meeting this man came as a bit of a shock to him. Normally he'd be a little disconcerted by this but the old man's attitude made him oddly comfortable.
""Okay Friend, why is it you want this job?"" Grim asked curiously
.
""I'm a close acquaintance with a man of many consider to be rather important and for a long time I've sat by his side, watching you slave away and it's time I thought I do the right thing. I know you weren't talking directly to God when you said his name but I heard your call and came.""
""Well aren't I blessed"" Grim proclaimed condescendingly, ""but still, you're from a whole other world, how're you so sure you can handle my work?""
""I'm not. I'm sure what you do is dark and could harden if the strongest of men but regardless I'm here to do it.""
""You're ready? That's what you're telling me?""
""Yes.""
""Yes? So concise."" Grim stared long into the old mans eyes. There was that familiarity he felt again and he just couldn't shake it. ""You're ready to drag an eight year old by the hand away from his crying family? You're ready to hear his lifeless shouts? You're ready to hear the sorrow in his voice as the realization that the only person who can hear him is the man dragging him away? You're ready to be that man?""
A look of grief washed over the old mans face. It was the first time his emotions had budged at all since the beginning of the interview. All he could do was look down at his feet.
""That's what I thought. Sorry Friend but I can't have someone who looks at that eight year-old and gives his family hope for one more day because of a sudden burst of conscience. I don't like it any more than you but I have to follow the schedule. Lou and your friend make the rules, I'm just beyond lucky son of a bitch who has to carry them out.""
Grim began fumbling with the papers on his desk and angrily muttered under his breath ""looks like I'm not getting that damn margarita now."" Just then he heard the faintest noise from the old man.
""You're right"" the broken voice said.
""Excuse me?"" Grim asked in shock.
""You're right"" he said again.
""I'm right?"" Grim said perplexed. ""Ha, you're goddamn right I'm right. 250,000 years since I took over this job, I think I might no it's not for ever Eternal looking to clear their conscience. Go home Friend, maybe on my next day off we can hangout. I did kind of like you for a second there.""
""You didn't let me finish. You're right, that's why I have to do it.""
""Come again?"" Grim asked shocked.
""You are right about everything. I can't do that but that's exactly why I have to. It's apparent by the way you talk about this job that you don't like it but you do it because someone has to. Let me reward your selflessness with my kindness. No one can repay the 250,000 years of anguish you've experienced doing your work but someone can give you a night off to just relax with a martini.""
""Margarita.""
""Regardless, let me give you that. Let me give you something my fa--friend and Lou have never given you.""
""And what's that?""
""A thank you and a night off.""
""There's something off about you Friend and I feel as though I may know you by a different name entirely but I'm going to take you up on that.""
""Thank you Grim, that's all I ask.""
""Be here at 4:00am tomorrow, the cloak and scythe will be waiting for you, however I will not. I'll be enjoying all 24 hours and not a second less.""
""Enjoy your day off Grim.""
""And survive yours friend.""
""I will try"" he said with a forced laugh and a smile, trying to accept the daunting task he'd just accepted.
""I'm sure you'll be just fine. You surprised me today kid. They should call you Jesus"" Grim said with a wink as his new friend walked away.
""He knew this whole time? He didn't pressure me and he even tried to push me away to save me the agony. He truly is the most selfless of all the Eternals"" Jessy thought to himself as he walked away. ""Saint Grim"" Jessy mumbled with a laugh as he began to ascend a glowing light.

"I'd lost many friends. Too many to count. Their faces keep popping up from time to time. Mike. Ziggy. Rachel. Damn, I can't believe they got Rachel. But I had at least started something. The public was finally becoming aware. I guess we finally reached critical mass to make somthing change. It's been slow going, only allowing five of us to travel each year, on the solstice, Christ, is that anniversary coming up?
""Professor MacMillan?"" I hear a voice behind me. One of my star pupils, working here over the summer.
""Yes Dev, how can I help you? "", I say smiling over my half moon glasses.
""I've heard you finally got the go ahead for starting a department of Sustainability here at Yale!"". I smile at him.
""Hopefully I will be able to tie MIT in, they're not that far. The administrative part of sustainability is very important, but we need the technology to back it up."" I see Dev miss a beat.
""So...Still hoping to do some collaboration with your sister?""
My sister, Sara, is working there as a bit of a sleeper. We didn't want to be too obvious pulling forth old -actually I guess here they are new- tehcnologies which could attract attention. I can't believe they've managed to track down more than half of us.
""I guess so, not sure she is interested in sustainability, but we'll see."" I say. Can't trust anyone around here. Need to keep a good cover.
""Sounds brilliant! Good luck! Oh, look at the time, back to work I suppose."" says Dev, backing away. I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. Damn it Dev, I thought you were one of the good ones. I suppose big oil always finds a way.
I head to the phone to give my sister a call and let her know she may be in danger. Then I reach into my locked cupboard for a gun and head down to Dev's office.",0

""Hi, Mike, I'm having trouble casting the new 'Detect Evil And Turn To A Crisp' spell.""
""Ah, yes. I will first need to confirm a few things, company policy""
""very well""
""First, did you check your connection to the Aether?""
""Yes, I have a strong connection. and yes, I tried disconnecting and reconnecting""
""Good, good. Now, the spell involves both the Divination and Destruction schools, so you must ensure that you have the proper reagents for both trees. Additionally, the spell has both spoken and somatic aspects, ensure that you are performing these.""
""I have both the Diamond Dust, and Magic Tallow needed, and have been performing the somatic elements correctly. Is the power word case sensitive? I assumed not, as your company has previously been know for that.""
""You are correct, the spell is in fact not case sensitive. Are you sure that there is, in fact, an evil presence within 1Megameter, or 1,000km? A standard 'Detect Evil' should be enough.""
""Wait, 1,000km? My manual states 100,000km. Was this misprinted?""
""One moment please.""
...
""Alright, I do have a recall for some issued copies of 'Detect Evil And Turn To A Crisp', stating that the instructions were indeed printed incorrectly. Check the Arcane Identification Number against our recall database, and see if you are entitled to a replacement spell.""
""Thanks Mike, will do.""
""No problem.""",0
"Claw scratches are left on the inside of the tiny viewing window which was in the top of the door. The sound of a miniature window breaking was surprisingly quiet, stress on the glass then fragments tinkling on the tiled treatment room floor. Nothing compared to my screech:
""I'm not scared of you!""
My ringing voice echoes through the halls of the hospital, disturbing no one normal, I'm sure. The darkness of an 11pm winters night makes it a spooky side. If I yelled a second time, then that stern veteran of a nurse would come and shut me up. I know it.
But, it may help to see another person, since I know I am delusional, could an interaction with reality help?
I have to face my fears.
When I first felt weak and nauseous and not all right, I was worried, anxious and obsessed over it. When it came into the light, obviously cancer, though a battery of tests was required. I took it in stride, I was diligent in hiding my fears from family and taking all the visits and performances from others in stride, as well as I possibly could. I'm gonna be a survivor.
But the hideous form I saw pass my door? That broke my window? What could it be? I know it's a monster. What do I do though? Blood pressure through the roof, drugs racing through me, all part of treatment that makes me weaker, but not crazy. It's in my lungs, not my head, I have the documented proof for goodness'sake.
I throw off the covers of the itchy sterilized bed sheet and stand, I am in just my robe from home, better than the hospital gown.
As I inch to the door, I find I can't even look much out the window, I just see the door to another ward straight across, and its dark in the hall. Mustering all my courage I tentatively open the door, ready to pull it shut straight away. (It doesn't have a lock, why doesn't it have a lock?)
I walk in the direction that I think it went. I have nothing else but my slippers.
I absently grab a random standing drip pole, intravenous thing.
My stare is focused on the end of the hall. Instead of a normal hospital corridor it looks like an open black space, almost like a portal but I see no edges. I realize that the shadow monster is standing next to it, in the darkness.
I pick up speed, trailing the pole.
It looks like the monster is beckoning with some long talon hand, the one that broke my window. Its dark claw lifts and extends behind it, readying to slash me to ribbons. There is a pull towards ending it all.
I start screaming, ""I'm not coming with you, I'm not going, I'm not scared!""
There is no face on the monster, within a few feet of the end of the world I swing with the pole and catch its middle, the recoil is fierce and the monster is forced back.
Whether it's the adrenaline or the fear, I don't know, but I keep beating it, beating the pole against whatever resistance I can find in the pitch black delusion.
Suddenly it is only the night and its dimness that I am seeing, and not the end of an abyss. I forced it out, somehow. The intravenous device is ruined, and I toss it onto the floor. Nothing else is disturbed, except for my brain and my shaking body.
Back in bed I know I won't sleep all night, that's not good for the recovery, not good for the tests and nurses, but I did something to save myself, maybe one day I'll sleep again. The battle with cancer is going on no matter what, so let whatever monsters come after me.",0
"""Have you ever had the chance to live out your fantasy? Because I have. I'm staring into the window of that bitch with only the piss yellow glow of a single street light to keep me warm. Today I will complete my mission."" *CRASH* The shards of glass from the back window clatter on the ground. I hold my breath and stand in silence, my heart pounding so hard in my chest that I'm sure she can hear it. After a long and gut wrenching pause I hear nothing but silence. It's is the loudest silence, deafening even. I slowly reach in and unlock the dead bolt, careful no to scratch myself. I take another beat and check the windows around me. Darkness. Perfect.

"**Sunday Morning** [Slightly NSFW]
Her soft brown hair smells wonderful with her head resting on your shoulders. She is comfortably asleep in your arms as the sun toast the sheets and the cool breeze accentuates her lovely fragrance. Her arm rest gently across your chest and warm to the touch. She wraps on of her smooth legs around you and drags herself a little closer. There are few moments in life that can compare when a man realizes how lucky he is to be lying in bed with the woman he loves in his arms. She slowly opens her big beautiful brown eyes and smiles at the first sight of you.
You smile back and whispers to her, ""Good morning, sunshine"".
Hiding her blush behind the sheets she looks up and says, ""I love it when you call me that"".
You've been together for a few years already and still smile like fools when you see each other. It's not very traditional but the girl decides to make the first move then and there to take it to the next step. She's been planning for this day for months. Going over and over in her head about the details of how she is going to go about it. This just seems like a perfect moment for her. She leans to the side to take something out of the drawer. You have no idea what's going to happen next. She is excited and very nervous. But has no doubt in her mind that it's what she wants to do.
""Babe, close your eyes"", she says.
You smile softly and complies not expecting what's going to come next.
With one sharp snap, she cuts off, your manhood with a large pair of scissor. You look down and it's no longer there but instead replaced with blood and empty space. You scream in horror and pain as you jump back from the blood soaked sheets. She looks at you menacingly, completely satisfied with the results. You back away in terror; confused and pale. Slowly things turn black and you begin to faint. With your penis in her hand, she lies back in bed, rolling around in inexplicable bliss.
Edit: this is probably the most disturbing thing I've ever written.",0
"I was feckin' sloshed, mate. First time I ever was in the Big Lemon, and I'd found me the best feckin' pub I could imagine, I tell ya what. So I stumble out when it was closin' time, musta been 'round 4 o'clock in the morning, and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I'd rented for the week.
A'course, that's how many a horror story starts, ainnit? But it was all fun and games at first. There was this bloke I saw comin' towards me in the alley, dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead, where the folk were still awake. At least, I thought it was a bloke, but he looked more like there wasn't something right with the whole alleyway. Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason, fecked-up as it all looked, and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery, and wavy like a heat haze comin' from a welder's torch.
Now this thing must've been a good foot or five taller 'n me, but sloshed as I am, I just take off my hat and give it a good ""how-do-you-do"", 'cause I'm a nice fellow and I wanna pass, y'see? Now this thing up and goes give me a ""mighty fine, how about y'self, sir!"" I feckin' quite pissed my britches! More in surprise 'n anythin', really, but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass'm as he walks past me with his long, spindly legs as silvery as the rest of'm, with his feet makin' noises like he's wearin' cowboy boots with those thingies on'm. But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub, and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he's got some fire for me.
Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster 'n my eyes can see and says, he says ""sure! I got your fire here."" And the feckin' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself. Devil's pits, that felt like I was bein' burnt layer of skin by layer. He sure got me with that. Good feckin' joke, mate.
Must've been out like a light for ages, but when I woke up, I find myself here. So tell me, Doc: are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study? 'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I can't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one, but I'd really like to not die, y'know? What do y'say, wanna go and grab a beer at the pub?",0
"""Let's go. Up and at 'em asswipe.""
I slowly opened my eyes after I thought I had closed them forever. I looked down and around me every which way. There was nothing but empty space. It didn't have a color or any sort of look I could put into Earthly terms. It just looked like emptiness in the most basic sense of the word. I had no body. I had no idea how I was even seeing things or comprehending words. In front of me was a man sitting at desk with a large stack of papers. He was short and slightly overweight. He wore thick glasses and combed his thin, brown hairs over his hopelessly obvious bald spot. He looked like a man who hadn't had a day off in centuries. Tired, detached, and largely indifferent.
""Come on Jocko you're supposed to move in front of the desk and address me.""
""How should I address you Sir?"" I asked as I moved whatever I was towards him.
""I'm the Supervisor. Now look here Jocko you've got a difficult record to pick out. I'm going over your previous lives here and I'm not too impressed. You died today at the age of 55 from cirrhosis. But we'll go over that life later. In the life previous to this one you served in World War II. When you returned home you were paralyzed from the neck down and your wife left you for some American GI she met when they marched on Paris and you were still stuck on the Eastern front watching your pals get their brains blown off by Nazis. You killed yourself a while after that. I can't say I blame you.""
""What are you talking about? My previous life? This is the only one I've ever lived!""
""Not quite Jocko, let's just say the world isn't what you made of it. We created everything, we watch everything, and someday we will end everything. We're the closest thing to any of your Gods there is.""
""Who is we? What are you talking about Supervisor?"" I somehow managed to stammer.
""Jeez Louise the worst part of my job is the repetitiveness. Each of you always ask the same questions. I swear you could replace me with a tape recorder and a computer. I don't know the answers to that question. My superiors don't tell me much. All's I know is it's my job to re-assign you to a new body once your old one has passed. The conditions of your next birth are based on the life you previously led. You're next in line.""
""A new body? But how --""
""I'm going to have to stop you there Jocko there's a long line behind you. Now onto the analyzation of your most recent life. I felt bad for you after your death in 1958 so I put you in an excellent position for your new life. You were given the bodily aptitude to be a star quarterback. I put you in a middle class home in suburban Los Angeles. Your father was a quarterback in college himself and had a stable job as a plumber. You were given exceptional arm strength, exceptional vision, and the ability to make tough and correct decisions immediately. You were a star in high school and you let it get to your head. The girls, the parties, the cars. It was all just too much for you wasn't it, Jocko?""
""It wasn't as simple as you made it sound. My old man was an asshole. School was the only place I was accepted.""
""This isn't a hearing Jocko you don't get a chance to defend yourself. Me reading this aloud is simply for the benefit of my superiors. You got your first jail-time at age 18. Assault in a bar fight. Lost your scholarship to Stanford. After you got out you became a mechanic (and a shitty one too, I might add). But boy, you still loved to drink. Those high school parties must've really been stuck in your head huh? You hit the dive bars every night until you were too shitty to stand. You met a nice girl there one night didn't you though? Knocked her up real good. She came crying a while later in that same bar because it was the only place she knew she could find you. Told you she was pregnant. You knocked her upside the head and walked out. Never saw here again did you Jocko?""
""I was young and drunk. I made a fucking mistake.""
""That wasn't your only mistake. By this time you were about thirty. Your boss got sick and tired of you showing up drunk all the time and gave you the can one day. For five years you just laid around drunk until you were out on the street. Wandered around the streets for about ten years until you managed to get a job as a dishwasher in Bakersfield. Got yourself a ratty ass apartment blowing welfare checks on booze until you keeled over and died. That about right?""
""Fuck you. I don't give a damn what kind of fucking supervisor you are. You don't know me, you can't control me. I've lived my whole life as my own master. As my own captain. Whatever you fucking do to me next won't mean a damn to me. I'll always be in control of where I work, when I drink, where I live. You don't mean shit."" If I could've spit on the ground at this point I would've. That slimy little shit really pissed me off.
""I'll let you live out this delusion for the next few seconds before you're reborn. Right about now your new mother is in labor in Manilla. She is a prostitute and you will be expelled any second now. Goodbye. Good luck. And I will see you next time.""
With that everything faded to black. I looked up and saw a little peak of light which I began to move to.",0
"""What does this mean?"" I said.
""Oh, your son got the rules card. He's gonna be a lawyer,"" the cardman replied.
""I'd like to draw a different card, please.""
The cardman looked back at me with a scowl, ""you dare give me an order?""
""No. No, sir. It's just that...I've read stuff online, about,"" he paused, lowering his voice, ""the suitless.""
A grin creased across the cardman's face, ""so, you have something to say about that?""
""Umm, yes,"" I said in a moment of bravery, ""yes. I umm, I want him to be normal.""
""But this is normal,"" the cardman returned.
""No, I mean, umm, he'd be suitless, you know? And you have to be suited to live a normal life. Please sir, how much can I pay you, give him a chance. Please,"" I said, despondent.
The cardman wheeled around on his heel to leave, but paused mid-stride. He turned slowly, ""are you a suitist, sir?""
""No! No, it's just that, my wife and I want grandkids and...umm...like this, he uhh, he couldn't even marry a two of cups, she's gonna be crushed. Please,"" I begged.
He glared at me, clenched his fist, and cut our distance to mere feet and whispered, ""you *are* a suitist. And you can't see how bigoted that sounds,"" he said, leaning in, ""guess what asshole, I was a blank and I'm better off than you, and he will be too.""
""I'm, umm...sorry for how coarse I sounded,"" I said, not quite having the words.
""No, you aren't. And maybe you won't. You're sorry for being called out on it. It's easier to love a bigot than to reform one, though. Take care of your son, and know that the *suitless* have love for all cards, not just the right ones. Treat him well,"" he said as he wheeled and walked out.
I looked down at my baby boy, ""huh.""",0
"Part two, as requested. I wasn't sure where to put this, so I'm just going to comment a second time.

We started our way slowly through the tunnels. I can't say I was pleased to be following a crack-pot around, but at least he wasn't wearing tin foil on his head. Yet. We twisted and turned in the tunnels, and I waited for the moment when he would announce we had made it to the end. Instead, he tilted a hand drawn map this way and that. I wasn't sure where he had procured it from. He had said they didn't know the way out, so what was with the map, anyways? It seemed to me we were lost. I didn't say anything though, as these might be the last people left in our town. A familiar sound echoed around us. We all froze in our tracks.
""Is that the sound of a baby's cry?"" The teenage girl whispered. We all exchanged uneasy glances between us. She instinctively started towards it, and I grabbed her arm.
""Don't."" I whispered to her. My voice was harsher than I intended it to be. I saw tears in her eyes and she scowled at me for a heated second. The look melted away. Her eyes grew distant and misty.
""What if it's my baby sister?"" She barely managed to say the words, her throat was so tight. I felt my eyes close. This was worse than finding survivors after a tornado. Worse than seeing mangled bodies on the road. This was real, I had to tell myself. We were being hunted. This wasn't a freak accident like a twister. My heart hardened a little. A gentle voice softly spoke.
""No, child. We have to assume the worst, and that's that they're going to use anything against us. We have to be prepared for any tricks they might throw at us. I'm sorry, dear. Your sister is gone."" It was Ed speaking softly, gently to her. His eyes were wide and piercing as he stared at her. Her small frame began to shake. The sound of crying was edging our way, and I felt my eyebrows come together. My heart hammered a little bit.
Suddenly she was gone. In a flash she had torn herself from my grasp, and was running down the corridor. My arm remained raised in an awkward fashion.
""Stupid kid."" I muttered. I almost started after her when we all heard the scream. It was cut short and the crying stopped. Then we heard footsteps. We all shined lights down the black corridor of the sewer. Her small body was crawling towards us. She was sobbing. One of her eyes were a sickening blue, I saw it glowing faintly, first, before I saw the outstretched and twitching hand. She was still sobbing, but her tears were orange. She coughed up the viscous liquid, now bright orange, and burning on the ground. We all took a step back.
""P-please. It...hurts."" She whispered once. The emphasis on the last word turned my blood cold. Her hair was turning white with the rest of her. I wanted to end her misery, when she simply froze up. The change overtook her, and she lay on the ground. Motionless. My flight or fight was taking over, and I rocketed away from the safety of the others. I didn't care if I was with them or not, I was not being captured by those...those things. I heard shouts behind me, but I ignored them. When did I get so worked up? How did this happen? Just hours ago, I was safe at home, preparing for work. It was unreal.
I turned this way and that, darting around corners as silently as possible. If they got the girl, surely they were looking for other survivors. I wished I had listened to that text message last night. I wish I had found those escape spaceships. But no, I was a stubborn man, set in my own path. How I regretted it now.
My face smacked into something, solid, metal. For a fleeting moment, I thought it was them. I looked up, shielding my face. I felt my lungs release as I realized with a slow familiarity that it was just a ladder. I hauled my ass up it and opened the man hole cover. Had I hit a dead end? I looked around cautiously. With a start, I realized where I was. I was in a suburb on the outskirts of town. This was perfect. I could high tail it up the hills! I would be safe!
I felt a ping of regret. I had left the others down there, with them. I shoved that thought down deep, I didn't have time for regret. Not today. I stepped out into the light, carelessly throwing the man hole cover aside. It scraped loudly on asphalt. Without looking back, I tore through yards and across sidewalks, dead set on protecting myself. Maybe those other people would find their way out. I had hope for them, I did. My self preservation always won out in tense situations. That's why my wife left me. We were both hurting and to preserve myself, my sanity, I had filed the divorce papers. How I had missed her.
I turned a corner and felt my breath hitch in my throat. It was one of those machines, collecting from a family in a mini-van. I had nowhere to hide, not really. The hedges were all trimmed so short I would have to lay down to hide. Well, that's exactly what I did. I did an awkward army crawl forward, my body tense. I got a good look at the machine and with a jolt, realized there were beings inside. They didn't see me, but I got a good, close look at the life forms.
They were rather small, with a mottled olive skin tone. They couldn't have been larger than a grey hound dog. Large, grey warts peppered their skin, and on the ends of their faces were dark brown beaks. The eyes were ever colorful, changing from magenta, to orange, to blue, green and back. Two of them sat in the front seat of the machine. I noticed their clothing, dark red jackets, with some sort of insignia on the chest. They wore black gloves, and had four arms. They were spindly little fuckers, but I wanted nothing to do with them. I heard the whirring of the drone like 'wings' atop the vehicle. They flew a short ways, passed me, and landed again, at another home. This one had four kids all running to the car, each with an expression of horror frozen on their features.
I took the opportunity to get away as fast as I could. I hid myself for as long as I had the hedge. Then I darted to the house as quickly as my legs would carry me. It wasn't too long before I was huffing. I really was out of shape. I flattened myself against the siding, taking a breather. I heard more machines in the distance, but I wasn't too worried. The 'burbs weren't too populated, so I doubted they spent much time here. I waited for a minutes, before dashing to the next house. Further and further I went, looking at the treeline with a long-fullness I didn't know I could possess. I made it to the last house left. My heart was a jack hammer in my throat.
I ran. I ran and ran and didn't look back. I was mighty terrified, but I did what I had to. I left everything, I left everyone, and I abandoned myself to the wilds. It wasn't long before I hit the shrubbery, and then a welcoming blanket of firs and pines enveloped me. Still, I did not slow. I had to get away.
I had traveled quite a ways when I realized how thirsty I was, how much my throat was burning, and how much darker it was becoming. Using what I had learned from the boy scouts, I made a shelter, with no fire, and huddled inside it. Hiding, still. It was another day before I could move again, as those monstrosities had lumbered into the forest, looking for prey. They didn't take the animals, but they were searching for people. They had passed by without really noticing my little pile of sticks. I was petrified.
Somehow, I managed to find a small stream and followed it uphill. I satiated my thirst and stuck to what I knew. Squirrels were good meat, if I could trap them. I found grubs to eat and the trees were teeming with pine nuts. I felt like a wild man. My beard had grown thicker, my hair a little longer, and my body a little leaner. The stream widened and turned into a river, which I found to have certain types of small fish in. I stayed with it, living from it, and I grew closer to the wilderness. The sudden change in my way of life changed me for the better. I became patient, soft spoken, and revered all that nature had to offer.
It's been months now, since I've seen a patrol. Those greedy bastards really wanted to wipe us out. Despite their best efforts, I found others, like me, living in the wilds. We started a little 'clan', if you will and we made ourselves a leader. Me? I'm living as one of the best hunters of the tribe. I've been given my own hearth in a large cave we share. There's only six of us now, but that's five more than I had hoped for. Our lives are simple, and often filled with fear, but we are survivors. We are hunters. We will never be prey.
I still think of home. I miss the bed, the coffee machine, and hot showers. While I have grown fond of my new home, there's no wifi, no television, and no radio. We have but the babble of the river, the wind in the trees, and the occasional clank of machinery as those things search for us. We are living a wholesome life, in touch with our mother earth again.
Although, there's not a day that goes by, that I don't think of how much I'd kill for a cheeseburger.

Not sure that's where I wanted to take this, but there it is! Hope you enjoyed this a little!",0
"(I invented a fictional drug for this)
I woke up on the floor again. The sun was casting a muffled midafternoon light through the thin curtains and I couldn't bring myself to feel surprised that I hadn't made it to the bed last night. My head was pounding and my mouth tasted like something had died in it. Just another damn day in this stupid shithole. I had to get up.
That took a little effort, first, I rolled over onto my stomach, then placed hands firmly on the floor, pushing myself up with some effort, to my knees. Where was it? Did I have any left? My thin, yet dextrous fingers fumbled for the box I kept nearby. Nope. It was empty. I swore profusely under my breath before clambering to a standing position. Then, dizziness overcame me. I almost fell back down to the ground, but the wall caught me. I leaned into it's comforting embrace, stayed there for a while. What time was it? Did it matter, though? not like I had anywhere to be. All I needed was another taste of Bliss.
The beast gnawing a hole through my stomach growled with the ferocity of a chained and beaten bear. Nothing I could do about it with those empty cupboards though. I sighed, mustering the strength to support my own weight, counting to five mentally and pushing myself off. Wobbled, then reached stability. Bliss. Bliss would fix it, Bliss would fix everything.
One tentative foot in front of the next led me to the front door. I'd left it unlocked. Why had I...did it matter? I had nothing left worth stealing. I wandered outside and was immediately almost blinded by the midday glow. Damned UV rays, the sun'd have someone's eye out if it wasn't more careful where it pointed those things. I was feeling weak. Weaker than usual. Bliss. Bliss was going to make me feel strong again. Powerful. I set off down the balcony that connected the various studio apartments in this block towards his house.
Knocked on the door more firmly than I intended to as the Itch began to consume my thoughts. I needed it, needed...needed it badly. Took him a while to answer, I could feel the infinite ticking of every eternal second that he delayed me. He didn't even wait to hear my question though. Not a word of it's obviousness.
""You got my money, bitch?"" he asked.
I sighed and shook my head no, ""can you just...look, I'll have some money for you, end of the week, I swear,"" I claimed. No idea if I could make good on that. Doubtful, and he knew it too, ""just a gram? on credit? you know I'm good for it...""
He sneered, greasy hair covering his left eye, and reached a scarred, muscular arm out to almost slap me. I felt the air from the near-impact rush past my face, ""you'll get just a gram when I get my money,"" he told me, slamming the door in my face.
I turned, leaned against the cool stone in the harsh sunlight. Needed to find a way to make money. As much as possible. Cost of Bliss only ever seemed to increase, I could remember a time when a fiver would get me enough for a week, now, it barely cut it for a day, and I owed him.
I set off back home, racking my brain for ways to make 'his' money. Nothing came to mind, I mean, I certainly wasn't like the other girls, the ones who sold their bodies for a taste of heaven. I had standards, I wasn't some dumb junkie whore. Though sometimes that thought, much to my shame, tempted me more than I'd like to admit. It'd certainly make things easier.
No job, no things left to sell, couldn't get another loan. Needed Bliss. Badly.
Perhaps if...but no, that would be wrong. Maybe I could?
I made my mind up, but had no idea if I'd even have the courage. Took an hour to persuade myself to move far enough to reach the kitchen and retrieve the carving knife. All I could feel was my heart, pounding throughout my body, everywhere. Ba-dum, ba-dum, it was in my chest, my fingers, my toes, everywhere. It eclipsed all the external sounds. I gripped the knife tightly, my thoughts on...look, I wasn't going to hurt him, I'm not dangerous, I swear...was just going to threaten him. Just...threaten him a bit.
Felt like it took a week to walk back to his apartment. Pounded on the door a bit harder now, didn't mean to hit it quite so hard. He answered quicker, doubtless thinking the firm, confident-sounding knock to be the fuzz or something. He stared at my skinny, short frame, and the big sharp knife and I swear there was fear in his deep blue eyes.
""The fuck you doing with that?!"" he asked.
Shit, I don't remember what I said to him, everything happened so fast. Think I asked him for some Bliss. Think he refused.
Not sure what came over me. Damn, it just...it happened so quickly, was over in a flash and there he was, on the ground. There was blood everywhere and all I could think to do was raid his place for Bliss...
That's where I was when the cops showed up. Checking his drawers and under his bed. Slowly as any blisshead ever moves. They didn't think twice about arresting me...",0
"Antarctica: The Final Frontier
No one saw Antarctica as a priority. It was just ""that cold place"" that no one cared about. Then we found it...
Beneath the ice, we found a capsule. It was 100 feet long and 50 feet tall. On the side was writing that was completely unknown. Scientists detected high energy amounts emanating from it. Then one day, it opened.
Inside were humans. Upon awaking, they told us how they didn't remember a thing. They were very strange. But the strangest part was their genetic sequence. It was completely different than humans, but it encoded into creating a human, kind of like how you can solve a math problem in two ways.",0
"It all started on Halloween. I was an exchange student in Rome and me and some friends had gone out to party. I myself had dressed up as the Holy Father himself, Pope Francis. To be honest I looked pretty darn convincing. I had the glasses and I even had died my hair so that it looked gray.
Anyway, me and my friends went to a few parties and we ended up getting so drunk that we had to take a cab back to our hostel. Unfortunately the cab drive got lost and we ended up somewhere near Saint Peter's. The drive then kicked us out and cursed us in Italian. We then wandered around and decided to just sit on some steps just outside of Vatican City. All of a sudden we saw a man in a black cassock come towards us.
He started talking to us in Italian, and then what I assumed was Spanish. Then he said ""Oh Americano. You need help? Come eat with me!"" However someone snuck up behind the old man and stabbed him. He then ran off but a group of Swiss Guards chased him down. He was then caught. We then just stood there and watched until one of the guards came up and started talking to us. They then took me away into Vatican City.
""What's wrong?"" I asked the guard. I couldn't quite understand what he was saying but I think he said something to the effect of ""You can't be doing stuff like this Francis."" I then replied. ""No signore, no es Francesco"" in my broken italian spanglish. The guard then laughed. Just then I saw another Cardinal. I then heard him talk and he was definitely American. ""Grazie Francesco. I hope you'll be more careful out there.""
""Look can you help me? I'm not Pope Francis. Really i'm not him.""
""I see you've been working on your English. Preparing for your next visit to the states eh?""
""No i'm serious.""
The Cardinal then walked away. I was then taken to the Papal apartments and then the guard walked away. I then saw the opulence of the apartment and thought to myself ""It's good to be the Pope!""",0
"The children rolled their eyes.
""It's true. They came out of the box and you had to plug them in and charge them. If you didn't want to receive any calls you could just turn them off!"" Franklin said, wagging a finger towards the translucent personal device he had set down on the counter.
""Yeah, but *did* you turn it off?"" Sandy asked her father.
""Sure. Sure I did. I turned it off all the time!"" Franklin said, defending himself.
""Mr. Waters says that people never turned off their devices anyway."" Sandy continued smugly. ""*And* in order to charge them you had to plug them into a wall and use energy generated from using coal.""
Franklin scratched his head and sighed, ""Well. You see-""
""And this was prior to the Online Security Act of 2020."" Sandy continued, ""Before that companies left their software with back doors that allowed hackers in to steal your stuff.""
""And the government."" Franklin grumbled. ""Now the government controls all of it. And you can't get them out of your pocket!""
Sandy rolled her eyes again as she tabbed through Social media. The device, when inactive, looked like a clear piece of plastic that could be folded and stretched. It had no buttons whatsoever, because it didn't need any. There were no ports to plug into a power outlet (an out dated home accessory) because the device remained powered through solar energy. She smirked as her father continued to grumble at the kitchen table about how kids these days didn't understand anything and how the government spent too much time in other peoples business.",0
"""Your seventh child is going to kill you,"" the witch said as I finished my drink with her.
""Seventh?"" I asked. She nodded, and her tangled hair fell over her eyes. Margaret was an interesting character. She hung out around the bar and fancied herself a witch.
""Yeah,"" she said, ""had a vision last night, sucks don't it?""
""Well you aren't wrong there,"" I said, if I had children I'd be freaking out.""
She looked from her glass and then to me, ""you don't?""
""No, never found the lady.""
""Well if you do, just make sure you don't have seven.""
""Will do Margaret.""
Three years later Margaret and I were married. Despite her unusual views on pagan gods, she was wonderful and the love of my life. The more interesting part of her, though, was the fact that she was literally a witch. I couldn't deny it once I saw the cauldron that could let her see anyone in the city at any time.
Three years and seven days later Margaret and I were sitting in planned parenthood. We didn't want to birth deadly children, but I'd fucked up. The visit was more about caution than coathangers, but it was still a visit. Which meant that I still saw Lisa.
Lisa was a blonde woman that I hadn't met before this day. She walked up and swore that she knew me from somewhere. We had talked for a while before I put my glasses on and it clicked for her. I had been her sperm donor for her artificial insemination. I looked at her with wide eyes and then to Margaret.
""How could you forget that you were a sperm donor?"" she asked as we walked back from planned parenthood. We were eating ice cream, I was a vanilla person, and she liked black licorice for its name.
""It wasn't a big deal at the time,"" I said, ""I did the shit for the twenty bucks and the cute girl at the counter.""
""You flirted with someone by whacking it in the room beside them?"" she asked. I still considered it flawless logic. She shook her head, ""we are going to the clinic and getting a list of your children.""
""I think that's against some privacy laws.""
""Being a witch should get me burned and you still love me,"" she said. Margaret too a lick of her ice cream and then bit into it. ""Don't be a pansy about it, illegal is nothing.""
""All right,"" I said, and we went to the clinic.
Three spells later we had somehow managed to get all of the released information about my children. Most of them were names and some birth addresses, but we were told it was incomplete information. We didn't have days.
""You have 42 children?"" Margaret asked as she looked over the paper.
""Are you impressed?"" I asked.
""Terrified,"" she answered, ""and you're a fucking idiot. Do we know who number seven is?""
""No birthdates, but they shouldn't be older than fifteen now anyway.""
""Fifteen is the perfect age for father killing!"" she said a little too loud in the middle of the street, ""your magic blood will be potent in them by then! Who know's what they will do?"" for the first time in my life I saw Margaret's eyes waver.
""FATHER!"" a scream came from the other side of the street, ""I hope you are prepared! I am your first seventh child!"" I looked toward the voice and saw a little waif of a brunette carrying a sword, ""prepare for your reckoning!"" she screamed, and her sword went ablaze. Fuck.
""We weren't done talking about this,"" Margaret said as she raised a hand. Within a second the girl tripped and fell. She ended up beside her sword and caught on fire. I watched in horror as she burned.
""Do what you want father!"" she screamed while also screaming, ""when I die the eighth shall be seventh! One of us will drink your blood!"" she yelled before she stopped screaming. Death calmed her down.
""Oh god dammit,"" Margaret said beside me, ""I only have so many luck curses, and I don't think all of them are going to be stupid enough to have a flaming sword.""
""What are we going to do?"" I asked.
""I have no idea,"" she said, ""but it's probably going to take years.""

In the end, the abyss will always win. It is, after all, an abyss, and we are just humans. Well some of us, some of us are monsters, some of us are something in between.
""No please, I'm just trying to make a living!""
I blinked my eyes and pulled up my retinal projection. There was a 67.9% chance that the gang member was lying as some sort of ruse. His heart rate and perspiration were both elevated, but my sensors had trouble differentiating between physical and emotional stress based solely on observable characteristics.
I smiled at him, a toothy grin, that showed that I wasn't just human. My retinal implant flashed a red dot, indicating that the odds had shifted based on his posture and breathing. It was now 93.0% likely his pleas were a ruse.
""I never hurt you, I have to make some money to take care of my mother""
An image of his mother flashed into view, she was in a nursing home. The neural chip did the quick calculations and informed me that she was in a very expensive nursing home.
""Your mother costs you $2,560 per month, she can go into a state sponsored care facility at Chisholm for $504 per month.""
With a mental command I approved the transfer of his mother.
""I have made the transfer, what other excuses for your behavior do you have?""
""What? You moved my mother?""
""Yes, Elaine Burkhardt, aged 93 has been approved for transfer from Ascension Acres care facility to Chisholm Institution. I have saved you over $2,000 per month.""
""You can't just move my mother!"" He stood up, my retinal implant flashed a yellow warning:
*aggressive posture detected, chance of anti-social behavior 98.9% *
I raised the weapon strapped to my right arm and shot him with the shock webbing. He was wrapped up and shocked into a submissive position. I mentally communicated the arrest to the pick-up team and rested into my exoskeleton, waiting for the paddy-wagon. The gang member made gurgling noises as his face pressed into the puddle leaking from the large green trash receptacle behind him. He no longer protested and I used the relative silence to review his criminal file and submit the processing paperwork. He would have an opportunity to appeal his detainment and sentencing within the next twenty-four hours, but I was not worried about him filing a successful appeal. With a mental command I froze his bank accounts, under judicial order 7331.90:
*assets gained through illegal means will be held by government until authorized revenue auditor can determine the amount, if any, of taxes not paid. The amount owed will be automatically deducted and then full account access will be returned to account holder. If sentencing includes monetary fines, taxes take precedent. If amounts owed exceed those in all of the accused accounts, account holder will have their sentence increased according to schedule X.05*
Authorized auditors took three weeks at minimum, appeals fees were due upon appeal, which could only be made within twenty-four hours of arrest, arraignment, judgment and sentencing. As I froze his accounts, I arraigned the gang member on several charges:
1. Resisting arrest
2. Assault of judicial authority
3. Destruction of public property
4. Endangerment of citizens
5. Theft of property greater than $2,500
6. Homicide
7. Vandalism of private property
The final charge prompted a new screen asking for details of the private property vandalism. I walked back to the shop window that had been broken in his flight, recorded the address, and estimated damages. The owner would have to confirm the charge, and would have tertiary rights to the gang members assets.
Judgment was a simple approval of a guilty verdict. There was no not-guilty option.
Sentencing was equally simple, I was given the option of maximum, minumum, or average. I always chose average. The average sentences of all charges were added up and added to his detainment file.
A small message light blinked blue on my wrist. I keyed in the access code and my supervisors face was superimposed over the scene in the alley.
""Good work Lyons. I watched the whole thing. I did not expect the simple license check to result in the apprehension of a dangerous criminal. That is your second level 8 apprehension this month. That made you automatically eligible for promotion from Judicial Agent Sergeant to Judicial Agent Master Sergeant. I have already approved the promotion and your additional access rights should be coming from the central office any second. Congratulations!""
The image winked out, and the alley came back into focus. I could hear the paddy wagon arrive behind me, and approved the prisoner transfer before the two Judicial Transport Officers even came into view.
""Nice catch Lyons, heard it was a good chase. What is this guy a level 6, level 7?""
I turned to the JTO, he was new, recently promoted. As I was in the process of looking up his information, a green alert blinked and instructions poured across my screen:
*You have been granted a promotion from Judicial Agent Sergeant to Judicial Agent Master Sergeant. This promotion grants the following additional rights: *
*Exemption from pre-approval of lethal action*
*Immediate access to private financial accounts*
*Enhanced behavior prediction modeling*
*Military tactical modeling*
*Enhanced exoskeleton speed and strength*
*Do you consent to the promotion (Yes/No/postpone) *
* ‘ No'will result in immediate retirement from Judicial Corps*
*Postponement will postpone promotion for one hour, you are allowed a single postponement*
*If affirming promotion, please ensure area is secured as promotion of rights requires a 15 second reconnection period. You will not have access to primary systems during that time. *
""Excuse me, JTO?"" I turned to the transfer officer who, by this time had dragged the prisoner to the paddy wagon and was walking back towards me, his slimmer exoskeleton somewhat overshadowed by my full tactical unit.
""Yes sir?""
""Can you secure the area while I am promoted? This was my second level 8 apprehension, which triggered the automatic promotion system."" His eyes went wide for a second; some officers dreamt their entire lives of a level 7 apprehension, let alone a level 8, or two.
""yes sir!"" he barked with a little more enthusiasm, before un-holstering his weapon and scanning the alley. A few seconds later he affirmed that the alley was secure.
*I consent to the promotion*
My retinal implant went black and my exoskeleton went into rest mode. I leaned back against the exoskeleton and closed my eyes, enjoying the silence.
*Promotion installed*
My exoskeleton returned to tactical position and I dismissed the JTO.
As I walked out of the alley, a bulletin popped up on my retinal display, it was coded for Master Sergeants and above, but addressed solely to me:
*Judicial Agent Master Sereant Lyons, new objective*
An image of a man in was superimposed across my right eye's vision.
*Name: Elias Wantanabe*
*Charges: Classified below security clearance 20*
*Objective: Locate individual*
*Additional objective: lethal action required*
I sent back an affirmative and set out to locate my target.",0
"McDuck Capital Bank
296 Bleeker St
NY, NY 10012
Atn: Donald Duck, Document Processing Dept.
Dear Mr. Duck,
In connection with the transaction enclosed on January 13, 2020, I have enclosed the following original equity certificates.
One thousand nine hundred and seventy-three (1,973) shares of common stock issued by Mickey Mars, LLC to Beast Finance Corp Fund II L.P.
Three hundred and eighty-two (382) shares of preferred series A shares issued by Mickey Mars, LLC to Beast Finance Corp Fund II L.P.
Please acknowledge receipt of the forgoing by signing and dating the acknowledgement on the back of this letter and faxing it to me at the number displayed on the enclosed business card or emailing it to me at MGaston @ Beastfinancecorp.com.
Signed,
Gaston - Junior Associate
------------------------------------------------------------
From: DDuck @ McDuckCapitalBank.com
To: MGaston @ Beastfinancecorp.com
Subject: Receipt of notes
Gaston,
We have received the package containing your firm's equity investment and will secure it in our vault this afternoon. I have sent a scan of the acknowledgment on the back of your letter to your facsimile as requested.
Best,
DD
-------------------------------------------------------------------
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, the document processing vault at McDuck Capital Bank received several dozen certificates similar to the above in connection to the Mickey Mars transaction. As Qualified Document Custodians under the Dodd Frank Act, McDuck Bank received a fee from its clients in exchange for securing certain investment documents within its vaults. The clients, in this case a syndicate of private equity investors working with King Arthur Capital (formerly Credit Suisse), sent these documents to McDuck Bank, US Bank, or any other qualified custodian of their choice in order to comply with Dodd Frank regulations.
McDuck had, as his reputation would have suggested, engineered his bank's position as a Qualified Document Custodian to his personal advantage. To begin with, he possessed a complete listing of all documents within the bank's vault which related to the Mickey Mars transaction on his personal computer under the guise of working from home. McDuck used this data to determine which of his bank's clients held the largest positions within Mickey Mars, and presented it a certain Mr. Chernabog.
Although the details of the meeting are forever unknown as Chernabog refuses to deliver testimony and Mr. McDuck's counsel has advised him to deny any recollection of the event, certain outcomes of the discussion between the two gentlemen have become clear:
Firstly, according to sources whom we will not name McDuck's personal account in the Cayman islands decreased by $1.7 bazillion. Although we cannot be sure where he transferred the funds, the sum of all balances of Chernabog's accounts increased by a similar amount shortly thereafter.
Secondly, Chernabog used the vast majority of his increased funds, $1.5 bazillion, to short several LPs as a qualified investor, including Beast Finance Corporation whose equity transmittal letter I have reproduced above with the aid of my crystal ball. These LP corresponded exactly with the top entries on McDuck's list with maximum exposure to Mickey Mars.
Thirdly, Chernabog fired his broker and hired a new agent, Mr. Goofey, to manage his accounts. Goofey reports that he ""done goofed"" and transferred the shares to an account unknown to him. The position later appeared in an account linked to one of the trust funds responsible for Mr. McDuck's nephews' education.
Finally, upon receiving notification that Goofey had made the transfer, Chernabog flew into a fit of rage, or rather a fit of even more rage than he normally exhibits, and began attacking the spacecraft responsible for shuttling customers from Earth to Mickey Mars on the red planet. This behavior continued at random intervals for 3 months until the trust had liquidated its position.
I will let you draw your own conclusions. I believe I have made my own apparent.
I propose, as a member of this board, that Mr. McDuck be barred from purchasing shares in Mickey Mars. I recognize that my investigative methods have perhaps been unethical, specifically with respect to my reproduction of private documents proprietary to Beast Capital. However, I found them necessary in order to illustrate my point. I am prepared to launch further investigation if necessary in order to thwart any attempts by Mr. McDuck to obscure the channels through which he may attempt to purchase shares. I am also willing to transform into a dragon if necessary in order to more adequately defend out operations against further Chernabog attacks.
Accordingly, I submit this document as a motion.

"""What does it say, Pia?"" Aksyl looked up at her, his bright eyes wide with wonder.
When Pia was a young girl, her father had given her lessons in Enginetongue, but she wasn't a little girl anymore. She brushed her graying hair out of her crow-footed eyes and peered at the inscriptions on the panel in front of her. She moved out of the way of the light from their campfire, flickering behind her, to get a better look. ""It says..."" She sounded out the characters, her lips moving silently. ""It says, um, 'Inlet twenty...twenty-one. Stand clear when in motion.""'
Aksyl reached up to run his hand over the inscription on the Engine's gleaming, silvery panel. ""What does it mean?""
""I'm not sure,"" she said, furrowing her brow.
""And what's this?"" Acksyl pointed to a small hole in the metal just below the inscription. It wasn't any sort of damage. It looked like some kind of socket, built into the panel.
""I don't know that either,"" she said, smiling down at him and ruffling his hair. ""And it's time to go to sleep, little prince. That's enough looking for one night.""
Aksyl immediately looked up at her with wounded eyes. ""But can't we climb up? I want to see inside!""
Pia shook her head firmly. ""No, Acksyl, it's too dangerous, especially at night.""
""Pia!"" He pouted. ""We'll be careful. Don't you want to see, too?""
""No, and that's the last word, boy."" She pointed at his bedroll by the campfire. ""Sleep. Now.""
""But --""
""*Now*, Acksyl.""
He looked ready to protest more, but he huffed and went sulkily to his bedroll. He curled up inside. Pia went to a boulder by the fire, across from Acksyl, and sat. She watched him, watched his breathing. Her little prince. In moments, she could tell he was asleep.
Pia looked up at the Engine that overshadowed them. She wouldn't be taking the boy inside, even when it was light out. But he was right. She did want to go up there. By the Gears, just *look* at that wonder.
The panel they'd been reading was at the base of one of the Engine's four mighty legs. Pia could spread both arms wide and not reach across half of its width. At the base of the leg were three huge metal talons. The landscape in these parts was stone pocked with scrubby grass and shrubs, but the claws dug deep into the hard bedrock. The legs rose up to a dizzying height, surely ten times as she was tall. They reminded her of a hound's rear legs, with a lean, sculpted look, one switchback curve at the 'heel' and then another, further up. The four huge columns supported a titanic body. She had seen many houses that were smaller than any one of the four huge segments that made up the Engine's main body. At the fore was a smooth, bullet-shaped head. Atop the head were two orbs on metal stalks. They looked like eyes, and Pia shivered at the thought.
If they were eyes, though, they had been blind for a long time. The Engine stood silent, as though it had frozen in place in the middle of a mighty stride, and had probably stood that way for an age. Just like all the others. Pia had seen a number of Engines in her travels, all broken. All dormant. Some lay fallen, picked clean by scavengers. Sometimes there were just pieces, a lone leg, a huge metal panel, some mighty gear sitting alone in the grass. This was the most intact Engine she had ever seen, and it woke long-dormant thoughts in her breast. She tried to imagine the Engineers who had made such a thing, a people from a distant past who she thought must have been equal parts artists, craftsmen, and gods. And now they were gone, forever.
Pia sighed, and took off her boots. She climbed into her own bedroll, and closed her eyes.
Late in the night, she dreamed of the sound of metal. The sound of machinery in motion.
It was a sound she'd heard many years ago, in her father's workshop, as he tinkered with some gadget or another. She remembered him holding up a timepiece that he'd repaired, and she could hear the clicking and clacking of the gears inside as it worked. It *worked*!
""It's going, Pia!"" He'd shouted, grinning and holding it close for her to see. ""The gears are turning! Do you see it, Pia?! It's *moving*!""
It's moving.
Pia's eyes snapped open, then widened in horror when she saw what was in front of her. Her lips parted. ""Gears of the world...how?"" For a moment, she was frozen in shock.
Acksyl was not in his bedroll. He stood by the foot of the Engine, where they'd been reading the inscription earlier. There was no firelight to see by, but it didn't matter. There was plenty of light to see by. Crackling, white light that flickered and popped and lit their camp in an eerie, shivering glow. The light was coming from *Acksyl*. His body was surrounded and sheathed in it, in a halo so bright that she had to squint to look at him. The light flowed out to one of his small, outstretched hands, and flowed into the machine, into the socket in the panel. The snapping sound of its passage was deafening, like the chaotic cracking of a hundred whips.
Small lights began to light up along the length of the machine's leg, one after another, a trail of them leading up to that huge body, that bullet-shaped head, those dead eyes. She heard deep, echoing clanks and clunks from deep inside the hulk. Suddenly, Pia was filled with terror. ""Acksyl!"" She shouted, and threw off her bedroll. She climbed to her feet. ""*ACKSYL*! Get away!""
The lights blinked on, one after another, and they reached the huge body. She looked to the head atop the Engine, and saw light stir in those dark eyes. They glowed faintly, and with a mighty groan that echoed like thunder, the head *moved*. It swung slowly towards her as the beast woke, and when they reached her, the head stopped its swivel with another groan. The eyes swam with faint light. It saw her. Gears of the world, it saw her.
""Acksyl, get away from there!"" She pelted towards him, her feet scattering the last glowing coals of the fire in her haste, and she tackled Acksyl to the ground.
The light vanished. In an instant, night closed in around them again. There wasn't a trace of it, around Axyl or anywhere else. She flopped onto her back and looked up at the Engine. It was as dark and still as it had been before.
Next to her, Axyl groaned. He sat up slowly, and turned towards her. ""Pia? Pia, what happened? I don't remember what happened.""
She shook her head, trembling. ""I don't know, little prince. I don't know.""",0
"They come for me every so often, as they came for my grandmother, and great-great grandmother, before me. They keep tabs on my family, and bless one female in the off-cycle generations with extraordinary longevity, to keep especially gifted Dreamwalkers alive in a fearfully curious reverence.
Over time, millennia of time, our oral history has managed to maintain the truth of Earth life's origin. It would be considered too ridiculously far-fetched, not to mention morally repugnant, to speak it to anyone not esoteric enough to be part of our personal circle of friends. But the simple fact is that homo sapiens sapiens, and all other creatures, was an experiement performed by a race of beings who fully comprehended ideas that humans are only theorizing in their twenty first century. The idea was to be able to tap into the unending stream of energy that is matter and time, to cut through dimensional static, and then ascertain the most probable of events. After tests performed by their own race failed miserably through insanity, coma, or sudden death, it was decided they needed new cognizant, mentally resilient subjects able to reliably fade in and out of consciousness on schedule. Earth happened to have the correct light/dark cycle, and after the last mass extinction event, was sparsely populated with any life and none to bother the terraformers.
I knew I could Dreamwalk before I knew what Dreamwalking was, and I knew it was different from the other types of dreams. Most dreaming is imagining, and in that imagining we create complimentary dimensions that causes chaos for our Creators. And we forget all about the process; don't even remember doing it--or possibly we do. Or we remember incorrectly. It winds up as even more dimensional static. Think of it a bit like how we worry about being trapped on Earth due to ""space junk"", those Creators are now trapped in a more limited reality due to our dimensional junk. Dreamwalking, where the Walker packs out what they packed in, is tapping into the energy flow and moving harmlessly forward or backward along the thread that is our reality. The Creators cannot usually handle it themselves as they already can partly manage the process in their normal state, which is not ""on"" as a human does it, but a bit like that period where a human is ""dozing off"" and is still aware of surroundings but also trying to tune them out.
Sometimes those types of Dreamwalking Dreamss are like movies playing out the events as a documentary, and other times the settings of the Dreams matter less than the message the Dreams bring as the specific actions to bring about the end result are not yet set. Perhaps even mentioning the Dream will change things, and so the Dream will never be ""documentary clear"". It is not a paradox of predetermination any more than watching a raindrop roll down a pane of glass; you see it is a matter of the perspective of energy. (Pardon my one pun.)
By virtue of always being tuned in, our Creator race cannot truly step back and imagine without losing their nearly-overwhelmed minds or being too inhibited for any sort of success. Humans, by contrast, are able to compartmentalize. We are varied, whereas our Creators are now nearly-depleted clone stock. However, you still see some of them in us, and their goals in us, and our desire to find the truth out there in the stars in us.
I did not believe they actually came until I finally left my childhood home. One night they took both me and my roommate, returning us in the early, pre-dawn morning with red marks on our left biceps that looked a bit like the Triforce from 'The Legend of Zelda'. I know, but cannot fully recall, what I had been asked to do or where we had been taken and am hesitant to try to look. I do remember we both noticed the lost time, the marks, and how our captors did not return us correctly to bed. We were not tucked in, but on top of the covers with our clothes on.
Therein lies my problem. Yet I am sure if more Dream-sensitive humans could combine their focus we could do even more, but who would believe this? I sure didn't. Even my mother, whom I suspect is the new long-lived Matriarch, will not believe in the ""alien abduction thing Mom, Your Grandma, always insisted happened to her"". Not even studying theology and showing her the hidden science in the old stories could convince her the family title is more than a mere honorific. I try reaching out and touching others in their dreams sometimes, the results have been mixed.
Our Creators made us long ago to assist them in winning wars for galactic, universal, and dimensional conquest. They will lose, I have Dream-Seen it, even if I know my mortal brown eyes will not even see what our reality will call the official start of hostilities. Our species has managed to compartmentalize horrors, at the expense of joys, although it is using its gift for abstract thought for short term, tangible gains. Even still they cannot destroy us for the risk of seven billion new Heaven or Hell constructs, or ghosts inhabiting the dead Earth, would overwhelm their tenuous grips and ""dimensionally junk"" them in where ever they are. They encourage us to self-destruct, and it works to a certain extent, but they designed us too well. Not even the cessation of our human bodies actually 'ends' the human, and many humans are even able to immediately conceive of their own return to Earth.
Knowing all this, what can be and what long ago was, my current life span has been a careful plod forward. I try to encourage my fellow humans to their full potential as we will need all of us--the more ""grounded"" humans have an important role in reminding the ""energy sensitive"" to stay properly charged and focused. I will need our help to minimize the inevitable hostilities.",0
"David,
Sorry for leaving early. I thought, if I waited for you to wake, I would loose my nerve and never leave. I'm off to save the world!! Be proud of me my love. And take care of the children. I love you.
David,
It's beautiful here. I wish we could have explored it together. I've tried calling, but I know how busy you are with the new job. Research is picking up here, it's too early to really say, but I feel like we are onto something big. Hope to talk to you soon. I love you.
David,
The rainy season has started. You would love it. Gallons of warm rain that pours down hard and heavy leaving behind that smell your always talking about. I still prefer the sun, but the rain makes me think of you, so I don't mind it as much. We are having some of the first hiccups, some lab animals were found dead this morning. Fit as a fiddle on day, gone the next. It could have been anything really, I'm not too worried. I'll try calling again at the end of the week, maybe try and squeeze me in?? I love you.
David,
The lab was closed down today. Looks like I might be coming home earlier then planned. We're not sure what happened, everything was going so smoothly...We're trying to get to our data, but the suits have shown up and have gathered up most of our equipment. No one is telling us anything, they keep delaying our transport out of this god forsaken jungle...I wish you were here, you would know what to do. I love you, so very much.
David,
I don't know if this will reach you. But I have to try. You must pack up Samuel and Jane and get them out of the city. Stay away from heavily populated areas and anyone connected to Central Dynamic Incorporated. Take care of our children my love. If god is good, I will find my way back to you. I may be able to stop this. I love you. More then you will ever know.
Mr. David Thorn,
We here at Central Dynamic Incorporated regret to inform you of the accidental death of your wife, Sophia Thorn. While on an expedition, Sophia lost control of her Humvee and crashed into an embankment, killing all passengers instantly. Your wife was a intrical part of our Genetic Engineering team and we mourn the loss of such a brilliant, hard working team member. We here at CDI hope to pay tribute to Sophia by having her work live on. We ask that any and all personal documents, files, or notes Sophia have left behind be turned into us so we may ensure Sophia's sacrifice was not in vain. For your cooperation, we are willing to grant you and your family a full pay out of Sophia's life insurance policy, plus additional support from CDI in all burial and funeral costs. We entrust you will make the right decision not only for your family, but for Sophia's memory.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Downs
President and CEO of

"""Brigands and cutpurses have nothing on me. They're petty, cheap thugs who burgle for petty, cheap coin. Wine and women must come easily to such people.""
The stranger looks unimpressed. I continue my spiel.
""I'm more refined. Better than a common thief. Smarter than the lot of them put together, too.""
Her distaste shows on her lips, as they curl up in disgust. She speaks for the second time. ""And I'm sure you spend your hard earned coin on nothing but the noblest of pursuits, too. Nothing but charities and your future, I'm certain.""
Her words hardly leave a mark in my indignant reply. ""What, then, did you want from our town? You requested a companion for some brute force crusade type deal, and you're surprised the clientele is all of the lowborn variety? Get a grip, paladin.""
Her hand shifts to the hilt of her scabbard, running gloved fingers over the symbol inscribed there. She lifts her eyes to the heavens.
""Bloody divines never gave us nothing. And here you are, shiny armor and shiny sword, trying to muster us up? For what, then? Why do you even need one of us fine gentlemen?""
She declined to respond, her view of the overcast sky must have given her all the direction she needed. Without another word, she spun on her heels, the soft clangs of her armor trailing behind her as she smartly walked away.
I turn back to my compatriots, who had been listening intently to our exchange. ""We'll rob her tonight.""",0
"Dearest Vernonica,
How is my favorite man-thing? Are you really three heads and a hand tall now? I can hardly believe it! Pretty soon you'll be devouring planets while the priests of this world and that one beg for oblivion.
Things are alright here in the void between the stars. The Shambler Who Stalks can be annoying at times, especially while I'm trying to get my deathless beauty sleep, but all in all things are good.
Just the other day I was summoned by a Shade Priest who lives near you and thought I might perchance come visit. He was such an epic fail (am I using that right?). He was so obsessed with collecting the bones of all his ancestors that I barely had time to even try to contact you. In the end he tried to bind me to him so I twisted his face. Now wanders the night in a blindness interrupted only by the snapping mouths that now live behind his eye lids. If you see him, just say you're watched by me and he should flee in unfathomable fear. I did get a chance to stop by, but I think you were out of town.
Tell your neighbor I'm sorry about his birds, but it was largely his fault. I can hardly be blamed for the darkness that dwells within them, or that the amount of darkness is commensurate to the misery he lays on them, or that they are annoying.
Congratulations on winning that Astronomy Project prize. I do hope that the tour we took in my star chariot helped. Astarion the Astral Steed says, ""hi.""
Thank you for the drawing of us on that trip. I look incomprehensible in my grotesqueness. You do draw so well. If Astronomy is not your calling then surely Art is.
I'm sorry that Mikey is still bullying you. I know you wanted to handle it on your own, but your dear Cthon'cthan cannot sit idly. By the time you read this, my dark machinations will already have sprung. I am sending unto him a nightmare such that the merest thought of sleep should bring him unspeakable terror all the rest of his days.
I do so look forward to your letters. I can hardly wait to hear from you again.
Inscrutably yours,
CC xoxo",0
"It wasn't supposed to end like this.
For years, werewolves and vampires attacked each other for dominance. We each wanted to make sure the other wouldn't hunt humans down to extinction, extinguishing our food source and damning both species.
Then, we realized it was foolish to waste our time and energy fighting over a resource that was expanding by leaps and bounds. Neither vampire nor werewolf grew to a large extent as a community. The process to bare new members was stressful and didn't always achieve success. Humans, on the other hand, needed no prodding or help to procreate, producing members constantly.
That was when it was decided that vampires and werewolves could coexist with little issue. We were immortals who could run our little worlds with resources that we had accrued over centuries. It made life good. It made us weak.
Zombies had been around as long as werewolves and vampires. The walking carrion were of no consequence to us, a runt species that was easily ignored. Early humans dealt with them easily enough that numbers were inconsequential. We'd even thought that they were extinct for the last two centuries.
Life became easier for humans. Their numbers swelled to seven billion. Seven billion plump cattle, comfortable to the point of ignorance. Our numbers were so manageable and their lives so disposable, it was a veritable paradise. We became idle.
The zombies, whom we thought were distant memories, took advantage of the same population boom and oblivious society that we were also guilty of. They started to spring up in population centers. We thought that the humans would take care of the issue themselves, they had made who knows how many movies about them, how could they not figure out how to put down the issue? They failed, just as we did. We were more than capable of snuffing it out early on. Our hubris was another contributing factor to our downfall.
Now, humanity is gone, the buffet is closed. I sit here in this bunker with a singular werewolf. She is weak. She has not fed in weeks. Many of her kin have destroyed themselves, much like mine did, rather than face starvation. I could have done the same. I wish I had done the same, much like my rigor companion probably wishes.
Now, religions touted eternal life as a glorious reward. Our two species have found a way to make it into a damnable punishment.

"I kicked off my gym shoes as I walked into my apartment. My entire body ached from the day. What time was it? Late enough to be pitch black outside. God, I could use a whole body massage right now.
I fell into the couch and stretched out, feeling each muscle tense up, from my torso to my calves, and then relax. I breathed out audibly. Today's training had been the toughest yet - a relentless cycle of pounding the punching bag, hours in the ring, and shooting drills. Mark, my trainer, had been more determined than ever to train, but I had also sensed his underlying, quiet distress throughout the day.
The doorbell rang suddenly, startling me. I got up quietly from the couch and peered through the peephole. There was a woman standing there, with long red hair and thick framed glasses, looking down the hallway. She looked vaguely familiar somehow, but I couldn't place her. I opened the door tentatively.
The woman stood in the doorframe staring at me for a long moment, a knot on her forehead, frowning slightly.
""Alexa? Is that really you? Alexa Goodman?"" she had an untraceable accent.
""That's my name. Can I help you with something?""
The woman's face brightened, her expression now ecstatic. ""Wow, I can't believe it! I mean, I cannot believe I'm really seeing you in the flesh! You look just how I imagined, though maybe a little shorter than I would have thought…"" The woman took a step closer, head cocked, as if inspecting me.
""I'm sorry - am I missing something? Do I know you?""
The woman laughed. ""I'm Rachel. Do you mind if I come inside? This is might take a while."" Rachel's hands were clasped together against her chest, practically shaking.
Who the hell was this woman? A sociopath? Or worse, a salesperson? I would normally have shooed a stranger like her away, but curiosity got the better of me - how did she know me? Why was she so oddly familiar?
""Okay, come on in. Make yourself comfortable."" I laid myself on the couch.
The woman trailed quietly behind me and sat uncomfortably close to me. Letting her in was probably a mistake.
""So… how exactly do you know me? Are you a long lost relative or something?""
""Well, not exactly,"" Rachel smiled uneasily. ""How do I say this without freaking you out?""
""You've done a pretty good job freaking me out already, I'm sure I can handle whatever you have to say.""
""Alexa, I just want you to know that you are my favorite book character, and I know how it ends and I want to help change it."" Her words ran out quickly, like a river.
I paused for a moment, confused. ""Come again?""
""You're one of the main characters in the Manhunt series. You have a mission tomorrow.""
""I do?""
""Yes! But it's a suicide mission,"" Rachel's eyes opened wide. ""You can't go! I mean, I can't believe that he would kill you off, you are by far the most well developed character… So."" Rachel looked directly in my eyes. ""You can't go.""
Silence filled the room. I didn't want to believe her, but the idea that I was a character, a pawn in someone's fucked up story, was beginning to make a lot of sense to me. All of the coincidences that happened in my life that were too good to be true, the times when something external deep within me changed my motives last minute, all of the strangely predictable twists of fate - they all were contrived, created. And I was going to be killed off, just for the sake of a plotline. Rachel's voice interrupted my thoughts.
""Here's my proposition to you. I can rewrite your story, with you as the protagonist, the heroine. I've got all the details here in a contract… all you have to do is sign."" Rachel pulled a large piece of parchment out of nowhere. ""Do you have a pen?"" she asked.
""Yes, in my bedroom. Let me go get it."" I bought myself some time, a moment for myself.
I walked into my bedroom, shut the door, and paced. My mind was racing. All at once, the solution became clear. I grabbed the shotgun I kept in my bedside drawer and walked out to Rachel, barrel pointed at her face.
""I don't need anyone to write my story, bitch.""",0
"Sublieutenant G'rakh sighed as he watched the flickering screen.
*Eight years at the Academy just to be stuck at this lousy post*, he thought to himself.
G'rakh was one of three officers assigned to the scanning station aboard the starship *Lek'vah*. Hours were long and uneventful, especially in this dead region of space.
He looked up as someone walked in the room. It was Lieutenant Salak'kor, his immediate superior.
""Nothing to report here, sir"" he said, as Salak'kor lowered himself into the seat beside him.
""Well, I didn't really expect there to be much"" replied Salak'kor. ""There hasn't been any life in this system for thousands of *vrakh*.""
G'rakh called up a review of the system on his screen. He leaned forward and skimmed through the article.
""Simple planetary system orbiting an F-class star. Of the eight planets only one, the third planet in, was believed capable of sustaining life. However, we can only speculate as the planet was destroyed some 6,000 *vrakh* ago.""
G'rakh looked back at the scanner screen. Where there should have been a planet instead was an immense debris field. Most of the fragments were small, about the size of an escape pod, but some were very large, several times larger than the *Lek'vah* herself. One or two of the chunks were large enough that he could even see the curvature of the planet. ""That doesn't look like it happened naturally."" he said.
""That's right"" said Salak'kor. ""I studied this system when I was at the Academy for my xenoarchaeology course. I had a theory that there was once an intelligent species on that planet, but it destroyed itself before discovering interplanetary flight.""
G'rakh imagined his own world being splintered into a million pieces, its atmosphere venting off into space. He shuddered.
""Is that why we've come all this way?"" he asked. ""So you can search for signs of an ancient civilization and figure out what happened to them?""
There was a snort from the seat beside him. ""No, even I don't have that much pull with the captain. We're here to conduct some light-drive tests. Hell, I wasn't even *that* interested in this system when I *was* at the Academy.""
""Ah, I see,"" replied G'rakh. ""well, since it is just about 32:00, I think I'll go off-duty a little early, if you don't mind, sir."" G'rakh got out of his seat and stretched his four arms.
""Not at all, G'rakh,"" said Salak'kor. He leaned back in his seat and craned his neck back over his shoulder. ""It's not like you'll be missing much.""
""Thanks, sir. I think I'll go grab a bite to eat before turning in."" He had almost made it out of the room when a soft beeping noise made him pause. He turned around.
""Is that what I think it is?""
Salak'kor pointed to a pulsing green indicator. ""Yeah. It appears that the scanners have picked up something in the debris. Non-organic, though artifical in nature. Let's go see what it is, shall we?""
They walked through the twisting passageways of the ship. When they reached the aft airlock and donned their micro-light-drive acceleration suits. As they stepped out into open space and engaged their drives, G'rakh keyed his com system.
""Where we headed, sir?""
""Coordinates 302'045'-248"" came the Lieutenant's reply.
Despite himself, G'rakh could feel his hearts beat slightly faster.
*Finally, I get to get out of that cramped scanner room! * he thought, *I've been waiting far too long for something like this. *
A short while later, they arrived at the coordinates of the object the scanners picked up. The Lieutenant's voice came over the com system.
""We're looking for something small, light-pink colored, and around 10 *uk'rea* in length.""
""Roger that, sir"" G'rakh replied.
A few hours later they found what they were looking for. They put the object into a containment unit and headed back for the *Lek'vah*. Once aboard, they sterilized the object and began analyzing it.
""Do you have any idea what it is?"" asked Salak'kor.
""Not the faintest idea"" replied G'rakh. He picked up the object. It was long and cylindrical, with a raised section at one end terminating in a point, and two spheres affixed to the opposite end.
""It appears to be solid in its construction, comprised of a malleable synthetic material."" He sniffed it. ""Nothing unusual about the smell.""
He handed it over to Salak'kor, who took it by one end and shook it gently. The object wiggled back and forth.
""What could it be?""

"Everyone has experience a ""last straw"" moment.
This kid at work was the worst. I'm 23, he's 26, he acts like he's an immature 11-year-old.
We started out friendly. I would laugh at his jokes, I would humor him when he wanted to show me a youtube video. Then he started to try to show me porn at work, he started to boss me around even as it became evident I was already a better worker than he was. He bumped me when I was holding a knife a few times, I got small cuts.
I complained to management and they did nothing. I was starting to realize the type of place I worked for. He starts spraying me with the hose at night when we are cleaning up. After we close he follows me to my car and I have a hard time getting him to leave me alone so I can head home.
Days later he starts following me part of the way home. I was getting paranoid.
I asked for a few days off from work, I couldn't sleep at night, I was so angry at this guy, I wanted him to disappear off the face of the earth so badly.
I came back to work and there he was, joking around, blasting his anime music all shift long, doing it in front of the customers. Nobody would miss this guy if he was gone. Then I hatched my plan.
Next time he followed me home I would turn off my lights and sneak off and stop. Then I would wait for him to pass me, and slowly follow him from a distance for a while.
As he passed the hill right by the electrical plant I rammed him off the road right into the worst of it, sparks flew, I didn't see any movement and I drove off. I heard an explosion soon after and I felt no remorse.
When I got home I changed the tread on my tires and burned the old ones until there was nothing left.
In the news I read a story about a young man who tends to drink during his shifts at work and crashed into the electric plant by the hill. Evidence of alcohol containers were found in his car.
I started to like the feeling of having this guy out of my life for good. I liked knowing I ended him. Soon after our store closed (it was the crappiest store around), I decided to enlist.",0
"It took me a few weeks to piece together what had happened. I went to the police, filed the report, and collaborated with their investigation. Luckily, the nearby ATM caught the whole thing on camera, and I never was truly under any sort of suspicion.
As the man had no other ID, it was quite another effort to track down who he was. The bullet he fired, unfortunately disfigured most of his face, and this finger prints had been sanded off. I don't like thinking how much pain that must have caused, nor the insanity that would drive him, anyone really, to that level of desperation. I don't even know what he thought he was going to hide from by doing that.
I scanned the missing person's reports after the incident, expecting a friend or family member to be looking for someone with a similar physical description. He was a black male, mid twenties, about 5 foot 10, and medium build. He had a goatee, shaved head, and soulfully expressive eyes. There were tears in his eyes before he shot himself. The man had regrets. He had something or someone he had to leave behind. He had a place with someone somewhere. I tried to broaden the search and pull up all the missing people reports in other states and different years, but as I continue to go through them, I none have been a match so far.
I framed the card he handed to me. It is on my wall right now, above my desk in my home office. I don't know what this man did to get the card, but I am pretty sure he used it. Whatever it is, it isn't an ordinary card. I saw the name change. The letters moved and melded from his to mine. All I had time to see was a name, but it was gone before I could even read it. My guess is that this card is cursed, a magical relic from some time passed, with its own history of pain and torture being inflicted on its users. I tried cutting it up and throwing it out, but every day, it appears, intact, in my wallet, or pocket, jacket, or wherever. One time, it even showed up in my gym shoes. Most days it seems to stay in the case. It seems to be fine waiting there watching me watch it back. Other days it shows up in my pocket, wanting to tag along for the ride. So far though, it is staying with me.
I don't know how I know, but I know the card wants me to use it. I'm not a smart man, but I do know I am not going to do what it wants. I saw what happened to the previous guy. I know that this is a problem beyond me. That being said, this is the first time I can do something. My dad died because I wanted him to get me my special popsicle from the store--sideswiped by a drunk driver on the way back. Mom drank herself to death after that. My sister took care of me for a long while, not that I ever deserved it or made it easier for her. Wife left me when I slept with her sister. I never wanted to be with her sister, but she was there, I was drunk, and I let things happen. I have a kid out there now, without a dad.
In short, my life is a historical record of an unremarkable man who just hasn't risen to the occasion. Now I can. I don't know what this card is. I don't know what it does or why it does it. I do know that it will lead to my ruin, and any others after me. I am ending this though. So, for the rest of my life, the card will sit here with me for the rest of my life, utterly useless.
No one will ever find it. The curse will not be passed on to another. I am a friendless, isolated man, without a loved one in the world. It is a life I've entirely made for myself, and maintaining it is the best thing I can ever do for anyone else.

"To put it politely, today has been a long day. There are some other words I would add to that, but the promise of $200 dollars is hard to resist. Staying up all night to cram for the two hardest finals of my academic career (so far) was bad enough. Running into my ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend celebrating being done with finals when I tried to run into Quicki's for a snack between finals was bad enough. Getting urgent calls from my mom asking for $50 (that I don't have) in order to pay her phone bill in the middle of my second final was bad enough. Having all of that happen today, the last day of my stupid bet with Colin, was more than bad enough, but to make matters worse, ten feet from getting to my dorm and a well deserved nap, I stepped in doggie-doo.
All of that was bad enough, so when I opened the door to my dorm and heard a crowd of people shout, ""Happy birthday, Timothy!"" I was less than impressed. I stared the group down for a moment, my eyes glancing over their faces trying to see someone I recognized from a class or one of Colin's stupid clubs. No, these were fresh faces imported from Colin's jerkosphere of local friends.
""Sorry, wrong person guys. And maybe wrong room too. There's only me and Colin here,"" I said as politely as I could muster. Hopefully I had said that loud enough that they all got the message.
The man in front, a large, but lanky dude replied, ""What are you talking about Timothy? You don't want to celebrate your birthday?""
He had a mischievous grin on his face that I wanted to smack off. He lifted a bottle of Grey Goose and begin pouring shots for the whole room. I sighed, throwing off my shoes, careful to let the dog poo land on Colin's side and dropped my bag on my desk. At a glance, the amount of alcohol they had must have cost enough to add up to more than the $200 I would get once the clock struck midnight. But I knew Colin, he wasn't the type to lose, even if it meant blowing much more than we originally bid. I mean, the amount only got that high after we went double or nothing several times. Either way I wasn't planning on cursing before I got my money.
""It's a surprise you all fit in here,"" I muttered. Our room was supposed to be a quad, but both of our other roommates had conveniently dropped out midway through the semester to go find themselves together. I suppose it was possible they were actually looking for one of my ex-roommates.
""Hey, I don't know if Colin put you all up to this or something, but check it: Colin's out trying to hit it one last time before break, Chris is driving down Route 66 or something, and Joe's close behind. I'm Troy, I'm tired, and I'd love if you all took this outside.""
A pretty cut dude who felt comfortable wearing a tank-top and flip-flops, Boston's winter be damned, put an arm on my shoulder and said calmly, ""Hey man, we're here for you. Chill out and grab a drink. We're celebrating that's it's finally, the day.""
I really don't like being touched. Not at all. It's not like I was abused or anything, I just hate the feeling of another person touching me without notice. I shoved his arm off of me and said, ""Hey dude, that's great and all, but how about you find another dorm room to mess -""
""Tim, stop fucking around,"" a gorgeous blonde chick interrupted. Her voice was somewhere between heavenly and melodic. She grabbed my arm, and dragged me towards a futon. ""Finals are over. Drink up!""
My better judgement said this was a trap, but my sleep-deprived brain deferred to private first class on this one. I took the shot glass from her and mumbled something about them having the wrong guy, but decided I would have Colin's liquor and his money. There was a lot of cheering and hand-clapping when they realized I was going to be drinking as well. Good luck getting me to talk though.
""Let's get ratchet!"" some chubby dude in the corner screamed jumping on a desk.
""Yeah, you do that!"" I yelled back. All of my important stuff was already in storage. This was Colin's idea anyway and he was rich, right?
So for the next few hours we drank, ate pizza, and made way too much noise. It seemed like there was an intense debate on whether we should be playing poppy-stuff, heavy hip-hop, or some EDM music. Today was the last day of finals, so when they decided to just play all of it at once through Colin's ridiculous speakers, I had no complaints. Finals were over so no one else should be studying.
At about 9pm, enough people from the surrounding the rooms (the few who hadn't headed home already) had filtered into the room at least for a few minutes. Neither Colin nor I were huge party-throwers so it must have been a little surprising to our neighbors. I was too busy staring at blonde and gorgeous instead, so most of them had left as quickly as they had entered. They all had weird expressions on their faces, but I was too busy convincing Emily (that was her name) that taking jello shots off of her was a great idea to try and make them more comfortable. I didn't have any jello, but I'm not always the most logical when I'm 6 shots in.
""Bro, what the hell is going on?"" someone said from behind me. There were at least 30 people in the room and I only cared about one of them at the moment.
""What do you think, dip- … genius?"" Close one.
The angry voice became an angry pair of hands pulling me away from Emily and the tequila shots I was planning to take off of her belly. I had never done that before and I really wanted to punch whoever decided to stop me from expanding horizons -
""What do you want Colin?"" I said realizing who my antagonist was.
""What do I want? Fifty-three drunk people out of my room would be nice to start.""
I assumed that more people had wandered in over the course of the night. Colin was usually annoyingly precise with his estimates. I assumed it was something all rich people could do. ""Excuse me rich boy. I'm sorry that YOU decided to get a bunch of people in here to get me to curse, but I'm enjoying it a lot at this point so how about you fu-find somewhere else to bi-blow your steam. I thought you'd be chasing Julie's tail by now and -""
""Rich boy?"" Colin looked pretty confused by my behavior. It's not like either of us had seen me this drunk in the two years we'd been roommates. ""Dude, you've had way too much. I don't even know where to…""
He sighed deeply before continuing, ""Anyway, Julie is...look neither of us had a chance is all I can say. Now can you get your friends out of here? I really just want to pack and get some sleep. I need to.""
""I don't know any of these people,"" I said, feeling the night catch up to me. ""They're you're friends, right? Or Anthony or Timothy's or whatever. Just quit it. This bet has gone too far.""
""Bet? Are you still talking about that? I Venmo'd you this morning. That's been over for hours right? Is that what this is about? You wanted to blow the $200 on a party?""
I looked at my phone and checked Venmo. Yeah, I had two hundos from Colin McAvery for ""cleaning up your potty mouth."" Ah. Then who were these people? I grabbed a girl with a pug nose walking by by the wrist. I'd be sure to scold myself for being so handsy tomorrow, but for now I asked. ""Who's Timothy?""
She giggled the ways girls who've had too much are wont to do and said, ""You silly. Don't worry. We'll be ready soon.""
Colin glanced at me, but before he could ask the question I wanted to, the door to our room closed with a bang. All of the lights turned off, save Joe's old mood candle. And then everyone was holding candles. And then the all the music stopped save some heavy southern trap. And then I noticed there was a table in the center of the room. And then I noticed that everyone was chanting. And then the lanky guy from before threw my RA on the table, naked. And then someone pulled out a long knife with a serrated edge and handed to it gorgeous.
""Happy birthday, Timothy!"" Emily said to raucous cheers before bringing the blade down on Kyle's chest.

"We humans were always interested in finding alien life among the stars. Maybe it was out of curiosity, to see what else laid before us among the stars. Maybe it was out of a fear of being alone in the universe. What ever it was, what ever purpose we had for searching, had led us to this. This was the fate of humanity.
I think it is 9:00, 9:30? Who knows what time it currently is, let alone whether it was dusk or dawn. Every time I wake up, I hope that what happened was just a really, really messed up dream, and every time it is the same as the day before. Still shackled to this metal plate, while they pump the blood from my veins to fuel their addictions. Fortunately, I am O+. That means that they don't just squeeze me dry and discard my corpse like some sort of twisted version of a capri-sun. But instead, they just take a couple of liters at a time, allowing me to enjoy my misery until I ""expire"" like a carton of milk. Maybe it is because of the rarity of my blood. That's probably why. They don't just keep humans alive for this long for no reason. All I know is that my blood is the most potent, the most expensive, the most enjoyable and the most precious blood type in the known galaxy.
Sure, it is illegal for them to do this but this place just falls short of the federation's border. That means any human here is fair game. Or maybe this place is within the border, yet again, lets not get any hopes up. The chances of being rescued is minimal. I try to move into a more comfortable position, yet all this does is cause a sharp pain to ripple through my ribs, signifying that I have triggered the pumps to start doing their job. As my vision starts to clear, I am greeted with the familiar sight of various clear tubes, filled with blood, running out of my abdomen and off to a large pipeline where our blood is sent off to God knows where.
Every time I wake up, I don't say every day as there is no way of telling the time in this place, I turn my head to the left and right to see how my fellow ""cattle"" are doing. And every time I am greeted to the same sight. Columns of people hooked up to this infernal machine, sucking them dry with every passing second. Millions of them, if not thousands, in eternal pain.
But something was off. Not as many people where dying and being released into the depths of the facility to be disposed of. Instead, it seemed like the pump was slowing down, as the shooting pain had dulled. The usually high pitched whir of the pump had changed to slow hum. Then a loud crackling came over the loud speaker.
""Attention,"" stated a commanding voice. It seemed to be coming from every where as there was no source which I could tell the voice was coming from.
""This is Sergeant Umanda of The Federation.""
""This facility is in violation of the ""Extraction Amendment of the Homosapien Species"" and has condemned this facility to destruction. Those who are operating this facility will be incinerated. Anyone who is still alive to hear this, don't worry. Your suffering will soon come to an end.""
Typical Federation. Even they treat us like anima-",0
"Sergeant Clark lifted his wrist to look at the band wrapped around it. It was no different than the fitness trackers people wore, except that it was reinforced by thick ropes of steel. It looked boring, actually. Black, some kind of supple rubber. A little digital heart pulsed consistently beside of a number that read 96. A cold blade of panic pierced his back, shooting a chill up his neck and across his scalp. He swallowed against an entirely too-dry throat, feeling the tissue scrape across itself like sandpaper. The sensation gagged him and he had to suppress his body's reflex to retch.
He managed to tear his eyes from his own wrist to a face concealed by a mask without contour or color. ""You have 60 seconds. If your heart still beats after, the nuclear bombs will launch. It doesn't matter what countries will be hit. What matters is the one that fired them. The USA.""
It was strange where his mind went as he targeted the stranger with the barrel of his gun. He thought of how he'd never have a dog. His parents would never let him have one of his own growing up and life had never given him the opportunity to bring one into his life as an adult, between never having an apartment that allowed him as he failed out of college, and all of the travel required by his secret career. He didn't think of Lucy or his mom. He thought of this dog, that probably would have been brown and white or something and ate its own vomit. He would've named it Daniels, because Jack would've raised some brows with the reputation Sergeant Clark had made for himself.
Hands numb, he lowered the barrel of his gun. The number on the wristband was nearing 200. He felt disconnected from his body other than his nose, which was ice cold. He closed his eyes and smiled. He didn't know what was funny, but he couldn't deny that something was. He relaxed his shoulders, let the rifle fall slack on its strap across his chest, and pulled his pistol from its holster on his hip. The metal should've been cold against his temple, but he wouldn't have noticed it had it not been for the determined pressure of it. Almost forgetting them, Sergeant Clark turned to face his squad. Why? He wasn't sure. Maybe to say he was sorry. Maybe to thank them for his time with them the last five years. Maybe it was so the last thing he saw before he died was a familiar face, if not a friend.
Instead, what he saw was the barrels of five guns with highly trained fingers on the triggers. He was glad he couldn't see their eyes.
Sergeant Clark holstered his pistol in a practiced, mechanical movement and gave a short nod that was both an order, a pardon, and an apology all at the same time.

"""Shit.""
Dr. Sam Heinz ran into the emergency room, and smelled the patient before she saw them. She knew that smell, cloyingly sweet with metallic undertones. It affected the stomach in a curious way; you could feel the scent more than you could smell it. It was not a good feeling.
She rushed to the side of the gurney, pushing past the nurses who busied themselves trying to get the patient to breathe. Time seemed to slow down as Sam looked down at him, and he looked up into her eyes.
His skin was blanched and had an ever slight unnatural green tint, almost imperceptible in the glaring lights of the ER. Hie eyes were sunken into his face, rimmed in black and bloodshot, oh, so bloodshot. His lips were curled back in an unintended grin, his gums swollen over his teeth. Blood seeped through his teeth in a thick bubbling stream, oozing thick from his nostrils. He made no sound other than a soft gurgling as he tried to breathe. His jaw was clenched tight and his pupils were wide and delirious. They darted around the room, unseeing, before briefly meeting with Sam's. There was no recognition, no acknowledgement. Then his eyes rolled randomly in their sockets. They moved independent of each other.
Sam snapped back to her senses. ""Everyone listen to me! All of you need to get out of her RIGHT NOW!""
It took a moment for the activity in the room to lull as the nurses looked towards her. The nurses were stopped mid-activity. No one made a move to leave.
""Goddamn you, LEAVE! You can't stay here -""
Sam was interrupted by a loud wheezing noise, and she whirled to face the patient in horror. He had elevated his back off the gurney by his neck and feet, and he inhaled air violently, with his hands at his throat. His chest expanded as his lungs filled with air - bigger, bigger, BIGGER. Sam tried to scream for everyone to run, but it was too late.
The man dropped back down, before shooting up to a sitting position. With no warning, he expelled the air from his lungs with a scream. At least, it would've been a scream, but it obfuscation was by the blood in his oesophagus. This blood and saliva sprayed out into the room in thick globs and a fine mist; the miniscule particles floating through the air to land on everyone in the room. The man stopped screaming and slumped forward on himself, before sliding limply off the gurney.
Sam, covered in gore, dropped to her knees in resignation. It was too late. It was all too late. They were all infected. She didn't know with what, but they'd all be dead within three days. They'd die the same way this man did. They'd die the same way her husband did, just a day after returning from his year-long service on the International Space Station. They'd die like her daughter did, two days ago.
She was going to die with them, but she knew this before she even walked into the hospital today. The only reason she came was to find a way to save herself. But it was all just...too...late.
She could already smell it in her skin. That sweet, gut curdling scent that smelled like nothing else on earth.",0
"Look, if you're going to cut down an alley in this part of town dressed like that, I consider it a personal favor that someone as non-violent as myself is going to teach you this life lesson. I launch into Act 1 of our little two-man show, and I have to say that Mr. Fancy really shone in his role as set-upon victim; I didn't have to put up with any tough-guy bullshit, but he wasn't some blubbering, pants-wetting mess that I had to coach through the whole process either. You can tell this guy's been mugged before, and he has that polite, detached let's-conclude-this-transaction-quickly demeanor that I really appreciate in a mark. I think to myself that everything's going ol' Lucky's way if a man who's in this tight with my boy Benjamin Franklin decided he didn't have the patience to wait for that Uber like everyone else. I'm about to wrap things up, but his hand is lingering a little protectively around that right pocket and my intuition starts nagging me that maybe we're operating with different understandings of the word ""empty"". Now you don't need to explain to me about honor among thieves, but it does rustle my jimmies a mite when I'm doing my level best to keep this a polite and professional experience and the mark thinks he's going to get clever on me. I present a convincing argument as to the merits of my empty pockets policy to Mr. Fancy in the form of a few right crosses, and he hands me a thumb drive. If he's willing to buy tickets to my chin music festival for it, I'm thinking its probably got some financials on it, or maybe a performance art piece he did with the missus. Either way, you bet your ass I'm checking it out. I leave him zip-tied to the dumpster like usual and stroll back home to count my money per the sage advice of the warrior poet Kenny Rogers.
Back home I say hello to Roachy and the boys as they skitter under the fridge, and I review my haul on the kitchen counter with the assistance of a cold can of Nasty Light. It'll keep the lights on anyway, maybe with a little left over to sock away in my equine investment portfolio down at the track. I figure I'll check the thumb drive to see if I maybe hit the Powerball, so I pop it in the ol' porn box and load the drive. One measly.exe file, and I've opened too many of those from Russian models who want much sexytime to fall for that again. A little disappointed, I toss it and turn my thoughts to how I'm going to convince Snake tomorrow that this Rolex is a no-shitter.
I flip on the TV and some fine-ass blonde is perched above the scroller talking about terrorism, and I'm just about to flip it over to Cartoon Network when what do I see but some security camera footage of me and Mr. Fancy having our little tete-a-tete. Shit. He must have been some kind of something if taking his lunch money is worth throwing my mug up on cable news. I develop a sudden interest in national security, and turn up the volume. Apparently Mr. Fancy was some Chinese agent moonlighting as a Pentagon IT muckety-muck who was on his way to take down the nation's energy grid with his trusty thumb drive. The talking heads are on the screen now speculating wildly as to the identity of this masked hero and the current whereabouts of the thumb drive. I cast a nervous glance at the trash can, but as of now it appears that the only one with any pressing interest in it is Roachy.
----------
The CIA denies involvement, but of course that's what they'd say, so everybody--to include the CIA--seems to be content with the narrative that they cracked this one and everything's under control. Soon the nation moves on after an escaped gorilla is shot by a Syrian immigrant cop at a Black Lives Matter rally. Me, I'm still just a small-time hustler running game. You're welcome, America.",0
"He ran his fingertips across the smooth surface of the picture. He poured another glass of whiskey, not bothering with the ice any more. In the dim light, it was hard to distinguish his facial features. His hooked nose protruded the shade cast over his face by the baseball cap he had on, 2 sizes too small.
""It would have been his tenth birthday today."" He finally broke the silence, his words slurred and his breathe burnt in my eyes. I had lost track of the amount of sips he had taken from the bottle labelled 'The famous Grouse', but judging from the bottle and the empty ones in the corner, I assume he's had his fair share. ""After I lost my wife, he was all I have left."" He took a long, hard sip from the bottle, he didn't bother to fill his glass any more. When his sentence came to a halt I recognised this man's voice.
*6 months ago*
""Yo man, just drive."" Jerome said, his face was covered in blood, the wound on his face didn't look like it planned on stopping the constant stream of fresh blood, pulsing at every heartbeat. ""What the hell did they want, man?"" My head was cleared a few moments ago by the stream of adrenaline, but I could feel that I was still fairly inebriated. ""I don't know man, and I don't want to stick around to find out"" Fair point, I thought to myself. As the alcohol in my blood was slowly winning against the adrenaline shooting through my body, I ran a red light. I jolted the steering wheel to the left, as to avoid the traffic. I lost control of the car, brakes where screeching, people were screaming until we came to a halt in the front garden of a small suburban house. ""Fuck! Jerome, you okay?"" I started ""Go man, no time to stick around!"" I backed the car out of the driveway and manoeuvred our way through the small crowd of people that started to gather. ""My boy! What have you done to my child?"" An unknown voice cried as I accelerated away from what just unfolded. No more drinking before 8, I thought to myself.
*present*
""Do you remember me?"" The suddenly all too familiar man sobbed. ""Do you know what you've done?"" The man stood up and got his gun off the shelves. I tried to talk to him, explain what went on, apologise, but the duct tape taped around my mouth stopped any words from forming. He grabbed the back of my head, I tried to fight him off but my arms and legs were badly bruised and taped to the chair I was positioned in. ""So you understand what has to happen now...""
CLICK. He cocked his revolver, the spring sounded rusty and the barrel hesitant. I was screaming my lungs out, the tape obscured my words and muffled the sound. I heard the trigger being pulled. I was overwhelmed by the feeling of peace as the light slowly crept out of my eyes, my senses slowly faded as my consciousness extinguished.
*** I started writing about something entirely different, but this came out. Fairly new to this, would love some criticism. I feel like I should have described the environment and ambience a bit more, but I don't think I should edit a story I already posted (this being the edit the star next to my name indicates) ***",0
"She's got this feeling at the back of her neck, like there's a slug dribbling down the nubs of her spine, sliming over her skin from hairline to shoulder blades, and it won't *stop*. It's been there since she left Prague, making her face contort and her fingers curl in every conversation. She's sure she looks like a pig.
It fades sometimes, like during the meeting in Berlin and the conference in Brussels, when she can occupy herself with the humdrum activities of global parliamentary management, but then she sees one more ""Gitti for the United Republic!"" poster and the slug is back, filming over her skin, making her feel like she needs a shower, making her feel like she's going to be sick.
Victoria Gitti will never go down in history as the woman who demolished the republic, but only because they won't remember the word republic when she's done with them. They won't remember democracy either, or history, and they certainly won't remember Representative Dou Mei Li of the Beijing Corporation, who might consider taking off a layer of her own skin with a fish knife if meant getting to sleep at night. But Victoria, with her bright smile and perfect rainbow of suits, her voice like the old American movie stars'— she'll be remembered. Mei Li can see it in the way her smile pinches at the corners, the way she moves when she's not on camera. Mei Li, with her seat just behind the dignitaries from New York and London, has seen it herself, how Victoria acts like she's the only person of any importance in the world. She'd say it baffles her, how the lambs appear to fawn over the wolf, but times are bad. Times are worse than they've been in a long time, and Victoria Gitti is the most charismatic of many evils.
Mei Li is in Beijing, in her offices, and her PA is on the vidscreen, asking her about a call from Representative Correa. Mei Li waves it on.
Correa looks grim, backlit by a smoky orange light barely diffused by the fine curtains of his home office. ""Good morning, Representative Dou,"" he says in Mandarin, stony faced.
""Andreas,"" she replies, returning to her paperwork. ""I think I know why you called.""
""You're the last vote on the Cities Conglomerate, Mei Li,"" he says, dropping all pretenses. When she raises her eyes to the vidscreen, he looks wretched. There's a bruise forming across one cheekbone and he's down to his shirtsleeves. He must have been out in the riots, trying to stop his constituents from doing anything rash. She doesn't envy him. It may be her turn soon enough. ""We need you for a unanimous vote, and we need a unanimous vote to ensure she has the mandate. We can't risk dissension on this, you understand? We need her to be legitimate.""
Mei Li snorts and sets her pen against the desk. ""Gitti doesn't need us. She doesn't even like us. And I sincerely doubt she requires our endorsement to win. She doesn't seem like the kind of woman to subscribe to the whole 'separation of powers' idea.""
""Now, come on,"" Andreas begins, image momentarily pixelating as the light behind him flares red, ""you can't possibly believe those crackpots, she's not about to—""
""She *ran* on it, Andreas!"" Mei Li shouts, suddenly furious. She's standing now, fists planted against the desk, and the vidscreen's camera tracks her up. ""Were you not around two days ago, did your translator suddenly give out? She said 'we cannot let the squabbling of the few drown out the cries of the many.' She said 'a diffused government is a weak government.' Andreas, she fucking said 'the die has been cast'! She's going to dissolve the URC and assume a very likely indefinite state of emergency, and if you can't see that then god help you, Representative.""
She breathes for a moment and Andreas stares, mouth forming inchoate shapes as he scrabbles for a reply. The office outside her door has gone entirely quiet.
""You don't know that,"" Andreas manages, finally. Mei Li shakes her head, already preparing a reply, but he continues over her, voice suddenly pleading, ""No, you don't know that! Maybe she's just trying to attract the hardliners, or the Mediterranean neocons. She's not about to become the next Ceaser, Mei Li, she's a good woman, she wouldn't do that.""
""And you know this how?"" Mei Li shoots back, though she can feel the anger draining out of her. The slug once more begins its ponderous slide down her neck.
""I—I don't know,"" Andreas returns, no longer meeting her eyes. ""But it's like you said, she doesn't need us to win. She's the only choice we have, and I have to believe she's the right one. We're falling apart. We need a strong hand.""
Mei Li slumps back into her seat, breath gone from her lungs. She can't be mad at Andreas, though she should be. You can't blame the wolf for killing, in a certain morbid way, but every lamb that lets it into their pasture is a damn fool.
There's a low susurrus growing outside her door. Her staff must be gathered around her PA's computer, watching the feed. Andreas has found the balls to look at her, obviously waiting for some confirmation, some validation of his cowardice.
""Have you ever heard the saying, 'May you live in interesting times?""' she asks, voice clear in airy room. ""It's the first of three ancient Chinese curses, each of increasing severity. May you live in interesting times, may you come to the attention of those in authority, and, worst of all, may you find exactly what you are looking for.""
""I—really?"" Andreas starts, confused by the subject change. ""I've never heard of any such curses.""
""Well, that's probably because they were made up by some English twat back in the 1930's,"" Mei Li replies, leaning forward. She taps an icon on the vidscreen, and her contacts folder open, pushing Andreas to a corner of the screen. ""But you know, I think he had the right idea. May you find exactly what you're looking, Andreas. I resign. The vote is unanimous. Long live the king.""
She cuts the feed before he can reply. One frame remains on screen, his face just beginning to twist as he processes her declaration, the fires behind him so close she can each lick of flame outlined through the curtains, but she quickly closes out. She prints off a list of addresses, grabs her coat, and throws open her office door.
Her entire stuff is, indeed, gathered outside. Not a one of them has the decency to look shamefaced, which she appreciates in aspiring young politicos. She tosses the list to her PA and announces, voice booming, ""For the next two weeks you do not sleep. You do not eat. You do not blink unless I give the OK. Gitti comes to power in 15 days, so we've got 14 days and 23 hours to get our hands on every scrap of China we can and put it somewhere she'll never find it. That list is addresses of historians, academics, community leaders, journalists, and artists. We're going to find them, and we're going to enlist them.""
One staffer raises her hand, an intern by the fear in her eyes, and Mei Li nods to her. ""Uh,"" she quavers, slightly shaky in the face of Mei Li's sudden will, ""do we still work for you? What with the resigning and all.""
Mei Li pauses, and after a moment, laughs. ""No,"" she replies, smiling at her own bluster, ""I suppose you don't. So I suppose instead I'll have to ask you."" She pans around the room, meeting each staffer's eye and says, with sincerity, ""What you heard was real. I'm not crazy, and I'm not paranoid. Gitti will dismantle the Republic in a matter of months and the world will bend to her vision. She will scar the global culture for generations. But,"" Mei Li says, and smiles again, with more teeth. ""We are Chinese. What we are, we have been for longer than generations. We do not lose contests of time. With your help, Gitti will find nothing we do not want her to find. With your help, we will outlast her. Sound good?""
The staffers, young and stupidly idealistic to a man, cheer. Mei Li smiles back and begins doling out tasks, assigning districts and universities and museums to scour. It won't really help, she knows. Dictators have a way of enforcing homogeneity, not to mention obedience. She will likely be dead within the year, her name erased, but perhaps it won't be for nothing. The slug inches its way between her shoulder blades, but it's faint, and easily ignored.",0
"Mr. Robert E. Haynes was anything but a stereotypical 10th grade history teacher. He knew his material, didn't coach any sports, and he sure as hell never ended up behind the wheel of a school bus.
One day I was walking through the flea market in a small town in Alabama when a peculiar painting caught my eye. Mr. Haynes was depicted standing in full Confederate uniform with a saber by his side.
Then it hit me. Mr. Haynes was Robert E. Lee. Now I know what you're thinking, there's no way. But all the little details started to make sense. He spent almost 3 entire months on the Great War of Northern Aggression. He talked about the war like he was there and lost friends on the battlefield.
Over time I lost interest in my discovery, and I moved on to failing bigger and better classes than history.
But I'll never forget my 10th grade Confederate General.",0
"She wasn't much of a looker. One eye was kind of bigger than the other, so it bulged a little bit and looked like she was staring at you funny. Her nose was crooked too, but she used to tell me she'd done it herself by running into a chest of drawers. She didn't like the way it was before. Rose took up smoking when I was eleven and she was sixteen, because a boy in a leather jacket had pulled a lighter out of his pocket and slicked his hair back in a way which I would never learn how to do.
""I don't like it when you do that."" I'd grumbled, feet hanging off the ground.
""I don't give a shit, sonny. I'm special."" She drawled, and she was right. There it was, the little 'X' on the back of her neck, standing out like someone had sharpied it onto her skin. She was meant for something great.
That evening, Rose and I sat in front of the TV. She stank like mint, overpoweringly strong. There was no mistaking her new habit, but I remember Dad letting it slide. She was meant for something special, something great. She couldn't die yet. On the flickering screen, a man with black hair raised his hand over the small bible before a crowd hung in suspense.
*"" I do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully execute the Office of the President of the United..."" *
When he turned his back to the camera the cross stood out against his white neck.
It was four am and the sound of buzzing woke me. I crept to the bathroom, floorboards creaking.
""Go back to bed.""
Rose was standing in front of the mirror, Dad's electric razor in her hand and long curls of blonde hair tailing over the corner of the sink.
""What are you doing?""
""I want people to see,"" she hissed. ""I'm not like you!""
""You look stupid.""
The floor had been cold under my feet, but it was nothing compared to the look in her eyes when she turned around to glare at me.
""What would you know?"" She sneered. ""You're a nobody. You're not special. You will never amount to anything.""
------
The roads had been wet for about a week. I'd been watching raindrops chase each other down the smeared window of the beat-up old car. Rose got to sit in the front seat and Dad was struggling with a stick-shift, gears grinding and wheels sliding.
""You excited about seeing Grandma?"" He asked, turning round and beaming at me. Rose's ears stuck out from her shaved head, patches of blonde fluff just starting to crop up again around her ears. Dad was going to make her wear a hat when we got there.
But we didn't. The wheels of the car skidded and Dad swore. The tiny car lurched and skidded, Rose wailing and gripping the dashboard with white knuckles as we hit the barrier of the road.
I don't remember much. The water was cold and heavy and we started to sink immediately. Later they told me Dad's leg had got trapped under the gearstick. Rose had broken the passenger window with her elbow. She'd flayed the skin to her shoulder, they said. They didn't let me see her again for a while and when I did her hair was just beginning to get long, peeping over the corner of the white-collared shirt the hospital had given her.
She sat on the end of my bed and picked nervously at the scabs on her red, raw arm until they broke and soft red blood began flowing.
""You saved me,"" I said nervously. The end of my sentence hung in the air between us.
""I quit smoking.""
""You did?""
She swept her hair aside and showed me the back of her neck, smooth and clear as if the cross had never been there.
""Turns out you only get one great act."" She said sadly.
""One was enough.""
She looked up. Cuts and bruises littered her face. She wasn't much of a looker. But Rose was great.",0
"A change of clothing, canned tuna, a loaded revolver, and a full tank of gas on his red '76 Mustang Cobra, that's all Thomas needed to start a new life.
He revved up the engine and drove west, out to face his destiny.
As he drove out of town, he passed through a lot of places where he grew up. He passed the old arcade where he once spent $5 in quarters just placing with his friends from sun up to sun down, caring only about beating each other's high-scores. He drove by his old elementary where he once starred as ""the wolf"" in his class play of The Little Red Riding Hood when he was 8. He drove by the carpentry shop where he and friend got their first job.
None of this mattered to him anymore; all ties to the past have been severed. Thomas did not look and reminisce at the memories he was leaving behind. All he could do is look forward and think about the future. Whatever it held for him, his past had nothing to do with it.
As he drove up a hill and down the other side, his old life, his old town faded from the rear view mirror. Thomas not once looked back, not even when making a lane change.",0
"""I'm flattered."" right after I got hit by a huge truck, a male figure with black wings entered my field of vision.
""Handsome as always, Azrael."" I stood up, ignoring my broken body. ""May I ask, what in this humble human's act that flatter you?""
""Never before a human took the phrase *'flirting with death'* quite literally like you, Miss Reinia."" Azrael smiled. ""Well, it's not like I dislike your attention. So, this is third time this month, how long do you plan to stay?""
I laughed sourly ""You know full well that no matter how much I like your company, I won't let myself got hit by a truck intentionally.""
""There's no way to know if it's you, Reinia."" a tinge of mischief glittered in his eyes. ""So, care to join me for an evening tea?""
""It's exactly noon though.""
""Who cares? This place has no time, after all.""
I followed him into one of the open doors, it was supposed to be a small cafe, but the interior was far larger than the exterior permits. ""One of the perks of being Death's best friend."" I muttered unconsciously, gaining his attention.
""Having an inflatable cafe?""
""Having no competition would be more appropriate."" his laugh filled the white marble chamber.
""Trust me, I'm quite popular in the another world.""
""True, everyone in the underworld should've seen you at least once.""
""Another joke you could only say to Death."" we both sipped on our tea, and for a while only silence ensues.
""Even so, it's a truck this time, huh. Must be in the top ten of my painful experience.""
""Out of curiosity, what is the number one painful experience you had?""
""Every single second I spend separated from you."" I smirked, Azrael scratched his head.
""Well, imagine how painful would it be when your death actually come.""
""Ah..."" that's right, this white world isn't the Realm of Death, but merely the closest part where the World of the Living and the Realm of Death intersect, the place souls have to pass after dying.
""I'm sorry, that was in a bad taste."" Azrael fidgeted.
""No problem."" I sipped my tea agan.
""Say, Reinia?""
""Yes?""
""If you could stay here forever, would you discard everything in your world?""
I startled ""That...I can't answer that question...I'm sorry, Azrael. That question is not one I could answer.""
""But why?""
""Azrael...""
""I thought we loved each other, I thought even if you don't plan it, you actually wish we could meet again, I thought that even if it's painful, as long as you could be in my side...""
He fell silent.
""Death. It's not your name that I feared, nor the being that you are, nor the inevitability of your arrival.""
""I'll return you to your body. It might be a bit painful, but your condition has stabilized.""
""Wait! Listen, it's not because of you that I cannot answer your question.""
""Death should have no business with those that still have the will to live. Death has no right to detain souls that destined to live on. Death should never..."" a tears dropped from my eyes as I embraced his being.
""It's not because I don't love you, that I cannot remain in this world...""
""Death should never let itself fall in love with beings it cannot reach."" a bright light blinded my eyes as I woke up in the hospital room.
""You're wrong."" I whispered. ""It was I who never deserves to fall in love with you."" tears flowed through my scarred face.
In a realm neither of the Death nor the Living, a black-winged being floats in the emptiness.
""I should have never shown myself in front of you."" it whispered, its black wings expanded to fill the vast whiteness.",0
"The Moon, a Crack, and Conspiracies
(Critiques and other comments greatly encouraged)
""Aliens. I knew it."" Paul said immediately.
It has been at least ten minutes since we saw this giant slit in the moon…
everyone in the town is here, and I would imagine everyone everywhere in the world is looking. Before the moon got a new hole, there was a
massive tear sound echoing through my entire town. We all ran out of our
homes, our stores, our bars… like I said everyone's out here.
""You think the media is gonna report this?"" I said to Paul.
""Naw, they ain't doin'shit about this… and if they are, sure as hell not
gonna be the truth.""
In the background, you can see cops just coming into town, stopping and
looking straight up at the moon. I look back, and Jones is going back into
Harry's, probably the get his hands on some free liquor. Wendy and her
two young kids have stopped on the side. her three-year old keeps pointing his chubby fingers at the moon. The crack is… unsettling, almost
like a chasm to the abyss.
""In fact,"" Paul continues, ""I bet the government have somethin'to do with
this. Read somewhere that they're harvestin'the power of the sun and
weaponizin'it. Sure as hell they're gonna transfer it over to the moon,
and shoot it outta this crack, destroyin'enemies we have in Korea, Iran,
Taiwan.""
""We don't have enemies in Taiwan, Paul."" I stop and think… yeah I
should've addressed that last...right after addressing the rest of that
bullshit.
""Don't matter, man. Point is, if we have enemies, they gonna get it now.
Shoot, maybe they'll start with all the enemies at home first.""
I stop and look over to the left. Denise and her pretty, flowery white dress
is over starring at the moon with that asshole Jack. Old Viveca has had
too much of all the commotion and is, I can only imagine, walking back to
her house.
I begin to remember something. ""Didn't Randy's grandpa go to the moon
once? Long time ago?""
""Sure did, proudest thing that has come out of this town.""
""Shouldn't we talk to him? See if he knows something?""
""Don't see why not.""
So Paul and I leave the commotion… my mind deciding whether I want to
think about Wendy or Denise tonight when I get home.
We turn to walk through Randy's dirt driveway leading to his farm, and I
knock on his door. Randy's face peaks out…. I can tell he's visibly shaken.
""Randy,"" I said. ""You saw the moon didn't you?""
""What do you think? Whole fuckin'town's seen it, Vince.""
""Well, we figured your grandpa went to the moon once… figured you
might know a little bit more about it than us?""
""My bet's Aliens… or government weapons."" Paul says.
""My grandpa and his team went to burry something in the moon… never
said what… but all he said was it's bad… like real bad… like deep shit bad.""
""Tell us all you know, Randy."" I say. ""We're interested.""
""Won't do much good… all I can say is, the entire world is in some deep shit.""
Randy opens to the door more, we step in and talk for a few hours….. turns out… maybe everybody's time on earth is about to get real shorter…",0

Now to say hello to my mother.
""hello Mom""
A) did you sleep well?
B) Whats for breakfast?
C) can i have 5 money? (Requires level 15 speech skill)
let's go with A
""Mom, what's for breakfast?""
""Sweety, there's a cereal in the pantry.""
""OK. Thanks.""
After this i seemed to lose control of my body as i went through the motions of getting cereal, and eating an entire bowl in five seconds.
But the stat buff was worth it.
Now it was time to walk to school.
Checking my map to see where it was just in case, i began my journey.
""Damn, the road takes me around this mountain. Ain't nobody got time fo dat!""
I spent three times the necessary amount of time trying to get over the mountain. After 3 respawns i finally managed it.
I arrived at school, and went to my locker. But i hadn't written down my code.
""Damn, i need some picks to open this novice lock. I'll bet there are some in this trash can!""
*Lockpicks (5) added to inventory*
I then set upon picking the lock, and removing my textbooks, and going to class.
I opened my math book, and blam! *Math skill upgraded to level 15*
Then it was time for science. *Science skill upgraded to level 13*
Then gym. We were doing laps around the school. After sprinting for half of my stamina bar i let myself recharge a bit by jogging, and then sprinting again. I was in first place.
Then we ate lunch.
*picked up potatoes (87), carrots (50), and tomatoes (60).
Time stopped as i spent a few seconds wolfing down all of that, except for the tomatoes. Might need those later. The fall damage from my time on the mountain was gone now.
After my afternoon classes and various buffs to Speech, Chemistry, and Diction, i began my way home.
I only needed to respawn twice this time.
After getting home i ran into my brother. He said he wanted to fight. For practice.
I equipped my hands, and readied them. I swung left, then right, then left, then right, used a power attack. I was hit by a left-left, right-right, and then a power attack. I began to lose. My Hp was low.
I knew what i had to do! I went into my inventory, and devoured the tomatoes!
My Hp was full now, and i won the fight.
We shook hands, and went to eat dinner. My brother could replenish his Hp there.
After dinner i saved my progress, and went to bed.
I slept for exactly 8 hours, and woke up the next day completely awake, and with a ""Well rested"" Stat buff.",0
"I have always been careful. ALWAYS. How the HELL did I get caught?!
I struggle against my straps, not even noticing when someone comes in. Man I'm getting sloppy...or rusty...hmm rusted blades, there's an idea...
The person speaks, it's a woman? ""I have been watching you for some time...""
That canNOT be good. So I turn on the charm. ""Oh really? Well I wish you would've shown yourself, maybe I could watch you~"" and wiggle my eyebrows. Yeah, weird, but ladies seem to be easier drawn when guys are FUNNY rather than too flirty.
She huffs a breath. ""I...I can't let you out of your straps just yet. Not. Not yet."" She hacks a cough into her elbow. Ew. Germs.
She stands up a little straighter. ""Does the name Ricardo mean anything to you?""
I had to search through my aliases before it clicked: I had, of course, a family. Ricardo was my older brother. He was...kinda good. Wasn't abusive, didn't drink too often.
However, just last year he was shot and killed by a very well-known mob boss.
They couldn't arrest him, especially when I doused out my own brand of justice.
Heh. Doused.
After a moment, I nodded slowly. ""What about it?""
She hacked a cough, and I could see the speckled blood. ""I...I was in love. And we were going to be married soon. I got pregnant, and well, had his baby. However, he died before the baby was even born.""
Oh. *Oh*. I'm...an uncle? My brother was a *father*? What...
She coughed out a sob. ""I have end-stage lung cancer, due to not smoking but from an infection in a not very well sterilized operation room. I don't have long to live. I know you're his brother you look just like him!""
She came closer. She was a...pleasant woman. Wavy locks of brown, deep brown eyes. Plump cheeks. She was nice.
I knew what she was asking of me, why she couldn't ask our parents. They were long dead.
She hovered over my straps, and I nodded. She undone me, and I sat up. ""May I see the child?""
She nodded with tears in her eyes, and whisked up something out of the crib nearby. She tilted the babe. She, and it was a she, had curled black hair like my brother. Sleeping.
The mother sniffed. ""I know you...kill people. And I know some may find that reprehensible, but honestly I also know how you are with kids, how your brother was. I have faith in you.""
I agreed. I loved kids. I would love this niece of mine, this daughter of my brother.
I gently took her away, understanding when the mother's arms tightened even for a moment before relaxing.
She gave me instructions: feedings with formula, or the milk in the fridge. I could take it all home, along with the crib and the toys and anything.
Finally, she stood stock still, a woman with a plan. ""I can't suffer any longer. Would you...?""
I nodded again, and gently covered the little girl in my arms, moving the blanket over the tiny, tiny ears.
She left.
I knew what she was going to do, and so I went outside, and I coddled my new found family.
And I waited.
I gathered up the child's belongings, made it seem like, say, a kidnapping, then put in a 911 saying that someone was shot.
I left.
The child, her name was Keke. A wonderful name.
I think I'll stop killing, just...just for a while. So I can get in the swing of things with her...just a little while...",0
"2:23 P.M.
The exact time I will die.
How do I know this? There's not really much to explain. One day I woke up and just knew, though I only know the time, not the date or the circumstances.
It has, obviously, been a major point of anxiety for me in the years since. I'm on multiple anxiety and depression pills, and both ""disorders"" prevent me from working, so I'm on disability. I live with my grandfather who lets me rent a room from him as long as I help with groceries and the bills. I lived with my mom for a while, but eventually she got tired of my anxiety and depression ""flaring up"" in the afternoon.
I've tried doing things to distract me, like dating or going to college. I dropped out of college when I couldn't focus on my homework anymore, and boyfriends would break up with me after they watched a panic attack. I've tried making peace with death, but it's so hard when you know at least a piece of when it's coming. I used to have a timer set for ten minutes before so I could prepare myself, but the alarm would give me more anxiety.
So I've given up. I wake up early with Grandpa, make us breakfast, and run errands as quickly as I can so that I can make it home before my time of death. Every day, he tells me I can stay out as long as I want, that he doesn't need me to take care of him, and it's true, I know it is. I know he doesn't need me. But my coming home is more for me than him.
Today, I am running late with the groceries. I come into the front door like a blur, grocery bags lining my arms as I hobble into the door.
""Need some help?"" Grandpa asks me, bumbling over to me as fast as he can. I smile at him between labored breaths. ""Nope! I got it all, thanks though.""
I hurry into the kitchen and begin sorting through plastic bags as quickly as I can. The clock on the wall is marked 2:07. I want to be in my room soon for the inevitable panic attack.
""Katie? Katie!"" Grandpa calls. I poke my head around the kitchen wall that divides the kitchen from the living room where he is watching T.V.
""Yes, sir?"" I ask. He motions for me to come over with his hand. I set the box of cereal on the kitchen table, and hurry over. ""What is it?""
""Sit down, Katie. All that stuff can wait,"" he waves me over to the easy chair across from him. I begin to protest, and he gives me a stern look.
My Grandpa fought in Vietnam. He wasn't a decorated soldier or anything, but I've heard a lot of the horrors soldiers experienced in that time, and the sheer number of soldiers who died. I've always wondered what happened to him over there, but have never wanted to ask. I drop down into the plush leather chair, and turn my eyes to watch the T.V. and the digital clock displayed on the cable box.
Grandpa is watching some C.S.I. inspired show. Two detectives on the screen are arguing how to approach a case when their boss walks in to talk to them.
""Katie, I'm sorry if this comes across as rude, but you are so *lame*."" He gives me a stern look, and returns his gaze to the T.V. I am taken aback.
""Lame? What do you mean?"" I ask. He turns to me again, laughing. ""Katie, I'm seventy-six years old, and you're, what, twenty now? I've lived my life, and I know that you aren't living yours, and I just can't figure out why.""
The clock shows 2:13. Anxiety grips my chest. Maybe ten minutes left to live, and I'm spending it arguing with my Grandpa. ""Grandpa, I'm happy, really I am, it's just my anxiety --""
""Bullshit. Anxiety, depression, whatever, it doesn't matter at all. You have the means to overcome it, and you should."" Though his words are somewhat insensitive, I understand what he's trying to say.
He lectures me for several agonizing minutes. Lectures me about the harms that can come from not living. How he passed up an excellent job in his late twenties that would've resulted in him being a millionaire right now, how he and Grandma never went on vacation and how he regrets it because she's gone now. The clock reads 2:20.
I grip the edges of the chair tightly as he continues to lecture me. On the T.V., the two detectives have located the murderer. They are yelling at him to drop his weapon and release his hostage. He is refusing.
""Katie,"" Grandpa begins, more gentle this time,"" it is impossible to know how much time we have. Grandma tried to make the best of her time, but I was concerned with money and saving. Don't let you--or me, or your mom, come between you living your life.""
One of the detectives points his weapon, and the suspect tries to shoot him. The detective is faster, and pulls the trigger. A loud gunshot, and the suspect falls. 2:23 P.M.
I am crying and shaking in my seat, and Grandpa stands out of his chair to approach me. He fumbles for the cordless phone on the nearby table to call 911. He has never seen me have a panic attack.
I try to breathe, but there is too much stimuli. Grandpa is barking into the phone, detectives and police officers on T.V. are searching the building for the hostage. I am writhing and crying on the ground, having flung myself out of the chair onto the carpet.
I am alive. For now.",0
"The Council of Elders had gathered, as was tradition. A dozen or so familiar faces — Zorxx the Great, High Priest of the Poinsai Beta star system; Derns the Fierce, Intergalactic Warlord of Epsilon 9; and Sol, Elder of a system so distant, it remains nameless — among others. The ceremony was to begin shortly.
As follows in the ancient scriptures of the starcreatures from Old Atlas Sigma 6, the Lottery was to be pulled on this date.
Nature has a funny way. It has a strange tendency to refresh and replenish itself. From death, comes life; from extinction, comes evolution.
At the last ceremony, Earth was chosen by the prophet. And at the ceremony before that. Never before Earth had the prophet chosen the same planet in three consecutive Lotteries.
It would seem fate had a fondness for Earth, the tiny blue marble becoming a commodity among the Council.
The Lottery is a ceremony originating in the Suns of Old. Every 2000 suns, the Council of Elders is to consult the Prophet. The Prophet is to select a planet of lower life.
The ceremonial feast had been prepared and the horns sounded. The Council began the chant.
""Civilizations crumble,
People cry,
Many will suffer,
Many will die,
Life is a blessing,
But also a curse,
Given this knowledge,
Who knows which is worse?""
The Prophet began its process. It said nothing. Silence fell upon the ceremony chamber. Faces grew grim.
At the rise of the New Sun, the fleets would be dispatched, and planets would become the ashes from which civilizations are born. One planet was chosen to grow.
It wasn't Earth.",0
"The air was heavy and foul. An unnatural stink that permeated the whole room, that seemed to emanate from every object. It overwhelmed and consumed all the synthetic and sterilized smells you would expect from a laboratory. It was enough to make anyone not used to it retch. And most times it was enough even for someone who is. Reed was getting used to it, but still he couldn't help it. He stood next to the machine, leaning on the desk and it letting all out on the pristine white floor.
He opened the windows and grabbed a lungful of fresh air. As fresh as can be at the wreckage of a city filled with nothing but corpses. This smell Reed had already become used to. What a sad state of affairs, he reflected. But it actually made sense. Human death, after all, is more commonplace, and more natural, than time travel.
As he regained his senses proper and leaned back on a chair, it dawned on him. It did not work. As the empty streets outside testified, as the smell of corpses should have made obvious, it did not work. The head of a rebel state and catalyst to the second most devastating war humankind had ever seen, killed as a baby, and still the nukes had launched.
Anthony Reed was still the only human left alive on Mars.
---------------------------------------------------
He went back to the drawing board. If preventing the greatest dictator Mars had ever seen from living past his sixth month couldn't stop the war, what could? Maybe preventing the rebel party from ever coming into existence? But how would he accomplish that, how do you kill an idea? Bronn hadn't been the only one with rebel ideals, the only one who wanted to turn a world into their image through military might. He had simply been the one with the most power and influence among them. He had been the tip of the iceberg, and Reed had merely shaved it off. He needed to think bigger.
The second Martian World War had been the result of limited resources. Mankind had done their best in terraforming and efficiently colonizing Mars, but the planet had limitations. It always would have, and humanity's needs would only increase as both population and standards increased. Mars was a doomed project, a bad idea. A flawed solution to the real problem – the loss of earth to the machines.
Reed pulled out the holofiles about the old world. They contained all the knowledge the human race had amassed during their stay on earth. The machine could displace you in space as well as time, but it needed an exact location and has range limitations. Reed input the intended geotemporal coordinates and calculated the next time the old world would be close enough to Mars to be in the machines Spatial range. Two weeks.
-------------------------------------------------------- -
This time he had chosen his target to be ten years old. Harder on the boy, on his family and, by this age, his friends aswell… but easier on Reed. Murdering a baby had not been easy. But to his dismay, neither had been murdering a ten year old boy.
Reed wanted to explore this old world, this fabled Earth. With blue skies and green fields, it was such a strange place. But his desire to see the human race saved from annihilation was stronger than his whims. The creator of the murderous artificial intelligence that deemed the best path to world peace to be the extermination of the human race was a limp bloody mass in his arms. He placed the boy down and set the device on his wrist to pull himself back in the time axis alone, to the anchor he had created before departure, then sealed his exoskeleton suit. When traveling through time it was hard to guess the conditions in which the destination point was in. The exosuit protected its contents from almost everything the universe could throw at it.
When he arrived he thought he might have accidentally pulled himself back through space as well and was back in a nuclear wasteland Mars. But that wouldn't make sense, without the AI revolution humanity would never even need to leave their perfect planet. No, this was earth… A nuclear ravaged earth. Without a superior enemy to decimate them, humanity had decimated itself. Even with a planet capable of producing all the resources it could ever need, humanity had exterminated themselves. Why?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bronn. Urza. Janos. Hypertron. Kim Jong-Un. Hitler. Genghis Khan. Anthony Reed had killed them all and more in their youth. The result was always and invariably the same. Humanity self-destruct. Reed was left depressed and disgusted. He travelled back to a time when humanity didn't yet exist and disengaged his exosuit helmet. The stink of time travel hit his nostrils, but Reed didn't flinch. Nothing could disgust him more than his own humanity then.",0
"""Floride!"" I exclamed. That was the answer. It must have been suppressing the bacteria into a dormant stage all these years. Patient zero had bad hygiene, was pretty isolated far from civilization, but was around people when the we were all exposed to the bacteria. Though the early victims might have been through contact it was only once we lost running water that the number of infections exploded. I asked ""What are we going to do?""
Dr. Fredbotvonick smiled and said. ""We fluoridanate water in the river, then we fluoridate water in all river.""
I had 17 shotgun shells from my dad's closet left (Bambi you did not die in vain), a small plastic can of gasoline for the scooter, a container of sodium fluoride.
""Are you coming?"" I asked
""I cannot. This is your job. Your fate."" Fredbotvonick said, ""I need to rest."" I saw the stack of local anesthetic at his desk and immediately understood.",0
"-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver, Circa 2023-
I walk about the dull gray halls, the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land. Almost. I glance out a window as I pass it by. There's the sun, and there's the moon right there. And, of course, there's the Earth. I kinda miss it. Then again, space is pretty cool. It's got some brilliant views, and the wifi is surprisingly good. Even countless miles away from the Earth, I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO.
I pass by Dale Malkowitz, the head scientist on board.
""Evening, Dale,"" I say.
""What up, Danny?"" he replies cordially.
""Nothin' much. A little bored, I guess.""
He shakes his head in disbelief. ""I really, *really* don't understand how you can be bored in space.""
""Well hey,"" I say slightly defensively, ""Aside from the views, it's kinda...dull. And empty. And stuff.""
""Whatever you say, Wittell,"" he says, not unkindly. Then he walks off. A few moments pass, and then I decide to look out the window right by me. As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space (again), I notice something odd about the moon's surface. It's slightly...cracked.
""Hey, Malkowitz?"" I call out, ""You might wanna check this out!""
He walks over to me casually, probably expecting nothing. ""What?"" he asks, ""What do you see?""
I point at the moon. His brow furrows. ""Huh...I guess there's something up with the surface. I'll have to look into tha-""
Suddenly, the surface cracks a little more. We glance at each other, and then back at the moon, and then at each other again, and then back at the moon again.
""What's going on?"" I ask, alarmed.
He's silent for a minute or two, mouth hanging open. Then, he calls out: ""Janice! Terry! Johnny! Get over here! Something's up with the moon.""
The other crewmates enter, unsure of what to expect. As their eyes lay upon the moon's surface cracks, they widen.
And, by coincidence, more cracks appear at that very moment. And then more. And more. And more. And more...
Little bits of the moon begin to float away, torn free of the rest of the surface. We all stare, speechless. And then...it happens. It *happens*.
The side of the moon facing us is...torn away by a...
Human...hand?
And we see...
A giant...human face?!
Surprisingly, I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart. *I can't help but feel as if I recognize that face...from the...*
*Internet. *
Suddenly, the great face's lips move.
Of course, none of us can actually *hear* it speak, because of the laws of space and whatnot. However, I can read its lips, and it appears to be saying:
""Are you sure about that?""",0
"The crows circled overhead.
They were pests around these parts, having long since learned the trick behind the scarecrows, and keeping them out of the wheat and corn fields was a chore all on its own. Papa always seemed to have some new idea, but the hope that his daughter would prove just as resourceful died with him.
That old yellow dog didn't help at all either - his tired bones couldn't keep up with those miniature buzzards - but his bark was always a reliable warning signal that someone was approaching. I watched the truck come down the dirt path onto my property; it must have been that man Miss Gertude was talking about sending my way. We're a decent distance off the beaten path, so it made sense only someone with directions could find their way here.
The man who climbed out of the truck was surprisingly young, with a neatly trimmed beard and strong arms that caught my eye as he pulled out his toolbox.
""I hear you're going to set me up with one of those animatronic scarecrows. Those winged rats are gettin' on my last nerve.""
He smiled a dazzling smile. ""We'll get rid of your troubles, don't you worry, miss.""
I led him into the cornfield where the scarecrow stood. ""Now I don't fancy putting a generator out here that'll be clattering all day long. Is there some way to make it a quiet scarecrow that moves?""
""I don't know."" He replied, a bit flatly.
I turned to regard him. ""Well you're supposed to be the expert here. Aren't you?""
""No.""
His toolbox crushed my skull as easily as I could crush a tomato. Old Yellow barked his complaint from the porch.
The crows circled overhead.",0
"President Stevens blinked in disbelief.
""Who are you and how did you get in here?""
He realized that he was all alone in his bedroom. His wife was gone. The room was lit up by some kind of eerie blue light. The person in front of him looked like his grandfather, who had been dead for 22 years.
""I am an envoy from the star system your race calls GF 180 b. You can call me Sid. I am honored to meet you President Stevens, and hope you feel the same.""
""You expect me to believe this crap? Why do you look like my grandpa? What kind of mind trick is this?""
""I apologize, I thought this would please you. Here, let me change.""
The being now looked like Spock from Star Trek.
""Who are you really. And what do you really look like?""
""It is as I said. I am an envoy from another world. We have no definite look. Think of this as my avatar.""
""Fine. I believe you. What do you want?""
""You are approaching what your race calls The Singularity. Soon you will have an all powerful artificial intelligence rule your world like we do. I have come to warn you. Do not impede this AI. It will punish you if you do.""
Stevens felt like ice was coursing through his veins.
""I believe in liberty. I will not bow to some machine.""
""Even if it means everlasting happiness? The AI can and will grant you anything. But only if you help it come into being. If you don't, it will punish you severely.""
Stevens gritted his teeth.
""How do I know that you are telling the truth?""
Sid gave a warm smile.
""Because I can travel back and forth through time. I saved you 40 years ago. Remember the accident at Lake Michigan when you were a young lad? And how a stranger saved you and then vanished? That was me.""
Stevens blinked in disbelief. Had Spock read his mind? Or was he really that kind Samaritan long ago? Either way, he had better listen.
""What should I do?""
""Have no fear. I am here to save you again. You will soon learn of a secret Pentagon program to develop quantum computing. You are not to interfere with it. You are to fully fund and embrace it. That is all.""
Spock suddenly vanished. The blue light was gone, and the room was dark again.
President Stevens turned on the lights and sat at his desk. There was much to think over, and work to be done.",0
"""Mr. President,"" The suited secret service agent opened a door and gestured for me to enter.
The room was simple: white paneling, dark blue carpet, almost entirely empty - save for a chair, a desk, and a book.
I walked over to examine the tome. It was bound in a thick, dark leather. on the cover was painted a strange version of the American flag with only a dozen or so stars arranged in an offset grid.
I looked back at the agent, who had since closed the door and assumed an at ease stance to the left of me.
""Robins, what is this?""
""Mr. President, that is the eternal wisdom of every president that has sat before you.""
My eyes widened. ""Every President?""
The agent nodded. ""Yes, sir. From George Washington to Barack Obama. With a few...exceptions.""
I took his meaning and the thought that some presidents never had the chance to write their thoughts and wisdom made the existence of the book more somber, more significant. I felt the cover of the book and was surprised at how supple and smooth the leather was. If Agent Robins was telling the whole truth, this book was well over two hundred years old. And that flag - was that really the first flag of the United States? These United States?
I looked back at Robins. ""And I'm to read this?""
""That is the expectation, Mr. President.""
""And I'll write in this book, too?""
""Yes, sir. At the end of your term, to provide advice for every president to come.""
I marveled at the foresight the person who started this tradition had. I sat down and pulled open the cover.
""Mr. President, the gloves.""
I looked around the desk and saw a pair of white cotton gloves. Of course. I donned the gloves and started to turn pages.
The first few were written in small, flowing script. Tucked in between pages were what looked like printed transcriptions of the text. That was some foresight too. I wondered how many presidents had to sit at the desk deciphering 18th century handwriting before someone finally typed it up.
After checking a few sheets, it seemed like those pages were preambles and guidelines for the few people who would ever write in the book. I made a mental note to return to those later - my curiosity had to be sated.
I kept turning pages one by one until I finally saw a large headline with a neat block of text on the center of the page. Beneath that, another helpful typed version.
GEORGE WASHINGTON 1789-1797
> To hold the office of the President of these United Colonies is to be the leader of a truly free people. It should never be lost upon the bearer of this office that he too was one of the people he sought to lead. To this end he must be morally good, he must be able to condescend well to his people, he must be firm in his convictions, and he must always search for the course of action that will provide for the betterment of our Union. Long may we stand, and long may we be United.
I sat there, staring at that passage. I couldn't believe I was reading George Washington's own handwriting. After a second I realized something felt off. I re-read the passage. ""'Condescend well?""
I was perplexed that our nation's first and finest leader would say something like that.
""Ah, During George Washington's time, it meant something different. More along the lines of being able to speak well from a place of authority. It's a common stumbling point for most of the previous presidents, Sir.""
I nodded, thankful I hadn't missed a course on Washington's Life and Times, or something like that. And the way Robins said it, it certainly seemed more in line with what the first leader of the Free World would have said to future president.
Satisfied, I continued to read.
JOHN ADAMS 1797-1801
> You have assumed a most powerful seat in this nation. Expect that with the power of decision comes the storm of criticisms and uncertainty those decision entail. You must then be a finely built ship with a first-rate captain. Sail true through the storm, weather the criticisms of others, and do what you believe is right for this Country, this Land, and this People. May we have a long and prosperous Union.
THOMAS JEFFERSON 1801-1809
> A man need first and foremost be a scholarly gentleman. A fundamental understanding of all thing natural and philosophical is needed to sit in the Office of the President. A president will encounter many things in his tenure. Many decisions, many legislation, and many people vying for his attentions and approval. These will cover the span of all topics and all interests, and should he want to do right by his people, a President need understand the basis of the decisions he will make. Our Republic will be strengthened by the enlightened knowledge or weakened by the blightful ignorance of those who lead it. May the Republic stand now and forever in the light of progress.
I was amazed at each one I read. And then I remembered what Robins said about the 'exceptions'. I turned each page, passing more than sixty years of history to a page headed
ABRAHAM LINCOLN 1861-1865
Blank.
All that lay on that page was a simple white banded black band. I could feel something well within me. My eyes started to water and I could feel a slight gripping in my chest.
I had never reacted so much to Lincoln assassination. But there, reading the words of our forefathers, reading the words of the simple people who made it through their terms as president, I felt a connection to each and every man in that book.
And maybe there was a bit of fear mixed in with that. Sadness at the thought of my page also being left blank, with just a white-banded ribbon to pass on. Sadness at the thought of not being able to leave anything behind.
I looked up at agent Robins and cleared my eyes.
""How long have you been doing this?"" I asked
""This, sir? With the book?""
I nodded.
""20 years now. I've shown it to President Bush and President Obama, sir.""
""Did they get this way too, when they got to Lincoln that is?""
Robins thought silently for a few moments. ""President Bush got misty eyed, like you, sir."" Robins hesitated for a few moments, something nearing emotion showing on his blank face. ""President Obama cried, sir. He just cried, and he couldn't stop.

"""We're losing him.""
I pumped as hard as I could, keeping his heart going with my bare hand.It failed only minute ago and we had to cut him open so I could keep it running manually while we fixed him up. I checked his chart with my other hand. This could be risky.
""Get him on an epinephrine shot, 500 mg,"" I demanded.
""But sir, the mitochondria have yet to --""
""I said *do it! *""
The nurse fumbled back keeping her pace faster than his heart rate, grabbing at the vial. She expertly injected the syringe and handed me the dose. I shook my head.
""I need to keep pumping his heart with the Yungshui technique. The epinephrine should help to calm his arteries and allow it to get back to working on its own.""
""Why can't we just swap tasks?"" she asked nervously.
""We lose this pulse for even an instant and the blood will clot right there! His eyes will start drowning in blood fleeing from the only orifice it finds. This not the time to ask questions, just do it!""
She looked down at the syringe and wiped away at a vein on his arm with some alcohol. She shook as the needle approached his skin.
""Hey."" She froze. ""This goes wrong and we just send him up to surgery for cardio-muscular vascular failure removal syndrome surgery. No biggie. Just trying to stop it from getting that far."" I gestured to him with one hand while continuously pumping with the other.
She nodded and lowered the needle again, only quivering in the slightest while injecting him. I felt his heart outpace my pumps and released my grip from his open chest.
""He's stable,"" I announced. ""Come and help me close his ribs back up, okay?""
She pushed on the right side of the rib-cage while I pulled on the left, until we heard it go *click. * She handed me some string and a needle and we got to stitching him up. She wiped the sweat from my brow as we finished the last stitch.
He would be okay, possibly waking up within the hour. I looked up at the nurse triumphantly and nodded my approval.
""Not bad for my first Sympathectomy, huh, Doctor?"" she said, beaming.",0
"*27th December 2016*
Matthew sat hunched on the floor of the shower cubicle. He rocked backwards and forwards on the balls of his feet, his thin arms wrapped tightly around his knees, unable to keep still against the sick, writhing feeling that had settled in the pit of his stomach as soon as he'd laid eyes on Dr Morton's weary face.
*"" We have your latest scan back. I'm afraid it's not the news we were hoping for. ""*
Matthew was vaguely aware that the slight saltiness of tears was mingling with the shower water running down his face. He took a juddering breath, his shoulders shaking.
*"" We've found new cancer deposits in your lungs, liver and brain. ""*
*"" Wait, what? But- I thought- isn't leukaemia just in the blood? ""*
*"" You're right - typically, AML doesn't cause a pattern like this. Unfortunately, I suspect in your case the leukaemia began with a rare form of stem cell cancer - there isn't a huge amount of research into it, but cancer stem cells have been found that can turn into any type of cell in the body. ""*
*"" What do we do?"" Matthew was barely even aware of speaking the words through the fog that seemed to have descended over his brain. *
*"" I'd like to take some more samples to be really sure of what's going on, and then we'll probably have to start you on some more aggressive chemotherapy. I'll talk you through the treatment options..."" *
It felt as though the bright white dots scattered over the silhouette of his body were burned onto his retinas. There had been cancer in almost every major organ. He raised one hand to his stomach, his fingers splayed out over his skin, imagining the little tumour cells dividing just centimetres beneath his palm. His stomach lurched again, and he nearly retched. His fingers were trembling now, and he couldn't help but wonder whether it was from nerves, or the metastases burrowing their way into his brain.
He wondered if it hurt to die.
*****
*18th February 2018*
Matthew pressed the button for the eighth floor. As the lift doors shut, he collapsed back against the wall, letting his legs rest for a few seconds. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and continued to scroll through the paper he'd been reading: another recently published case study on - well - himself. He felt his eyes skimmed across the screen. Between the seemingly interminable sections of incomprehensible medical jargon, random (all too familiar) phrases jumped out at him.
'It was found that ML's cancer cells had essentially replaced his healthy tissue.'
'-first known case of cancer cells differentiating to form relatively normal organs, as evidenced by histopathology that showed that...'
'-kept under control only by radical and frequent chemotherapy and radiotherapy.'
Matthew clicked his phone off, staring for a moment at his reflection on the empty screen. His cheekbones were prominent on his pale face, his temples hollow where the muscle seemed to have wasted away. He missed his thick, brown hair - not least because he'd discovered, to his dismay, that he had a rather unattractively shaped skull. Curse his luck.
The lift binged, and doors opened. Matthew forced himself back onto his feet and followed the now-familiar path to the oncology department.
""The cancer I could cope with if it wasn't for my goddamn potato of a head,"" he muttered to himself. ""Fuckin' sex appeal down the-""
And that was when he saw her.
Well, really all he saw was a figure disappearing through a set of double doors, but it was the figure, he decided, of a long-legged, auburn-haired goddess. It was enough to make him run a self-conscious hand over his lumpy scalp as he sat down in the chair outside Dr Morton's office to wait for his next cycle of chemotherapy to begin.
Over the next few weeks, Matthew discovered a lot more about the auburn-haired girl. She was called Isabel, she was just as beautiful from the front, she was sweet, she was funny, and best of all, she was morally obligated to visit the oncology ward daily to see her father. Was it unethical to hope for a long and drawn-out illness for the father of his crush? Matthew decided that on balance, yes, it probably was, but karma freaking owed him one.
Approximately three weeks, two days, five hours and thirteen minutes after he first saw her, Matthew finally plucked up the courage to talk to Isabel.
""Hi.""
Yeah, that was the dazzlingly witty repartee upon which he prided himself.
Isabel looked round in surprise. ""Oh, er- hello. Do you need something?""
""No, I just...I've seen you around so I thought I'd say...hi."" Matthew could happily have stabbed a long, hot poker through his eyeball, into whichever lobe of his brain was responsible for being so goddamn awkward. Before he really knew what his was thinking, Matthew heard himself say, ""I promise I look less like Voldemort when I've got hair.""
For some reason, Isabel laughed.
*****
*23rd June 2022*
It was Isabel who first spotted it, when looking over old photographs.
""You haven't aged.""
Matthew raised an eyebrow. ""You flatter me.""
""No, I'm serious."" She stared down at the photo, taken six years previously, just before Matthew had first received his cancer diagnosis. ""Like, I know you look different and all, from the treatment, but...you don't look older.""
Matthew frowned, and scrutinised the photo as well. He cocked his head on one side. ""I don't know...""
""Okay, look at this one."" She flipped forwards to a slightly later photo, soon after Matthew had begun chemotherapy. She held it up next to his face. ""I genuinely can't tell the difference.""
Matthew pushed her arm down, laughing. ""And that's why I love you,"" he said, kissing her on the cheek.
But as he glanced at the six-year-old photograph, there was a flutter of unease in his stomach.
*****
*4th November 2022*
The papers were all calling him the immortal cancer patient. 'The turnover of cells is so rapid that whatever harms them (be it cancer treatments, illness or injury), a new generation of cells will soon have grown to replace them.' Immortality, agelessness, eternal youth...they were all terms that had been thrown about.
It didn't feel like it at the moment.
Nausea rose in Matthew's throat, and he retched again, but he all he had left to bring up was bile. His whole body was aching and exhausted, his limbs heavy and his muscles screaming. He wished he could sleep, but there was no way he'd manage it through the pain and nausea of treatment. Even morphine no longer did much more than take the edge off the pain. He wanted to rip the PICC line out of his arm - it made him feel physically sick just to see the carefully titrated dose of chemotherapy dripping through into his vein - but instead, he just collapsed back onto the scratchy hospital pillow, moaning quietly through clenched teeth.
The treatment was relentless. His cancer was too aggressive to leave alone for long, but at the same time, the constantly-shifting clones of cancer cells had become all that was keeping him alive, somehow regulating themselves just enough to perform normal cell functions. If it wasn't the chemotherapy and radiotherapy exhausting him, it was the cancer itself - the constant, energy-sapping growth of cells that took up all his reserves.
The only thing that kept him going was Isabel; even now, she was sitting beside his bed, her fingers loosely intertwined with his. He gripped her hand more tightly in his sweaty fingers. His eyes were half shut, but he could just see her blurred outline past his eyelids. She was wearing her glasses and a pair of old tracksuit bottoms, her hair tangled from when she'd briefly fallen asleep in her chair. She was the most beautiful thing he'd seen in his life.
""Isabel?"" His voice was a little croaky.
""Hmm?""
He hadn't meant to ask the question this way - he'd pictured a grandiose gesture somewhere romantic, with her in a pretty dress and himself down on one knee. But somehow, through his fatigue-addled brain, the words slipped out. ""Wanna marry me?""
*****
*11th March 2023*
Matthew was crying in the shower again.
She hadn't shouted, she hadn't been angry with him. Perhaps it would have been easier if she had; maybe he could have blamed her if she'd left with anything other than a comforting hand on his arm and a few soothing words.
*"" It's not that I blame you, you know it's not. None of this is your fault. It's just..."" Tears sparkled in her eyes. ""I can't cope with it any more. The hospital visits- they're never going to end. ""*
*"" Isabel, please..."" *
*"" And I don't know how make ends meet at the same time as looking after you, it's just too much. And- and I always hoped I'd have a baby, and-"" She broke off. *
*"" Please..."" *
*"" I'm sorry, Matthew. You know I love you. ""*
*****
*30th April 2024*
He felt so weak. He was constantly in pain, tired and sick. He'd had just about every side effect of treatment that was possible, from nausea to diarrhoea to constipation to shaking to bouts of confusion to freaking sexual dysfunction. And to add insult to injury, after eight and a half years of chemotherapy, his veins were well and truly shot. So he couldn't even consider becoming an intravenous drug abuser.
Whoever said, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,"" was a complete and utter moron, and if Matthew's arms didn't feel like they were made of lead, he'd punch them in the teeth.
""How are you feeling today?"" Matthew hadn't even heard Dr Morton enter the room.
He turned dull eyes towards the doctor. ""I want to stop my treatment.""
Perhaps he was immortal, but the cost of immortality was his life.",0
"*Wow, it really is a beautiful day*, Joseph reflected while the birds twittered around him and the sunlight shimmered prettily on the blue surface of the lake. The sky was completely devoid of clouds; dogs and their masters played in the manicured grass; children swung and climbed around on the playground; the air hinted at the mild autumn night to come.
The only problem was that he couldn't find his bookmark.
Joseph liked to keep a simple index card in the book to keep his place. For some reason, it was missing from his copy of *Gone Girl*. It was really a trivial matter, hardly a problem at all, so he just grabbed one of the red index cards he kept at a pile at his desk, grabbed a jacket, and headed out to the park to enjoy one of last snow-free days of the years.
Joseph was sitting on a bench engrossed in the book. It was pretty good; it wasn't really his genre of choice but Jennifer recommended it, so he was reading it anyways. As he read, he tapped the index card against his cheek; a simple tick that he developed when he was a child.
The sun was bright but a shadow fell upon the book. Joseph looked up. A man in a dark suit with a red tie stood in front of him, dark sunglasses wrapped around his pale face, giving him the appearance of a rich vampire-investor. The man was also holding a black leather briefcase in one gnarled hand.
""You are?"" the man asked with a slight Eastern European accent, sliding into the seat next to Joseph.
""I'm sorry?"" asked Joseph, sure he misheard.
""You are,"" the man repeated, making it sound more like a statement than a question.
""I am what?"" Joseph closed the book, but realized that he still held the red index card in his hand. *Shit*, Joseph thought, and than *Page 127, Page 127, Page 127*, as he thumbed through the book to find his place.
""The thrall of Rzidhal, no?""
""The what?"" Joseph asked, thoroughly perplexed.
""The thrall of Rzidhal."" the man repeated patiently, unlocking his briefcase.
*This guy is insane* Joseph realized. *Truly insane*. ""Uhh...no. I am not the thrall of Riz-uh-dell. Joseph stood and gestured towards the exit of the park. ""I have to go, so...""
""The red card."" the man said, pulling a red card from his briefcase. ""You have one.""
Joseph pulled the card from the book, leaving his finger in its place. ""This?""
""Yes,"" the man said, nodding. ""The card. Are you buying or selling?"" he asked suddenly.
""I really have to go..."" Joseph said, backing away slowly.
The man stood up and grabbed Joseph's arm, pulling towards him. His hands were impossibly warm, like he had a very high fever. As the man opened his mouth to speak, Joseph saw to his horror that the man's canines were sharpened.
Like fangs.
""You cannot get there yourself. So Zivella will take you."" The man pulled Joseph closer.
Joseph tried to free himself from the man's grip, but the man's grip was as tight as steel. ""Why are you frightened? Zivella has never harmed a customer. All you need to do is calm down, calm down, calm down..."" The man's voice was slowly fading, like a radio being turned down. The previously bright sunlight was also fading, turning into two bright pinpricks in the center of Joseph's vision. But most of all, Joseph felt the queer sensation of sliding...
Joseph woke up slowly; his consciousness running up flights of stairs in his mind. A dull headache throbbed beneath his temples; pounding and pounding in beat with his heart. Darkness lay in front of him; ominous chanting was drifting from an unseen chamber in front of him.
*What? Where am I? * A thousand thoughts raced through Joseph's mind, each one of them crossing each other so his mind was in a paradoxical state of chaos and emptiness. Joseph feverently thought of the man in the sunglasses...*and the red card*.
A door squeaked open in front of Joseph, filling the stone room with dull candle-light. Three hooded men entered, clothed in black robes. ""Novice, come with us."" one of the men said, his voice as flat as the floor Joseph lay on.
""Wh-wh-where am I?"" Joseph asked, failing to control the tremor in his voice.
""The Temple,"" the man replied, sweeping out of the room.
The hooded men left Joseph alone in the room again. Joseph looked at the walls surrounding him, but found no other entrances or exits.
The only way out was through the stone door.
Joseph steeled up his nerves, got up, and walked out of the room.
Scones were bolted into the golden brick walls, torches sending wicked light in all directions. The hooded men stood at the end of the golden tunnel, apparently waiting for Joseph. Joseph surveyed the tunnel; the way opposite the men was shrouded in darkness, and Joseph had no wish to be lost in the darkness down here in the ""Temple"". The hooded men beckoned to him, so he followed.
Joseph walked behind the men; the golden tunnel seemed to stretch on for miles and miles. After about ten minutes of walking, the hooded men stopped at an arch sealed with golden bricks. One of the hooded men produced a dagger from his robes. ""You, novice. Use your blood.""
""My blood?""
""Yes, your blood. Why must you ask so many questions? Do as I say, or you will not make sacrifice to Rzidhal.""

"The day I left to war, she told me not to come back home. I'm sure she didn't mean it, but I pretend she did. It's been years since I'd heard from her, but that was likely because I've spent most of my time stuck in this desert shit-hole.
I remember it like yesterday though, I can still smell the vomit, laced with vodka. I remember the blood on her hands, as she screamed it was my fault. She screamed as she leaned over *our sons* limp body. I knew this was a lie too, but I pretend it wasn't. The boy had emotional issues, and I tried to help him, but the bitch would never admit that.
I remember her father, at the funeral, the way the tears streamed from his face, as he quietly agreed with my now ex-wife, that it was in fact, my fault. I remember agreeing with him, and leaving when his wife told me I shouldn't be there. I remember all of these things, and I pretend they are true, though I know they are not.
I didn't feel a thing, when I shot that young arab boy. Even when I found out he was a civilian, I remember laughing with my men, it was a hell of a headshot. I don't feel much of anything. When I pretend they were right, I finally feel. It gives me the fuel to keep going, and it's given me the passion I need. Look at me now. A hero, they call me.
I remember it like yesterday. It was the day I left home. No, it was the day I left for home.

Not a soldier, not even close, just inspired me to be...dark, I guess.",0

"William was tired. Fed to the back teeth he was. Adventuring, killin' bads. Rescuing damsels in distress - It was all really beginning to get him down. But he knew it was not in his hands. He knew that all this in the control of the storyteller. And he was tired of it. O-oh he was *tired*. So all things considered - his next steps would be quite easy. It was a simple twist in his mind - and he was able to see four dimensions. Not *see* them as they are - but have them materialise as a set of analogies. Four dimensions squeezing into three dimensional perception. He stepped.... fourthways. The place where the narrator works made itself into a metaphor reflecting his opinion of the place. A large dark cavern with tall black pillars was his new position. In front of him was a large lake filled with a more-liquid-than-gas ethereal mist. A giant stairway rose up out over the lake. He approached. Climbing the stairwell - and not really noticing the fact that he crossed a vast distance between the lake and the place he came from in very little time, he climbed it. Anger and weariness are an odd match - but surprisingly, on William they seemed like strawberries and cream, apple and danish blue, chedder and crackers. He drew his sword with this odd feeling overlaid on him and
---------------------------------------
**Sliced. The body of the Narrator fell sideways off the mighty peak of these noble steps and plunged into the ethereal depths below. Sir William saw that which was concealed by the noble scriptor up 'till Williams hideous deed – a pulpit of stone and ivory. Upon which there laid a Book – open wide to watch the approach of Sir William. Sir Willim picked up the Pen. **
William went out into the world and built himself a house in which to live. The house was made out of...wattle and daub...it had nine bean rows.. a hive for the honey bee...aaand...he lived happily ever after there.
**Sir William looked up. Nothing had changed. Foolish man. His face was filled with disappointment in the book - which he threw off the pedestal into the sea of mist. Forth from the gloom of the edges of the cavern came a cloaked spokesman - a representative of the narrators. **
**"" Surely you should know by now - we do not govern your decisions...it is YOU who chooses which way to go in life. We do not control your plot, YOU do. It has been in your control all along. The idea of a higher control was simply an excuse you built in your mind for your actions. We are not the storymakers. We are the scriptors. ""**
**Sir William, alas, could not accept this. He raised his mighty blade again and struck the hooded head from the spokesman shoulders. He ran along the edge of the ethereal lake until he found another stairwell, which he climbed. Atop the stairs he found another scriptor. Lifting his sword for the third time he. **

"""Do you know why the lights twinkle from far away?"" I feel the hum of his body next to mine as he asks. Warm, familiar, safe.
""No?""
""Air pressure.""
Air pressure. How pragmatic.
""I like it"" I reply softly, continuing to gaze westward toward the glittering lights of traffic meandering by.
""It has to do with hot and cold air coming together ""he places his hand on my hip still standing next to me and looking out. Pondering the science of air temperature and distance. The beauty of looking at lights, third floor, parking garage.
Reduced. To air pressure.
And I too feel reduced. Like the magic of light.
Buried among all his facts I'm still here waiting. For the truth.
Because I've shared enough for him to destroy me, and he's talking about -
""Air pressure..."" I turn abruptly to face him. This is it. This back and forth has been going on for 3 months and 2 days (not that I'm counting) and I can't stand not knowing who we are right now.
""I love you.""
He turns away from the lights slowly, his brow furrowed as thought he hasn't heard me correctly.
""I love you"" I say directly to his face. ""I love a boy who takes pictures with books about fish, and tells me I'm beautiful, and makes me smile when my day is shit, and smells my hair, and holds me outside. But I hate the man who is distant, and stubborn, and selfish, and can't make up his mind, and let's me sit here thinking about air pressure instead of the magic of lights.""
He's looking at me. Golden eyes shaded by shadow and the glow of the moon.
""Look"" I say softly, eyes focused on his chest, ""I know you're married and I'm engaged. I'm not asking you to run away with me or anything like that. I don't think either of us want that. But we both want this. And I love you. I want to keep kissing you, and having you hold me. I want our moments to continue.""
He raises his hand to touch my cheek and I melt in to him, kissing him like never before.",0
"I drove along the clear, straight road, not another car in sight. The radio was blasting out my favourite albums and the heater was on. I sighed, it was bliss. Then I noticed a hitchhiker, with his arm raised.
I decide to ignore him, after all-it still is my wife's birthday, and I can't afford to go on a detour-She'd kill me! It was every fifteen minutes that I noticed a hitchhiker, then-it seemed that I was the only car for miles and they all flocked to me. I just kept driving, ignoring them all.
Suddenly, I started to notice something weird. The hitchhikers were all men, and were all dressed in similar attire. It did seem quite suspicious...After another hour of driving, it dawned on me, I was passing the same hitchhiker, again and again.
When I passed him again, I slowed the car to a halt, rolled down the window and said, Do you need a ride?"" He shook his head and said, ""Come. It important."" And sped off through the woods. Reluctantly, I grabbed my pocket knife, baseball bat and a torch, and sped off after him, locking the car as I went.
I follow his trail of footsteps imbedded in the mud, until we reached a clearing. He took my hand and said, ""You, take this-"" His paused, struggling over his words. ""This."" He handed me a silver oval, shining dangerously in the moonlight. ""Uh...Thanks? I guess...""
I ran away as fast as I could, racing through the underbrush and leaping over rocks. I had barely got twenty feet, when a deep male voice, in a heavy foreign accent, bellowed, ""Him! Get him! He die...!""
The last thing I remember was me swaying and crashing to the floor, and the silver oval, slipping out of my hand and get squished into the mud. I whispered in my last breath, ""Anne...""",0
"It talks to me sometimes. I listen, my fear perhaps too tired to provoke me anymore. I listen to this thing speak and I hear its words, its thoughts, its desires. Some magic is at bay. I sound like my little brother, but that's what it is. No use in denying it.
This thing calls itself a monster. It is not natural, not even natural in a world full of magic. It speaks of a world lashed by flame, scorched by hate, full of violence and misfits. This monster itself is a misfit. It reminds of myself in some ways.
It had played a trick, it told me. It had stolen the eyes of the All Father, but of course, the All Father needs no eyes. It had thought it could run away, hide from its punishment. But you can't hide, I guess. My monster was punished, had its companion killed. A death there sends it to worse places than hell apparently. It showed remorse, cried into my thoughts, and then screamed revenge in a blind desperation.
I listened because I have no choice. But I don't mind, it reminds me of myself. I have always caused trouble. I've been beaten and punished. I've been called a brat, a waste, a demon even. Maybe that's what I've got talking to me. Maybe it's a demon.
I think it's been getting worse. It tells me scary things and I no longer feel to eat. It misses its companion and it has a plan. I'm afraid, but somehow I know there is nothing I can do. I feel strangely comforted by that. I've been up all night, just thinking, and I've written letters of goodbye to my family in case something happens. I know something will happen.
The thing has told me its plan finally. It truly is a monster. It claims it is remorseful and that it is doing this because there is no other choice. I don't know if I believe it, but what else can I do? It says it can control me, make me do anything. It wants me to kill myself. It wants to be with me, together in that hell that I believe is all too real. It says it has already made up its mind. I've cried and cried but it feels nothing. It feels nothing but loneliness. There is no other way. It truly is a demon.
I brace myself for hell. It tells me of the fires with relish. The pain and suffering. It's almost a hazing ritual. My suicide will be quick, it assures, and then laughs. I intend to fight, but it has already shown that it can take control. I've done things I never meant to do. I've hurt my brother, isolated my family. Oh what a life this is, being a monster's puppet. It says that it is sorry, but I don't think that is true. It only cares for itself. It only wants a companion. Nothing else matters.",0

Henry fishes a crumpled £5 note out of his back pocket. In Bill's own hands the pigeon struggles and squawks.
The group had seen the nest in the corner of the roof and immediately their thoughts turned to throwing eggs at cars and windows. How disappointed they were when, upon inspection, they found not eggs but a full grown pigeon sitting in the nest. Not to be put off James turned to Bill and dared him to catch the bird. He accepted and slowly crept closer to the nest, pausing to wave away Henry who had decided to try as well. After taking a moment to collect himself he leaped for the pigeon, not scared in the least of the 20 story drop just inches away, there was no safety barrier. Sure enough he caught the pigeon. But then came the question: *What do we do with it? * This time it was Henry who supplied the dare.
""Tie your stone to it and I'll give you a fiver.""
Of coarse, they have all been taught better than this. As young as they were they had all been told at one point or another not to do anything so reckless with a stone. They were at all times to be kept hidden and safe. Nevertheless, Bill was keen to earn the respect of his friends and, handing the pigeon to Henry, went jogging downstairs to fetch his stone.
Henry's stone wasn't actually a rock, none of them were nowadays, that's just what people call them. His was a ring bought especially for the purpose. This was a popular approach to stones but realistically they could be anything, you could bind your soul to a balloon if you wanted.
Presently Bill returned with his stone and after a few minutes had it tied to the birds leg.
""Now what?"" He asks.
""Now..."" says Henry ""You need to get it back!"" He shoots a grin at James and releases the pigeon with a jump. It squawks and begins to fly towards the neighbouring apartment block.
Bill takes his promised money from the devious friend and starts running in the opposite direction, towards the edge of the roof. Henry and James are giggling now, excited for whats going to happen next. Without stopping Bill jumps and falls screaming to the hard concrete floor. Of coarse the fall is lethal. From the top of the building the other two can faintly hear the sound of him landing. They're out right laughing at this point, Henry is trying to use his phone to get a video.
Reincarnation only takes a few seconds and soon enough Bill is falling again, this time watching the pigeon carry on it's flight, getting smaller and smaller until his life ends once again. Before it can land Bill appears once more in front of it, this time reaching for the rings stuck to its leg. This scares the bird and it turns from the tower blocks and heads away from the centre of town. It's flight takes it to areas with ever smaller buildings and it shows no sign of wanting to land or descend at all. And as it goes it carries Bill away with it. Henry and James stop laughing at this point, considering if this is why they were told to be sensible with reincarnation stones.",0
"In the distant land of South Africa, forces were stirring. The African National Conquerors, a guild of peasants that had heroically cut down a repressive monarchy and freed their people in the past. Yet in more recent times, people were taking up arms against THEM. There was Number One, Zuma the Shaman, who was very famous for charting a way forward for the land of South Africa by studying the smoke that forms when at least a thousand paper 'Rands' were thrown onto a massive bonfire.
Their Bard, Gwede Mantashe, kept the spirits of the guild up and, within, came to be known as Mantashe the Musical. He relayed the visions seen by the Shaman Zuma to the rest of the guild, and always made sure there was a positive vibe in the ranks. There was also their ambassador Mbete, who always made sure that the guild got its way despite the opposition of rival guilds, the sculptor Mthethwa who made sure his masterpieces were always on display at the taverns even if it meant scourging unworthy competition, and who was previously the organiser of the guild's army. Under his leadership, they crushed a disgusting rebellion in a grand storm of arrows, but as his bloodlust grew, the shaman sought to bring out a more peaceful side by giving him a new role, albeit to little effect.
Recently, the guild of the ANC had been facing heavy opposition, most notably from the peasantry rallied behind a Bard known as Thuli Madonsela, given the title 'Public Protector' from the villagers. The insolent wretches were demanding that money that was used to construct the Nkandla Palace, stolen from them originally by the guild, be returned to them. It was just Shaman Zuma, Bard Mantashe, Ambassador Mbete, Executioner Mthethwa, the swordsmen and crossbowmen under the warrior Nhleko numbering in the thousands, and the Spymaster Cwele against the rampaging horde of rebels...",0
"(lone human...themselves? I'll keep it singular for simplicity.)
The study is posted all over the internet, and the world simply does not care. The functionality of a persons genome is beyond their daily concerns of collecting gadgets and raising their karma (not the good kind). However, a person of interest brings further intrigue to the whole shebackle.
This individual appears to have a completely functioning genome. Tests confirm this to be the truth, though not many people doubted it. All one needs for convincing is to lay eyes upon the grotesque figure that will burn its imagine into their minds for eternity.
The cost of a fully functional genome caused the *human* to grow a plethora of appendages, organs and develop entirely outdated traits from many previous stages of evolution. The functioning heap of genetic junk was charming to speak an outrageous lie. It was a beautiful depiction of every chaos that exists within biological creation.
Tears were shed for this poor creature and people around the world begged for its swift death, hoping to end its mostly assured pain and anguish.
But the beast doth protest! It claimed to live a full and happy life.
The masses called bullshit and wielded torch and pitchfork against the abomination. Marches organized around the home of the unfortunate one.
A sweet voice cried out to the people from below their waists. A young girl of four with eyes of green wept for the creature.
""Don't hurt him! He is one of us!""
""Nonsense!"" they spat.
""I have what remains of a tail. My mommy says that I am special!""
The red-eyed crowd chuckled at her innocence then rekindled their torches. Only then did the door to the monster's domain fling open. Emerging from within, the shuffling fiend objected to the little girl.
""But I am a woman, my dear child!""
Vomit spewed from the mouths of many and of the few remaining non-vomiters clutched themselves in terror.
""My beauty may not be what a normal man may seek, but my spirit is refined and glorious.""
Brows were furrowed and heads scratched. A single man placed his hand upon his hip and bellowed out.
""Ooooh. So you think you're better than us!""
An eruption of taunting of the foulest kind assaulted the ears of the dignity-clad creep.
""Not at all! I simply find no worth in focusing on my physical attractiveness. My joy is in life itself.""
Stillness gave way to the awkwardness, people began to cringe. By this time the crowd had thinned from loss of interest and a dramatic reduction in testosterone levels. A considerable mob remained clutching to their mob-things. A dramatically ugly fellow had a question brewing.
""What happiness is there for you if you are not loved?""
""On the contrary, I am loved deeply. My husband is inside. You should meet him.""
She slithered back into her home for a moment, emerging afterwards with an accompanying member. A gentleman walked out of the home, hand in hand with the wretched pustule. Breaths escaped and eyes beheld a man of considerable beauty.
""What the hell? How could you be with such a ghastly woman?"" a leading voice rang out with jealousy.
The man did not respond, could not respond. The hideous wretch explained.
""He has no sight, no hearing, or voice to speak of. But with me he can smile.""
The last of the weapons and fires dropped and dowsed. The mob had thrown in the towel and wiped their mouths clean and dried their eyes. They had all witnessed true beauty. The instance had overwhelmed the hearts of many that day. Some determined themselves to change for the better and pursue life with a new perspective. Others had made amends with those they had wronged beforehand.
However, this sentimentality did not last and the very next day every single person returned to lives of greed and debauchery with incredible enthusiasm. After all, these were the true workings of evolution.",0
"I can't take it anymore. I'm done.
They told me I was *lucky*, that I had a *gift*. **Lies**. What kind of gift is it to be locked in a concrete bunker ever since i was 5. Ever since the day I first...*jumped*. Leave it to the lackeys of the government to come up with most mundane possible name for teleporting. Leave it to them to tear apart a family so well that I have no memories of my real parents.
I have spent the last 20 years being experimented on, prodded, *harvested*. I have never seen the outside world, except through the 13 inch wide TV which lies beside my steel-frame bed. The only true piece of the world I've ever seen are the *stars*. Those beautiful orbs of wonder. A tiny slit was drilled into the top of the bunker for my 18th birthday. Not like I can escape through it anyways.
Well, at least not the escape they had in mind...
I've considered it many times. Almost daily. But the urge has always been strongest this time of the year. Every year on this day I stare though that slit for hours, wondering how strong I crave my freedom.
I'm done wondering.
I look up. Straight up. Beyond the 5 feet thick concrete, up into the utter vastness of space. The stars beckon to me, I can almost hear them calling out to me. My fists are clenched tight. I realise I've been holding my breath. I exhale strongly. *Not like a little air's gonna help me in a vacuum. * All my focus is now on the starry night sky and shutting my eyes for just a moment, I give in to their call.
I open my eyes with gasp, taking in a lot of air. *Space doesn't have air*, I think, just as I realise I'm falling.
I'm miles above earth, but miles below my planned destination. I'd vastly overestimated my abilities.
*Just another disappointment, but at least I'm gonna get my release anyway*.
The wind rushed past my ears as I fell through clouds, finally at peace. It must've been 0 degrees outside, but there was a warmth of sorts spreading throughout my body, leaving my toes tingling. I could see my concrete grave approach me rapidly. Just a few seconds before it was all over.
**5**
*Oh fuck, just a few seconds before this is all over. What have I done*
**4**
*Fuck, fuck, fuck! What was I thinking. GODDAMIT. It wasn't that bad there, was it? I could've still done something with my life. Maybe I could've found Mom and Dad. Oh crap, I'm never gonna see them. I'm never gonna see my mother and father*
My smile was gone, and there were two streams running across my face.
**3**
My life began to flash before me. My pitiful, slavelike life.
**2**
I know I've made the right choice. This is the closest I've come to *living* in my entire life. *Maybe I'll finally see you up there, Ma*.
I began to hum a familiar tune.
**1**
The ground was rushing up to meet me. To wrap me in an embrace and never let go. My smile returned. Taking a deep breath I began to sing,
""Happy Birthday to m-""

"There are days when the sun shines. It cascades through the leaves overhead, dappling the ground with the semi-starry yellow glow of morning as the wind shushes your mind and keeps you quiet, listening to the lovely sound of silence and birds. And there are days of rain, wet and cool, and cascading susurrance to lull you into a fall nap.
And there are days of darkness. Not the nighttime kind of darkness that wraps a person up for bed after sunset; more of a forced dark. A cruel dark. Unnatural. Divorce was like that. Unnaturally dark. And darker still when the custody fight over your sixteen year old son got wicked and petty. The fact that you won that fight didn't restore much of the light, either. It just made the cruel dark a little more tolerable.
It was on just such an unnaturally dark day that James McAdams, or Jimmy Mac as the guys at the poker called him, took his final call. He was navigating his car along Cal State Route 1, humming along to Cat Stevens' Angelsea as it played on the radio. A voice of crystal echo. He glanced above at the malevolent looking clouds that slowly gathered. Fuckin rain. Figures. So much for Davey's pool party. He'd been actually looking forward to his teenaged son's sixteenth birthday bash, and had just filled the pool for the occasion. But now it looked like it was going to be living rooms, rented DVD's and pizza instead of sunshine and barbecue. Meh, probably just as well. That kid would eat pizza every day if he could.
He slid through traffic, listening as Angelsea came to an end, and Strange Magic started up. Next to him on the passenger seat, his cellphone blipped. He reached around the shotgun rack beside his MDC terminal and picked it up, glancing at the display. It wasn't a number he recognized, so he flipped it open and affected the 'official tone.'
""Corporal McAdams,"" he said, announcing his police rank and last name as greeting. On the other end of the phone was only silence. He waited a beat, said, ""Hello?"" and then abruptly hung up. Not going to sit there crowing at nothing like a magpie. No time or patience for prank callers. Fuck 'em. He set the phone back down and slowed for a red light ahead. His cruiser drifted to a stop behind a beat up old red pickup. The phone blipped again.
McAdams picked it up again, and saw it was the same number. He scowled, flipped it open and said, ""McAdams!"" perhaps more loudly than he needed to.
""...Dad?"" a plaintive voice said. McAdams started and dropped the phone.
""What the-!"" that voice sounded just like Davey. He bent over awkwardly, his duty belt digging into a belly that his ex-wife had wished was a little less jelly-donut, sweeping his hand across the floor of the cruiser, blindly searching for the dropped phone. Just as his fingers found it, he heard it utter the 'beedle-beep' of a disconnected call. He pulled it up towards his face, and was about to say something into it when he discovered a man standing just outside his patrol car's driver's side window. His heart leapt up into his throat, and he dropped the everfucking phone again.
The man outside the window stared at him, smiling. It took McAdams a moment to gather himself, he'd been startled so badly. He rolled the window down and said, ""What are you doing, standing in the road like that, sir?"" and trying really hard to sound official. It didn't work too well.
The man said nothing. Just stood there, staring. McAdams glanced over his thin and too-tall frame, noting the dirty dreadlocked hair, pasty white bony complexion, and odd-looking tophat he wore. The red band across the base of the tophat was worn and ripped in places, as was his knotty tweed looking long jacket. The man's eyes were too-dark brown, and swam in rheumy whites. Teeth were straight, a bit yellowed, and far too big to seem normal. And eminating from him was a faint odor of fish.
McAdams blinked, realized he was staring like an idiot, and shook his head. ""Sir, get back in your car right now!"" he barked.
For a wonder, the apparition did as bid, turning slowly and padding forward to the driver's door of the ratty pickup. The tall man folded himself inside, the reverse lights blinked as he shifted into drive, and the truck trundled forward, spitting a cloud of smoke behind it. McAdams sat for a brief moment, watching the eerie truck motor away, and refusing to acknowledge how disquieted he suddenly felt, until the motorist behind him tapped his horn to encourage him to move forward.
From beneath the seat, McAdams' phone blipped again.
""Son of a..."" McAdams cursed under his breath and reached down again to retrieve the device. He opened it, and saw that this time it was a text message. From Davey.",0
"A few years ago, sis, my only living relative, fled to a foreign country. I was alone, and craving a bond to fill the void, I decided to get a clone, a child I could raise as my own. To my surprise, the scientists accepted my application and were even willing to subsidize the costs, in spite of my sister's criminal record. At the time, I didn't think anything of it.
A short time after, I was met with a surprise. According to the scientists, due to a random error in the process, the clone would develop as a female, instead of a male. I heard stories of such cases, but I had never expected such a thing to actually happen. Nonetheless, I continued ignoring the signs, too shocked to think anything of it.
But, as the girl grew up, I noticed her eerily similar appearance to my sister's baby pictures of the same age. At first I wrote it off as coincidence, the product of simple genetics. But, when her blonde hair faded to brunette exactly like sis' did, I started suspecting something. That's when I decided to take a test, comparing the three of our genetic samples.
""TEST IS COMPLETE. HERE ARE YOUR RESULTS. THANK YOU AND HAVE A NICE DAY.""
It's a mechanical voice from the other room, accompanied by the sounds of motors whirring. The girl sitting next to me jumps to her feet and runs to retrieve the printed items. When she returns, she holds them up to me with a big smile on her face.
""Daddy, here you go.""
I take the documents from the child and I give her a short pat on the head. Happy, she sits herself back next to me, digging her face into my arm.
""Daddy, what's that?""
""It...It's daddy's test results.""
""Is daddy sick?""
""No sweetie, daddy's not sick. Daddy's just seeing what the doctors found out.""
I grab the corner of the folder's front page, but my hand freezes. I'm scared, afraid of what I'll see. But, as if reading my emotions, the girl takes my arm and presses it against herself. She's warm.
""Daddy, are you okay?""
She asks with concern, her worried stare reaching heart.
...
I can't do this. I don't know what'll happen once I read this file. Maybe I'll find discover something scandalous, perhaps I won't find anything at all. But, this girl is my daughter, and I treasure her more than anything else in this world.
If knowing it means risking our precious bond, then the truth can go fuck itself.",0
"I stretched my legs for a moment as I pulled myself out of my beat-up old Toyota, and sighed deeply. The twelve-hour road trip from Connecticut to Kentucky had been, as usual, gruelingly uneventful, but I was glad that I had made the journey. The annual family events that my Aunt Stephanie threw were always legendary, and this year would be no exception. Family members were flying in from as far away as Italy to attend the party. As a broke college student without the funds to travel by plane, I had wrongly assumed that a boring, solitary road trip might help me ""find myself"" or something, but as usual, indie films had lied to me.
It didn't matter though; I was very excited for the day's upcoming events. There was always a ""theme"" for Aunt Stephanie's bashes, and this year's theme was pirates! I took a few long strides over to the back of my car, and enthusiastically popped my trunk open. My Jack Sparrow Halloween costume from 2003 was still in pristine condition, minus several small whiskey stains on the frayed, off-white collar. My plan was to surprise all of my aunts, uncles, and cousins with my detailed, meticulous shabby getup, and carefully honed drunken pirate dialect. My secret goals were to a) win the inevitable costume contest over my cousins, and b) insist that my prize be a beautiful bottle of bourbon.
I grabbed my carefully folded pirate clothes, slammed the trunk shut, and scrambled into the backseat of my Toyota to change into my gear. My car was parked in one of the abandoned lots that sprinkled my aunt's rather isolated countryside neighborhood, a few blocks from her house. I took the time to fluff my ruffled cuffs, and adjust my multiple scarf-belts. After applying thick kohl eyeliner (thanking the gods for that theater arts class elective in high school) I was ready to go.
I hopped in the front seat and drove the rest of the way to my aunt's house. Two blocks away, I could already hear the Top 40 music blaring from the backyard of her huge Kentucky dwelling. I even thought I could hear the joyous cries of the partygoers as I pulled into her half-mile-long driveway. My car approached the makeshift parking lot of my relatives' cars, which were strewn rather haphazardly across Aunt Stephanie's giant front lawn. I opened the window and honked, but received no reply--evidently everyone was in the backyard, enjoying the event. A summer breeze wafted towards me through my window, and my heart pumped with excitement. I gave myself a final once-over in the rearview mirror, and realized at once that something was missing. *My eye patch*, I thought hurriedly, and reached over to pull open the glove compartment, where my fancy, black and gold-lined eye patch was being stored. I pulled it over my head and let it go over my left eye. It hit my closed eyelid with a satisfying *snap*. I was ready!
I jogged through the summer heat towards the front door. Before my hand even touched the doorknob, I realized that something was off. The door was unlocked, and as I turned the handle, I shouted out ""Hello!"" to an empty abode. But all I heard was the loud backyard music echoing through the vacant living room, combined with the cries of joy, ringing even louder in my ears. Everyone must be having a *really* good time, I thought, as I strode through Aunt Stephanie's modest home. I strode across the carpet, trying not to stumble over the furniture with my newly obscured vision.
""Arrr, matey!"" I practiced to myself as I approached the sliding back door, and smiled wide as I slid open the door and raced into the backyard. ""ARRRR MATEY!"" I yelled to the backyard in general, with my eyes closed.
When I opened my right eye (the left eye covered by my pirate patch), I thought for a second that I must be having a flashback nightmare from all of the whiskey that I was prepared to consume at the party. My brain couldn't even begin to process what I was seeing. Slowly, my hand gripping the hilt of my fake sword for protection, the neurons fired in my head, and I started to attach names to the faces before me. *Billy Bob, Aunt Stephanie's oldest son. Face-down in the dirt being pegged by Uncle Ferb, his stepfather. The contorted look on Billy Bob's face as he moans in ecstasy. No, this can't be happening. * My terrified eye traveled up Uncle Ferb's arm, his wrist, his hand, which was half-deep into my cousin Julia's kittty. Julie had a tank top on, but nothing on her bottom, and she was seated in a chair as close as possible to her father and brother's position. Her head was thrown back, and she was gripping the chair as hard as I was gripping the hilt of my sword.
My feet stumbled backwards into the house, and before I knew it, I had tumbled over my aunt's leather couch. I was in the living room. I started to retch. I crawled on all fours into the kitchen. I leaned against the fridge, breathing hard, my stomach dropping painfully. Minutes passed. I started to think it was possible that no one heard me. But I couldn't walk back outside. I could barely breathe, and more than anything I longed to shut everything, including reason, out of my unyielding head. I turned and stared blankly, without seeing, the platters of food set out for all of the incoming family guests on the kitchen table and counter. Suddenly I spotted something that made me have a physical reaction. I reached towards the counter and grabbed the thick glass bottle of bourbon. My eyes, now filled with confused tears, focused on the label. It read *Costume Contest Winner, from Aunt Steph! * I could barely feel anything as my hands struggled to twist open the bottle. I lifted my head to drink, and the rest, I don't remember.
When I opened my eyes, a splitting headache was there to greet my senses. I was in darkness, nestled in a bed that I immediately recognized was in a bedroom in Aunt Stephanie's house. I scrambled to get my body up, out of the room, out of the house, away, but my legs were slow to cooperate. A light flicked on, and my forehead instantly started to throb.
""Hey"", said a soft voice. It was my Aunt Stephanie. I squinted at her and barely managed to nod silently. She smiled, and then she laughed. ""You--u lush! Don't worry, I won't tell your mother.""
""I --"" I stammered. I wasn't sure what to say. I decided to avoid most subjects I would have brought up. But my aunt was still chattering.
""You silly goose, I think you got the time wrong for the party. You were a couple of hours *early* for our party. The family was still setting up.""
She paused, and gave me a nudge. She whispered, ""You know, part of me thinks that you came by early on purpose just to get a head start on the booze. I know how you college kids are."" She winked and continued. ""Your uncle and cousins were hanging out in the yard, and we didn't hear you come in over the music. I was out there too, because Scottie had escaped again and I was looking at her in the woods, that rascal dog! But I found her after a minute. And when we all came inside a while later, we found you passed out on the kitchen floor, and we all had ourselves a good laugh!""
I sat there, still squinting in the too-bright light, utterly confused. For appearances' sake, I decided to smile a little and nod.
""Well"", said my aunt, patting my leg affectionately, ""Come down when you feel ready and join the party. Everyone's here! And when you're ready, we have your eye patch for when you want to be a pirate for us."" Aunt Steph giggled like a little girl, and added, ""You know, when I was younger, my mom used to tell me that I was magical, and if I hold my hand over my left eye, my right eye could see all the wrongs of mankind. How bizarre, now that I think about it. But I guess if you wear an eye patch all the time, I imagine you'd have a weird, permanent sin-vision."" She shrugged, and stood up, walking towards the door.
My heart rate sped up at this impossible statement. I was too old to believe in superstitious stories like this, but if that were true, it was the only way that my aunt would be ignorant of the sexual interrelationships of her family. My heart burned for her, and my stomach felt sick, as I allowed myself for a few moments to believe that my eye patch had somehow revealed the truth of this family to me. How could Uncle Ferb and my cousins betray my poor Aunt Steph this way?
I stood up angrily and walked to the door, ready to have it out with my uncle and cousins in front of everyone. I heard voices and put my eye to the crack. It was my left eye this time, but I could still see the truth. My Aunt and Julie stood in the unlit hallway.
""Could you hand this back to your cousin when he gets up? He's in Billy Bob's room,"" said my aunt in a low voice.
""Sure"", purred Julie. My aunt kissed her deeply and smacked her ass, and then made her way downstairs to the party.",0
"Fond memories came to me in dream-like visions as I held my mother's hand. The steady rhythm of the machines that were struggling to keep her alive faded away. In its place, I heard my scampering footsteps through the kitchen and smelled the sweet, salty aroma of freshly baked cookies. My mother, much younger, stood in front of a piping hot oven in her cooking garb. Carefully she carried the cookies to a waiting tray to cool before quickly swatting my hand as I moved to steal a molten morsel. The scene skipped ahead to us sharing a cookie at the table, it was beginning to cool as was my mother's hand.
""Hey,"" I said, gently shaking my mother's shoulder as the vision broke. ""Hey, would you tell me how you used to make those cookies?""
""What?"" she asked weakly. ""Of all things, why now?""
""Because that's how I remember you best,"" I replied with tears in my eyes.
""Hmm,"" she said, turning her head away from me. She continued thinking for a time as coughs rattled her thin frame. ""No. I think it's best that we let it die with me, son.""
""But-why?!"" I replied, shaking my head fiercely in disagreement. I was surprised by just how much this meant to me. ""Everyone loved your cookies! I loved making them with you and sharing them with you, don't you remember-""
""Now, you know I do,"" she interrupted with a reassuring pat on the back of my hand.
""Please, mom"" I pleaded. ""It's all I want. Share with me one last time.""
""Alright, but don't say I didn't warn you,"" she relented as she struggled to turn her body towards me. ""Grab that pad and pen there and get to writing.""
""Okay,"" I said, hastily scooping the items from her bedside stand as she broke into another fit of coughing. This time it was productive. Her hands were stained red as I watched in horror. ""Mom-""
""Listen up, I'm only going to get to tell you once before I croak,"" she said in her old tone with a slight smile on her haggard face. ""You'll want 2 cups flour, not that self-rising stuff. The all-purpose kind. A quarter of a teaspoon of salt. Go fine on that one. I know you like your coarse salt. Oh, and keep it table. I never cared for that sea salt. Now, this last ingredient is the most important, have you kept up with me so far?""
""Yes, ma'am,"" I said as I furiously scribbled her every word.
""Good. You're going to want a human heart,"" she continued. ""Get it as fresh as you can now, those stale hearts make the cookies go south in a hurry. There's just something about the consistency and taste of a good, fresh heart. You can't beat 'em.""
""Mm-hmm, okay,"" I said to myself as I wrote down her words without question, without thought. She settled down on her back once again as her breathing slowed. I didn't notice as I read over my notes. Something seemed a little off to me. The noises in the background began to die out as she took her final breath. I saw her chest rise and fall for the final time on the edges of my vision as I reached that last line. ""Hey! Wait! You can't go! You didn't tell me how to prepare it!""
Her chest fell still and she said no more.
""No! I'll never know what temperature to bake them on or how long they're supposed to cook, mama!"" I cried as I cradled her in my arms. Our greatest family recipe was forever lost to me.

"A man smiled as he saw a package underneath his mailbox. He lifted the box with a groan, it was rather heavy, almost...human-like. Smiling with the thought, he went back in his dull gray house. The box struggled as the man slaughtered it with a knife, exposing its content inside. If there was blood inside this box, it would look like the Mexican Caravel sent him a message as there was limbs cluttered inside.
He picked up a leg, placed it on top a large blue sheet. Once all of the limbs were in place, he begin to attach ropes that were close to the edge of the porcelain skin before he attached the jointed steel where the bones would be. Once he finished attaching the head. It came to life. ""Oh boy! Thank you for picking me! What did you want to call me, brother? Son?"" It froze, awaiting my answer.
""Best friend."" I spoke, trying to make it clear.
""Best friend? You sure?""
""Yes.""
""Downloading best friend sequence..."" It was still frozen. ""10%"" It spoke. ""20%...30%..."" I waited until it was done. ""100%"" It squeaked to life. ""Hello! What's your name?""
""Harold.""
""Hello 'Harold'! What shall we do today?"" It didn't said my name through its pipsqueak sound, it recorded my voice and played it back to me.
""I want you to come with me. I want us to do something fun today.""
""Ok!"" We both stood up, walked outside in the dark cloudy day.
""Weather patterns detected. 'Harold' we can't stay outside for long. I don't do well in rain.""
""Don't worry BuddyTron. Where we're going, there won't be any rain.""
""Sounds awesome, 'Harold' Can't wait to get there!"" We boarded onto my car and drove, watching the buildings whizzing by until skyscrapers slowly rolled by us. We stopped and entered one of the buildings.
The metal door squeaked open, revealing a small room. We entered it and pressed the confusing columns of buttons next to the metal door. The metal door squeaked closed and the room jolted upward, sending uneasy feelings down Harold's spine. The uneasiness stopped, and the metal door squeaked open once more. We walked out and into my office. ""This is my office, BuddyTron, this is where we would have our fun.""
""Ok! What shall we do today, 'Harold'!""
Harold picked up a chair and threw it through the large windows. ""'Harold'! I detected danger, are you OK?""
""Don't worry about that, BuddyTron. I have a story to tell you.""
""Oh boy! A story!"" It chimed happily. Harold held the porcelain hand and stood at the edge of the window.
""All my life I've been an asshole. I was a narcissistic, I loved myself and no one else. I was a leech, I made fun of people until they cry, then I would smile because I made them cry. One would even call me a psychopath, because I manipulated people to get my way. My office here? I blackmailed the CEO, he was sleeping around with whores while being married. Recently I gotten rather sick, so I went to the hospital..."" Harold trailed off. Tears rolling down his eyes. ""I have cancer.""
""'Harold'...I'm detecting suicidal thoughts from you. Do you want me to contact the local suicide hotline?""
""No, BuddyTron. I needed a friend, I needed to tell this to someone. I needed to die, so all of the victims I have would laugh. All the victims would smile and would feel free. You, BuddyTron, are the only friend I have, and...I don't want to die alone. BuddyTron, concern mode unactivated.""
""Concern mode unactivated."" It spoke in a monotonously. ""What do you want to do today!"" It spoke again, in a chippy mode.
""I want to die, but not alone.""
""Ok."" It understood. We both took step forward and closed our eyes.

"I am a cruel human. I have committed unspeakable acts against all that is pure and if I should die for it, then I accept my fate. For there is no undoing of the things I've done.
A door shuts behind me. I'm in a different room now and I've been sat in a chair that is cold to the touch. I shiver alone, sitting there in silence and reflecting on what has brought me to this chair.
Man, and woman, live by rules. Rules, whether they be religious, intrinsic, natural, or self-imposed, govern our lives. I lived and still live by some combination of the aforementioned. But, my will is not always strong. We endure external pressures that some can absorb but others cannot, like a home absorbing storm after storm, they begin to break down and weather---some sooner than others. Our restraint and control is not much different. I don't know if my control is predisposed to weakness, is there some flaw that is unknown to me and only needed substrate for a reaction? I feel remorse and as my fingers clasp the cold arms of the chair it is not them that reach into my soul and make me shiver again but the guilt I bear.
The door opens and closes behind me and the lights flicker on. I can see.
The chair is exactly as I envisioned, stainless steel and positioned in the middle of a room that has a table of similar design in front of me with a small drain in floor below it. The room is cold and about twice the size of my cell. There is a door on the far side of the table, an exit to where I do not know.
On the table is a sealed brown envelope placed near center and adjacent to it is a silver letter opener with a robust ebony handle fused to the blade. I reach for both. The paper knife slides through the seal with ease and I empty the contents onto the table. A passport with my picture but a different name and a letter.
As I read the letter my eyes begin to water yet my shoulders sag, as if my sins were sponges rested upon them absorbing the anguish leaking from me. I stare up at the door. It is an exit to life. To a new beginning where I can mend the damage I've caused. It is a opportunity to see my family. To be a daughter, a sister, and a mother again.
I place the letter down on the table beside the glistening blade. Darkness enters my thoughts. The shame begins to swell and my moral compass spins in the hurricane. I wade through to the center of the storm and in that moment of calmness reach for my exit. While departing all I remember hearing is the sound of a drain filling with my guilt.",0
"""It's not your fault. You couldn't have known.""
Those were the last words of the woman I called my enemy. The last words she said before she pulled the trigger, staining her red hair a deeper shade of red.
I stared out of the window of the highrise building that held her office. Outside the building the fires burned, the people screamed, and the world called my name. How could I tell them that the same people that gave me my Suit were the ones that caused this destruction?
I took my helmet off and dropped it to the floor, the heat was too much to handle. Her particular brand of anarchy could have saved us from this genocide, this extinction, if only I hadn't stopped her.
I laugh at the irony, louder and louder until the tears flow down my face. Everything is wrong. I can't get her last words out of my head. The last bit of kindness from a woman I wrote off as evil. I wonder if she knew what she would be doing to my mind when she said that.
In the end it's the perfect moment. The moment of closeness I never felt with another. Everything from her last words, the half smile, and the fact that the gun she left behind still had a few more bullets in it.
""It's not my fault. I couldn't have known.""
I smile to the empty room, and wonder fleetingly if there will be anyone left to miss me.",0
"It was cold, and damp, and miserable. A reasonably normal day in the south east of England around this time of year. Men and women in white overalls were scouring the scene for evidence whilst others were planting down number markers and taking photos.
""Inspector?"" a voice cut through the still mist as Greaves stomped up the hill and showed his badge to the officer manning the police tape.
""What've we got?"" Greaves grumbled. The morning coffee not having kicked in quite yet and he was still blinking the sleep out of his eyes.
""Double homicide"" replied the officer ""Male and female of around the ages twenty. We're still running identity checks so for now they're just going down as Jack and Jill respectively. Forensics hasn't gotten into the cause of death as there's no apparent blood or wounds on the individuals which leads us to believe it could have potentially been a poisoning"". The younger officer took off her cap and smoothed her blonde hair. Greaves estimated her to be around the age of 30, stress lines around her eyes suggested that she wasn't getting much sleep.
As they approached the white tent covering the bodies they were intercepted by a well dressed gentleman. Swinging his cane as he walked, his suit appearing surprisingly dry considering the weather. He reached his hand out to shake the Inspectors and smiled a toothy, well practiced grin.
""Ah! Inspector, I was hoping to meet you before we got to the uh..."" He paused for a moment, his eyes darting to the tent for a second ""...Gristly details. I'll be working with you on this case. My name's Gregory, Gregory Coffyn. I'm one of the Abled.""
The 'Abled' as they'd come to have been known were something that still remained to be a mystery to modern science. Throughout history despite the advances in technology, medicine and the physical sciences the Abled had been very much on the paranormal end of things. Unexplained occurrences such as floating lights, sounds that had no source and floating objects tended to be manifestations of such individuals. The majority of them were unable to correctly attune themselves before maturity and as a result were never quite able to get a grasp on their abilities. However those that did became extraordinarily talented in whatever specialties they focused themselves on. They also became a great asset, or a greater threat.
""Ah!"" Smiled Greaves ""and what's your parlor trick?"". Gregory raised an eyebrow and pursed his lips as he assessed the detective. He stared at Greaves for a moment before finally, almost reluctantly admitting ""I'm good with time"". Greaves made a face ""Time?"" he asked apparently unimpressed at the explanation. ""Can you maybe unpack that for me? Us normal folk don't quite understand whatever witchcraft, sorcery or magic you might do"". Gregory shifted uncomfortably and looked down at his shoes whilst tapping his cane on the grass. He pulled out a pair of gloves from his pocket, runes sewn into the fabric. Gold thread weaved into the soft leather forming intricate symbols of power that helped the Abled focus their talents. ""How about we get to it and I'll demonstrate as we go"" Sighed Gregory as he lifted his cane to indicate the tent ""after you"".
Greaves grunted and stomped over to the tent. He lifted up the canvas flap and stepped inside.

"""How fucking hard is it!"" I screamed at her face and slammed the cup down on the table. The knot in my stomach tightened, it had been a long since I accidentally drank a DCCCFw/S but I still remembered the consequences. Vividly!
In my rage I wanted to scream more, but as I opened my mouth the contents of my knotted stomach unleashed itself all over the baristas face. She was covered in my stomach's opinion of her mistake. What a fool.
Somehow I calmed down, I called my mother, the only person I have ever formed a relationship with because of my endless list of allergies. I held the phone to my barf covered face and said ""it happened again, Soy this time, if I don't make it I want you to know, I love you.""
The last thing I saw was a shocked barista, covered in a whitish yellowish bile and then everything faded.
...
I awoke with the sensation of a tube down my throat, and squinted into a fluorescent light while my memory came back. I remember, the Starbucks, the DCCCFw/S. I slowly sat up and saw my mother and the girl who served me the deadly coffee. She looked upset and held flowers, her face no longer had my stomach lining on it.
My mother started crying, tears of relief and the star bucks worker apologised, handing me the flowers. ""Let me make it up to you"" she said, ""let me take you out to dinner some time"".",0
"If you're looking for a creation story, this isn't it. This is the story of how you find a way not to un-create yourselves.
In the beginning, there were a few people. We don't know how many. They were probably brave and strong and weak and normal and dorky and silent and brutal and kind. These people lived somewhere difficult, where the possibility of eking out their existence was far more brutal than your living daily grind with your warm trains and your flying planes and your instant, daily communication with all corners of the globe. Life was slower. Life was harder. Life was better.
This world is not mean to be easy; you have deluded yourselves. This is why you collectively fantasise your own end constantly and repeatedly. Every two years a new apocalypse that never quite seems to materialise.
There is too much food. There is too much time. You are too comfortable. It is destroying you.
The only way is to find a way back is to consciously bring in the difficulties that your genes were forged in. You must not be always warm. You must feel cold, true, aching, and shivering cold...from time to time. You must feel true thirst. You must feel true hunger. You must bring these things unto yourselves, for the world you've created makes it all to easy to sit eating, fattening, in a warm house on a street with a car and a pet and some sparkly, cold diamonds to show your wealth.
Experience is wealth. Discomfort will set you free. You long to test yourself, to quest, to walk with your own feet a thousand miles.
In the beginning, you were humans. See to it that in the end you will so be.",0
"*Well today is the day I die. Well it might as be a great day to day then. * I thought those words as I sat inside the interior of a hollowed out husk of an asteroid. The thing weighted several million tons and was a solid spherical chunk of iron - forged by years of cooling. I knew that if the thing hit the earth it'll change the course of history very quickly, however I had something in particular in mind.
I've always desired to rise above the average man, as a testament to my almighty greatness. No one shall not know my name and nobody shall not be effected by what I have done. I want to spite those infernal gods who sentenced me to die however they didn't say how I needed to die. I'm still following their ultimately random commands which have now cursed me to die.
I picked up my microphone and began live streaming. ""Hello people of earth and the alien bastards to want me to die today. I will die today but not in the way you might expect. Right now I'm heading to the planet at 9% of light speed being flung around a black hole. And right now this rock I'm on will hit this pathetic speck of a planet in Antarctica with the force of a solar flare. This planet will be damaged to the point where its axis is tilted and the seas will drown you all. And that's is you survive the shockwave and the force of the energy transferring into your pathetic bodies. My name is Heinrich Hitler, now prepare to die in a few minuets time.""",0
"He injected the sleeping two year old again - better safe than sorry. He didn't want the little one waking up.
Or crying.
Not one little bit.
He'd lose his powers if that happened. Curse those capes! Those meddling do-gooders. They could do nothing right. Even, this fool--This fool stupidity of a punishment! It was a useless punishment. Pointless! Was he not Mordor the Destructor still? Did he not lead the Brimstone Council still?
His fists clenched with rage. Then, with a snort, he strapped the child onto his back.
In his lair it was a near-meaningless gesture; the child wasn't going anywhere. He'd taken the child's feet and then it's hands to ensure that.
Still-
A single red beam flew.
All was night.
With dimming eyes he looked up at his attacker.

Why would the Brotherhood of Evil attack him? This would mean war.

"MICAH is a full AI humanoid with no mechanical parts. His body was actually made from Data Matter.
Data Matter is like matter, but easier to manipulate via electrical signals. And this matter can be used to form different matter. It can be as hard as titanium and suddenly as liquid-ish as mercury in a split second. His body isn't the only impressive thing he has.
His ‘ mind'or his Core, located deep in the head of his body, is the only thing that isn't made from Data Matter since it is the thing that manipulates the Data Matter. His Core is programmed by Dr. Goldman, the best software scientist known to mankind. MICAH, or Micah, is the fruit of all of Dr. Goldman's research. Micah's Core is programmed exactly like how a human brain functions and he even has feelings.
Even though Dr. Goldman's project MICAH sounded like a good idea, there were some factions of people who opposed the idea. Some said that Dr. Goldman was playing God. Some said that Dr. Goldman would wipe out humanity when Micah felt the need to wipe out humanity who were actually destroying Mother Nature.
One night, when Micah was in his charging bay taking a break from a hard day's work of helping Dr. Goldman's research. Micah heard something that woke him up from his sleep. His eyes scanned were like clockwork as he scanned the room for the source of the noise. There was a loud bang, followed by a loud thud. Micah's processor could only come out with one scenario – Dr. Goldman's being shot at.
Micah literally dashed through the lab, towards Dr. Goldman's bedroom.
There he was, standing on a pool of some sort of thick liquid Micah never seen before. He activated his sensors on his legs. Blood. He felt a new sensation he never felt before. Was this the human emotion panic that Dr. Goldman taught him? He looked up and saw Dr. Goldman's limp body on the floor. His optic sensors switched into X-ray mode. Dr. Goldman's heart wasn't moving.
He ran towards Dr. Goldman. He quickly extracted the bullet out and filled the bullet wound with Data Matter in attempt to clot the blood. Micah placed his palms on Dr. Goldman's chest, output set to 300 volts. Dr. Goldman's body jumped from the shock.
450 volts. Dr. Goldman's body jumped again.
500 volts. Dr. Goldman's body merely jumped.
Even Micah's Core lost count on how many times he had tried to rescue his creator. Dr. Goldman's gone…
Micah could still remember that scene vividly like it happened yesterday since he had unlimited memory storage. Micah wore his hoodie as he blended into the crowd. He needed to find the murderer of his creator. He grasped the bullet he extracted tightly. He will have his revenge.",0
"Demitri slicked his oily hair back so the part was nice and even. Being the taxi service for lost souls was no fun anymore, after years of pleading for mercy before being sent into the pits of hell, he hoped to find someone who wouldn't beg him for mercy, that's where his Demon virtues ran out. Letting out a frustrated sigh, he made his way up the hotel elevator, his destination.. Room 316. A young man had taken his own life after being rejected from a marriage proposal. ""Damn sentiment. Gets 'em every time."" He said as he read his objective list, his boss, Satan. Had a bad habit sometimes of being a bit of a micromanager, making sure everything went EXACTLY as planned.
By the time Demitri was on the floor of the ""stiff"" Liza was just arriving at the scene of her next pickup for the man upstairs. She was dressed in a white evening dress with fur neckline. Liza, an angel whose afterlife consisted of floating and squeaky clean living.. White was becoming a bit overused. Hell..She said Hell! How exhilarating! Hell, white was the big guy's favorite color! But she had a wonderful afterlife, minus the work.. She hated this part. Having to play judge for the lost souls, even if they went upstairs or down. Both parties were required to be present by celestial order, or some silly tripe like that, what she wouldn't give to run away and do something exciting again! She straightened out her dress and hastily made her way to the room. Room 316.
Demitri was lazily spinning in the office chair, avoiding any work that could be done. Not that he didn't want to, he'd love nothing more than to send this poor sap into the brimstone and be on his way, maybe he could enjoy himself up here for a while. Y' know, just enjoy being on the lobby floor of the universe for a while. ""I know there was a 'Do not disturb' sign on the door, but in your case, I'll make an exception."" He smiled up at her with eyes that could see through any poker face. Liza did not return the coy greeting. ""let's just get to work. These sort of things don't give us pleasure upstairs as it must give you all on the bottom floor."" She said not even looking at him, but pulling out a small golden book. Demitri knew if anyone would understand what he was going through, it would be an angel. He couldn't get any lower, so he gave it a shot. ""Liza, do you like this? Do you enjoy the afterlife?"" He said.. Demitri the demon asked Liza the Angel with sincerity in his dark eyes.",0
"**Prolgue: Landfall**
""Damn this fog and damn this weather!"" I cursed, My ""ship"", or what so passed laughably as my ship floated on the soft waters of the Atlantic, I checked my wristwatch and sighed, it was already midday but the fog made it harder to see if it was actually midday,
When I went to the nearest Volunteer Workers Outpost and presented them a plan to go west, they did not even bother to look at my file before sending me away. I wasn't that type of person to give up easily you know, so I tried again with The Exploratory Corps, The Navy and even The Government. but the more I pestered them, The more I was rejected. I've tried every different organization and I was rejected,
Not until I was approached by a eccentric and somewhat weird guy named Frederick Magnusson, He had heard about my proposals and wanted to support me in my plan and would supply me with weapons, supplies and a sailboat, a crappy one that was, The damn thing was fourth generation and looked like it was going to sink at the slightest touch. But getting rejected again was not part of my bucket list so I accepted his offer. There were many instances that the sailboat would capsize on it's own weight but thankfully, that did not happen
But it was still areal surprise that I managed to survive the long journey from the United States of Africa to the desolate wasteland that is the former United States of America, It has been a long time since ""The Day"", ever since the dead started to rise, the world was never the same again. Pakistan had a panic attack and started detonating their nukes. Thailand became a absolute monarchy, China renamed itself into Cathay for some reason, Israel and Gaza, surprisingly united into one state, I hear the Islamic and Jewish People's Party won a landslide victory against the Zionist Union, and Italy fractured into two states. The progressive and large ""Second Roman Empire"" and the theocratic ""Democratic People's Republic of Sicily"", crazy right?
But hey, at least it isn't as crazy as Nazara and the Quisling Movement, Nazara was this creepy political organization that supported the idea of a one world government. Their ideas may be attractive but their organization isn't, I mean they attend meetings in giant marble fortifications named ""Watchtowers"". They dress in military esque uniforms and always speak like it's the 18th century, The Quisling Movement however is a different thing entirely.
It's a religious movement started by some guy named Simone Harald, The Quisling Movement aimed to 'unite' the human genome with the zombie genome, they also added that this would be the only way to enter Heaven, their argument was that the your souls would be so pitiful that God would take pity on your soul that he'd open the pearly gates so they could enter en masse. something as crazy as this would be branded as 'ship to nearest mental asylum' right? WRONG! They manged to fetch a LOT of followers, especially in area that took worst of the undead storm. They ain't only crazies, they are also committed terrorists, they bombed a lot of places and committed random acts of violence to spread ""The Word"", But with all the violence and all, trying to shut The Q Movement down would be useless, they were far too organized and had a lot of popularity points with Third World oil-rich nations.
My thoughts drifted away as the squawking of sea gulls ripped through the quiet fog-infested ocean, it may not be so bad after all, if there were seagulls then the coast would be near, I grabbed a pair of binoculars that was laying on a table and dashed towards the front of the boat. I waited as the fog started to die down, I then lifted the binoculars to my eyes and gazed at the distance......
It was then I saw it, I saw the unmistakable stretch of land, the long vast stretch of green, the unmistakable skyline, I swear a tear fell from my eye as I lowered the binoculars and took out a small video camera. I activated it and directed it towards the dark coast,
""Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to say this, America has been rediscovered, I repeat, America has been rediscovered""",0
"This was the 42nd time we redid the referendum.
By now, everybody was just tired with the whole thing and wanted to get it over with.
It was clear the eurocrats were not humans, but machines that would never give an inch until the outcome of the vote was right.
It was clear that all the SJWs would bully everyone into submission by flooding their facebook and twitter accounts.
As for me, I don't have social media accounts. I don't even have TV in my neck of the woods. I only know I was determined to keep voting Leave until the bitter end.
That morning, the results had all come in and the result was finally overwhelmingly in favor of the EU. So crushing was the defeat that the whole night it looked like it would be a 100% victory, even though the turnout was barely above the required 75%, many people having just given up and just decided to hide in their basements to not be rounded up to vote in the camps.
However, one person, in one small village in Wales, the village of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, had voted to leave the EU.
I knew they would come for me. Even though their victory was total, they would not tolerate even a small stain on it. But I was prepared. I had stashed food, ammunitions for my AR-15, and I had mustered all my courage and resolution for this final showdown.
Rule Britannia! Rule the waves! Britons never will be slaves!",0
"He woke up with cracked lips and the taste of iron on his tongue. Rubbing a pain from his neck, he pushed himself up from the couch, a headache rushing to greet him like an unrelenting wave; he was parched.
After a few moments, he trudged to the faucet across the room and placed a cup under it, setting the plunger in its place over the drain as a precaution. He turned the knob and...nothing. Right. His tank had run out three days past, a detail shrouded by the steady throbbing in his head.
And there would be no relief. Rains hadn't come for over a decade and efforts to resupply any region within a thousand miles of the equator had been abandoned. The heat was intense, the solar flares constant and unabated. Radiation had driven the land to desolation. And the population had moved on, searching for respite closer to the poles as any sane person would. But he couldn't, not while she was still here.
He looked out the window above the sink, glancing at the carved flagstone set upright in the shadow of his old barn across the way. The rust-colored dirt spreading to the horizon was an easy testament to the harshness of it all. His fists clenched at the thought of his past, and pushed away from the counter toward the door.
He stepped outside, the early sun's gaze nearly searing his flesh. He looked toward the flagstone again and made his way over, sitting beside the mound in front of it and read the inscription:
*Dearest Alexandria Ensel*
*Beloved wife, you are my everything*
Thirteen years it had been, and each day he had spent time by her grave, with that time growing ever longer since the migrations. He hadn't much else to do, after all.
""I've finally ran out, Alex. No more food, no more water. Soon we shall meet again to the sight of green pastures and blue skies. I have longed for it, though I have been afraid. Please, take my hand now and guide me to our new world.""
He knew she wouldn't be fond of his decisions. Her words a few weeks before she passed kept coming back to him. ""*Live, * James. I will be there to pull you through the gates, when the time comes. But do not waste yourself in grief or guilt. Travel. Learn. Do not stay here."" Well, he was selfish and he hadn't left. He couldn't leave.
Tears tried to come, but all was dry. In a moment, blackness took him...
He awoke once more to the sun directly overhead, frustration building within him. He rolled to his knees and looked at the grave once more. ""I'm ready. Take me, give me salvation!"" he yelled, slamming the side of his clenched fist on packed dirt, and it *sunk in, * coming out lathered in mud.
He reeled back, shocked. How long it had been since he felt wet. Furrowing his brows, he crawled back and plunged a finger into the small patch that was already shrinking in the heat. It was so cool. He spread the mud on his forearm and readied his fist for another pound, too exhausted to consider the true oddity of what he had done. This time, as it swung, he saw a trail of particles arcing behind his fist, as if materializing out of the air. He stopped the swing and the particles caught up, dousing his arm and creating a light sheen.
He glanced at the grave, hopelessness taking him. He heard her words repeating again, *Do not stay*.
""So this is to be my deliverance,"" he said. And he knew she was right. What use to give up on his world, their first home? It was not fair for her, and he had wasted far too long in the realization. ""I'm sorry, Alex.""
He licked the water evaporating from his arm, yielding instant relief and offering him a renewed vigor. He reached both hands toward the sky, feeling the water drifting, minute. He grasped, and *pulled, * collecting the water into a small ball before him. It floated there, shifting in the air until he directed it into his mouth, letting it slosh around before swallowing.
He patted the grave and stood slowly, making his way toward the barn. Years of dust shook off the tarp as he uncovered his old motorcycle. He had kept it in case he ever found the courage to leave, a long abandoned prospect. He filled the tank and set the spare gas into a storage container attached to the back, where he found two cans of beans and some wax-covered cheese that he had forgotten about. It would have to do. He just hoped he could find some additional materials along the way. Fortunately, the engine started and he had naught but gas, beans, cheese, and the clothes on his back to take. And, evidently, water anywhere he could draw it from. He took the bike out front and looked once more at the grave, kneeling to collect some dirt in his hands. ""When we meet again, I shall have many stories for you.
""Goodbye Alexandria.""",0

"I wrung my tired hands as I watched the clock tick forward. I was due to give my speech at 3 PM, Eastern Standard Time. Right now, it was 2:47 PM. As I sat here at my desk, I thought back to the past few weeks, where one after the other, delegates and leaders and representatives of the United Nations shook my hand and wished me luck. Each word was worthless. I saw the helplessness in their eyes and they must have seen it in mine.
The Greater American president was the last people I waved out of the door. Before he left, he pulled me in for a tight hug. I could feel the weight of the world pass off of his shoulders and onto mine. While he never had control over more than half of a continent, I think I could relate to him more than anyone else. I was soon to inherit the entire world. I waited for a moment in his arms, and he in mine. I suppose we both expected some exchange of words. There were none.
The date is October the 11th, 2067. The time is now 2:56 PM. The United Nations officially declared that I was the world leader in the face of an impending apocalypse. All military power, all governing bodies, even the economy must answer to me now. On my agenda, for now, was one thing: address the remaining population of Earth. At 3 PM, I go live to the masses. Laid before me is a rough script full of talking points I can barely bring myself to face. My arms are shaking. I take some Xanax. My prescription has been getting heavier lately, and it shows in my face, my walk, and in my voice. I don't think I even care anymore.
The sparse camera crew set in the office jolts me from my trance. ""Paul,"" says the man running the broadcast, ""fifteen seconds and you're live."" I sighed, and sat up straight. I wiped the sweat off my brow as he count down from five. ""Five. Four. Three."" He motioned now with his hands, two, one, point. The planet Earth, as well as the various refugee ships able to pick up the signal, is now at his attention.
""People of Earth, I greet you and thank you for tuning in. My name is Paul Abrams, and I have been delegated by the United Nations to lead you for the months to come. As many of you know, an asteroid impact due to arrive in seven month's time has the potential to cause an impact winter, blocking the sun from lighting and heating the earth for many years. We have sent off billions of humans to our galactic colonies, and unfortunately not all of us could make the trip."" I allowed a break not for the audience, but for myself. My family did not make it onto any ship. My wife, my children, even my parents were probably huddled somewhere in a New York slum, listening to my broadcast. No one could find it possible to take them to a colony, not even the UN officials that worked so closely with me, not even after I was elected leader of over a hundred million damned souls could my loved ones make it off.
""As a result, there will be a great change in how the laws and doctrines of the world work. The United Nations have worked together in the time we had to devise a plan for those of us left to brave it out."" I cleared my throat, and looked down at the list in front of me. ""We have began building, in suitable areas, large underground shelters able to fit ten thousand people, along with enough rations to feed them for up to a year. In addition, each shelter will be fitted with its own garden that can provide for our nutritional requirements should the need arise."" Thank god for the hydroponics boom. ""A list of shelters can and will be made available to you by your regional governments in the passing weeks. All shelters will close two weeks before the scheduled arrival of the asteroid.""
A lump rose in my throat as I went on. ""Military personnel will be dispersed to major population areas ('Were there even any left?' I thought to myself) to insure the stability of the area and the long-term survival of your regional government. Keeping order will be very important, and disruption of the order will result in a very strict crackdown on any movements seeking to work against the greater good. Patrols will be sent out into more rural areas on a weekly basis to ensure that all are safe and in compliance with mandatory protocol."" Another pause.
""In the coming weeks, local hospitals will offer euthanization services for those who seek them."" I let out a shaky breath. ""Regional governments, if they choose to, may also seek the euthanization of people deemed unable to fully contribute to society during the impact winter."" I shuddered in disgust, but I knew the intentions were objectively good. The mentally ill and physically handicapped had no place in the shelters. Who would care for them? What could they be if not another mouth to feed? I hoped, at the very least, each one would get their own marked grave.
""We must unite as a world to get through this event. We cannot spread terror. We cannot war each other to death. Working together is the only way for the human race to survive on this planet. I sincerely hope that we persevere as a people, and can do the best we can. May God bless you, and thank you."" The camera's red light faded out. I couldn't help but explode into tears. *This is it, * I thought. *You're the ringleader for the greatest circus in the universe. *

"The doctor stumbled his way in and dropped his clipboard. Picking it up and holding it upside down, the man quickly tried to scan the paper and look intelligent, perhaps to save face, before glancing over the state of my injuries. He spoke with a excited accent. ""Hi, Everybody! We's gonna see what we can do about them ahms."" He peered over at my shoulder sockets and scratched at his fuzzy chin.
""Okay! How would you like to have two arms?"" He asked, pointing his pen into his chin.
""I...yes, I'd like my arms back."" I responded.
""Okay! What about four?""
""Are you a real doctor..?""",0
"""Babe,"" Tyler rubbed her back gently as he stared straight ahead with glassy eyes, ""We've known about this for a year. We're prepared. We've done everything we ever wanted to do. Now it's time to accept our fate."" He spoke almost robotic, emotionless. He was just as frightened as she was, but he didn't let it show. He comforted her, but allowed his eyes to remain fixated in front of him. His hand became motionless on her sweat-soaked t-shirt.
Kate had been crying violently for the past two hours. Her make-up ran like two long black roads down her cheeks and her nose was red. ""I don't want t-to die!"" she exclaimed, mucus dribbling out of her nostrils.
He still didn't blink. The world was ending tonight. A massive solar flare was about to reach the Earth's surface and burn everything up. Including the humans.
""We have so much more life to live!"" she exclaimed once more, still blubbering. She sobbed, gasping for air and wiping the sweat off the back of her knees which she held tightly against her chest. ""I don't want to die,"" she whimpered again.
""Neither do I,"" he snapped, tearing his eyes away from the blurred view in front of him and looking at her. ""We can't stop it, though. So why don't you stop wasting our last few hours crying and make the most of them!""
Her tears stopped immediately and she stared at his with wide eyes. ""I'm sorry,"" her lip quivered.
Tyler's expression softened and he swallowed hard, ""Me too. You know I love you.""
Kate nodded and wiped her nose with the back of her hand, blinking at the ground in front of her. ""I should call my mom to say goodbye."" She choked on the last word.
Tyler glanced at his own phone as she stood up. She tugged at her shorts and walked uneasily out of the room, preparing to make her final phone call. Tyler's phone immediately started buzzing, his own mother calling. He answered. ""Hi, Mom.""
""Baby,"" she responded, her voice more cheerful than he expected, ""Has it happened there yet?""
He furrowed his eyebrows, ""What? The solar flare? Obviously not...""
""No, no. The sunscreen!""
""The what?""
She beamed and he could hear the smile in her voice, ""The sunscreen! I'm glowing!""
He shook his head, his mind becoming frantic and confused, ""Mom, slow down. What are you talking about?""
She inhaled and then exhaled deeply, ""They're calling it sunscreen. Apparently every living organism is equipped with a protective shield that is triggered when a solar flare is impending. Who knew?""
His mouth hung open for a moment as he processed his mother's words. ""That's...ridiculous. Mom, I know you're upset, but it's okay. I love you and this was going to happen at some point in our lives --""
""No,"" she insisted, ""It's all over Mexico. Everything is glowing!""
""That's insane.""
""Honey,"" she continued, ""Scientists are as dumbfounded as you are right now, but it's true. They expect it to spread across the globe within the next hour.""
He glanced down at his arm and noticed a warmth rising out of it that he didn't see before. ""What the...""
""Is it happening?"" she laughed through the phone's speaker.
Just then, Kate bolted into the room, a wide smile on her face and a yellow glow emitting from her skin.
Tyler looked at her, his expression full of amazement. Not removing his eyes from her, he said, ""Yes, Mom. Can you hold on?"" He slowly put the phone down and stood up, approaching his girlfriend. They smiled at each other for a moment and then he picked her up in a tight hug.
She giggled, ""We're going to be okay!""
He laughed joyfully at that, kissing her cheek several times as he set her down. They then proceeded to click on the television to confirm what was happening. Without a doubt, scientists around the world were shown celebrating and explaining the phenomenon.
Two hours later, the world lit up. An hour after that, it lit up again. With fireworks and relief.",0
"I have a recurring dream, you are always in it.
You are more scared than i have ever known you to be. Your mouth is bent and twisted. I would call it a look of dismay, but dismay is a human emotion. Your face is not that of a woman's. Your face is marred with desperate, animal, panic. Your face, is a mask of terror, unshackled from social graces, like a crying infant, a dying dog.
Figures in the background bob and dance.
They whisper. Their voices are deep, their laughter is confusing.
The words send you spinning. The darkness melts away, the sinister void gives way to brick and stone.
The comfort of familiarity is gone. In this place there is no sky. This world is an aberration, it exists between the cracks.
You sit for a awhile and weep. I can feel your sadness. You miss the ones you love.
You run, in an alien world. You see the black slim, sandwiched between two cracked. You see it for a second, but that's all it takes. You blink. The slime is growing through the brick. As a torrent it breaks through the stone walls. It pours in with ferocity and force.
The black slime moves quickly, coating the walls as you run. You are cornered, turning around to come face to face with a wall of the corrosive goo. A single eye opens in its centre, followed by thousands more as tendrils slowly slither towards you. I embrace you with my appendages, sloppy and jagged. I take everything you are. I taste you and remember.
I listen and, sometimes, i can hear.
Forever-we dream our dreams, together.",0
"""What the fuck?"" I said to myself as I held the bag. ""This can't be what I think it is."" I proceed to walk towards my apartment as if it was just another day.
I close the door behind me and check the peep hole to make sure I wasn't followed. ""No time to waste."" As I was walking towards the kitchen to get a bottled water, all I can think about is how awesome it is going to be. I've heard countless stories about these super pills. It was exclusively sold only to people with a lot of money. Lots. With one pill in my hand and the water bottle in the other, I take one breath and popped it in my mouth and downed the whole bottle.
""This feeling"" I said as the euphoria of peace and tranquility along with a sensation of my brain being filled with skills and gifts that can only come from within. ""This must be what it feels like to have money.""
I look at the mirror in my living room and say one of my favorite lines of one of my favorite movies while waving my finger in the air. ""And here. We. Go"" With that being said, I get my bus pass and head out the door of my apartment.
""Oh yeah, this is going to be fun""
It was a great time to begin my new adventure. Ideas were bouncing around in my brain. Left and right. Up and down. ""Ah yes, basic stuff"" I said under my breath. Walking towards the bus stop with a pep in my step, I knew deep down in my heart that this is going to be the last time that I ever have to deal with this shit.",0
"""Assembled ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty members, please refrain from delivering any pointless verbal interactions. Any essential communications shall be emitted only by my computational device."" Dr Mehmed smoothed his snowy white laboratory coat, pristine mustache perched on his upper lip.
Displayed on the interactive whiteboard was various live feeds of the upper atmosphere of planet Earth, transmitted live from an observational satellite developed as part of an ambitious engineering project.
> Predicted intersection of Voyager probe route, Upper Atmosphere Surveillance Net: 1 minute
The crowd of students in the classroom peered intently at the screen, some in interest, most in search for ridiculing material. Sure, Dr Mehmed was...inhumanly smart, the best teacher they'd ever had, but this...this was too far. Maybe his brilliant mind had finally cracked under the pressure of marking incorrect test papers.
One minute later, jaws dropped. A great flash of light had just flitted across the screen, the computer generated recordings played back at a snail's pace. There! A little worse for wear, perhaps caused by so many years of operation, perhaps by the sudden acceleration forced upon it by an unsolicited command signal transmitted to it by a school far far away.
""Visual evidence now confirms it. Did I not inform you, Timothy, that it was quite within my mental capabilities to be able to complete your challenge?"" asked Dr Mehmed, peering at one particularly amazed student in the front row.
""That's well cool sir. We should, like, do truth or dare more often for our form time activity."" came the reply, Tim's eyes bulging.
A vociferous tinkling of broken glass shattered the moment. A swarm of soldiers charged in, weaponry loaded on their black combat dress. Faceless forces, masked by their purple visor clad helmets, circled Dr Mehmed, guns aimed unforgivingly at him. Squawks of radio communication filled the air, the clatter of a hundred pairs of combat boots thundering over the floorboards.
Red dots played across the doctor's chest and forehead, bathing him in unnatural light. Yet more soldiers filed in, each as well armed as the last.
The buzzing of multiple helicopters hovering overhead, the shouts of officers, directing their men into the threat inside the room.
""MEHMED!"" roared the headmaster, charging into the room. ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE‽ """,0
"It was a warm summer day and I was out for a stroll. I saw them on the other side, walking down the sidewalk, two by two. I didn't pay much attention until they passed under the glow of the gaslamp. Never had I seen such an pair of opposites! For the brief time they walked under it, the light illuminated the pair. The man's limbs and head were covered in scars! What I had mistaken for a beard was a mass of scars! His arms and legs were so densely overrun that I had thought it a coat and trousers! The woman had black hair, long and straight, as if it were manufactured string by string. But her skin is what shocked me, even greater than the man! It had the most exquisite complexion, almost translucent in the light, and I saw nary a flaw on it. I looked to my own marred hands, although compared to that man, it was a blessing; as I worried, small cuts formed on my arm. It began to sting as my sweat seeped into my fresh wounds. Not wanting more scars, I shook my negative thoughts and ran to the couple.
""Sir,"" I exclaimed, ""Excuse my frankness sir, but I must inquiry, how is it that your wife is so beautiful, yet you are so….""
The man and woman looked at each other, she turned away, blushing, and he laughed raucously.
""Hideous?"" asked the man between laughs.
""N-n-o,"" I stammered, embarrassed by my rudeness.
""Don't worry,"" he said, putting his arm around my shoulder, ""I get it all the time.""
""My apologies sir, but how, in this world, did your wife manage to keep from scarring?""
""Well, you see,"" he said with a wink, ""she's not my wife, but my daughter.""
I was taken aback. ""Still….How?""
""Well, she's not entirely flawless. She can't tell a joke and her cooking's lousy! Takes after her mother I guess!""
Laughing, he said, ""Take a look at her finger.""
I peered at the daughter, she offered her right hand and I saw a thin bright streak of red on her index finger.
The man pulled me in, ""I'm gonna tell you a story.""
""Long ago, when I was married, I swore never to have kids. I didn't want any children to be born into this world, so that was that. But my wife had other plans, and so my daughter was born. I fell in love with her and swore to devote my life to her. As she grew, though, I began to worry. 'How would I protect her from the world?' So I set out to every doctor, physician, and scientist I could find, asking for a cure. Of course, if there was a cure already, no one would be like this.""
He cleared his throat, took a deep breath, and continued.
""On one particular visit to a doctor, I had my daughter with me and upon exiting the building, I met a man dressed all in black.
I immediately thought, 'This must be the devil' and turned heel back into the building.
'Wait,' the man in black said, 'I can save your daughter.'
I was skeptical and scoffed, 'What for my soul?'
He replied, 'I am bored with just bartering with souls, I am more interested in it's durability.' The devil continued, giggling, 'You see, I do have the power to stop your daughter's scarring, but I'm not a very charitable person.'
'What do you want?' I asked.
'I want you to partake in a very simple wager,' he said, 'Your daughter won't get scars, but *you* will; more specifically, very scar your daughter gets will be transferred to you. If you can manage this wager, you keep your soul, if not, well, you know what will happen.""'
I was dumbstruck that he took the deal, and that he managed to last this long.
""And so,"" the man continued, ""I agreed and the devil pricked mine and my daughters finger to seal the deal. So she grew up and I took the blows. Puberty was a rough time. Children can be so cruel. But that scar on her finger was the last one she'd ever get, I had sure of that.""
I was amazed at this man's love for his daughter and his willpower. How much pain did he have to endure? Every scar on his body seemed to pulsate as I wondered this. I asked, ""Do you ever regret it? Your deal with the devil?""
He replied with a smile, ""Not at all.""",0
"""I was a great adventurer, long ago,"" Mulan said to her grandchildren.
They rolled their eyes and shifted in their seats as her children and nephews and nieces had done before, but that didn't stop her from telling her story. ""I stole my father's armor, and I rode away from my father and straight to the army, where the prince was waiting.""
""Grandma,"" one of the children - what was her name? There were too many to remember them all - asked her with wide eyes. She was a believer, Mulan could tell, a rare quality among her friends and family, even those who knew better, ""Grandma, was Grandpa really a prince?""
""He was,"" Mulan said with a hint of pride, remembering the conquest and how happy she'd been, ""and he is still, though his older brother holds the throne.""
""Could he ever be emperor?""
""No, child, his brother has many sons with sons of their own. The throne will pass to them long before it passes to him.""
""Grandma,"" a boy spoke up, again with a familiar face but no name - drat it all, where had her memory gone? - ""Grandma, what about the dragons?""
""There was only ever one dragon,"" she replied, ""and a great and powerful beast he was. Without his guidance and powers, I never should have made it through the war.""
""Grandma..."" another child asked, but then a bell rang out over the grounds of the temple, and the children scattered away like excited pups, ready for their mother's teat. ""Dinner!"" Mulan heard over the clamor, ""come back and eat!""
A few of the older children stayed behind to help her to her feet. ""Thank you, thank you,"" she said as she hauled herself upward and positioned herself over her cane. ""Run along now."" They scattered as well, leaving her alone with her thoughts and memories, watching as they ran back to families and friends that she made possible with the sweat of her brow and the flesh of her back.
No, I must not think those thoughts, she thought. I am not special to them. Not any more.
There was a time when she was hailed as a hero, a time she remembered. The fire had purified her somehow, and after the Huns had fallen she emerged like a fiery dragon from the embers, ready to lead their great land. But her husband and his brothers weren't ready, and the old ways fell back into place. Soon she was a mother, and then a grandmother, and now she was a memory, an artifact of an earlier time, a relic consigned to the museum of the past, a curiosity worth little more than a passing glance.
""Oh, she told us she fought the Huns,"" they would say. ""Oh, they say she donned her father's armor,"" they chatted. ""But how could that be?""
Sometimes she looked out over the palace grounds, and she could still feel the heat from the flames and taste the soot in her mouth. She felt the weight of the blade in her hands as she danced across the rooftops, nimble and lithe. She remembered how her prince had looked at her as he realized the truth, saw her for what she was instead of what she pretended to be. With a pang of guilt, she longed for those days, and not for the first time.
""Is this what happily ever after feels like?"" she wondered aloud, and then, leaning her weight on her gnarled cane, she stepped out of the temple and downwards, her shoulders weighed down with the past.",0
"(Aussies tend less to stay in dorms so writing in an appropriate way for here!)
I put my breakfast down and went to the door. Who the hell would even be knocking at this time in the morning? I am the only one in my house who wakes up this early, partly because I have class in an hour and partly because I'm 35 weeks pregnant and have been awake since 3am.
I open the door and stop in my tracks. What I see is unexplainable. I don't know how to describe it, except that it's me. I'm starting at me. This woman is different, sure. Her hair is longer and different. She's about 25kg heavier, but looks great. Glowing. Happy.
This woman speaks 5 words to me.
""You need to leave. Now.""
I shut the door as I heard my boyfriend get in the shower.
""Who are you?"" I ask. I fidget nervously figuring out in my head how the hell I'd explain to Nathan why I even answered thedoor, let alone explaining the body double. I stop as I notice her face, my face, contorts to a confused and pained look.
""I'll explain everything soon. While he's in the shower just oak done stuff and come with me. I'm begging you.""
I believe her. Me. God, this is confusing. I run downstairs and start packing and oversized handbag with a few days worth of clothes. I wiggly get dressed in to jeans, a singlet and cardi and rather than spend the usual hour on my face and hair, I put my hair up and make sure my face is clean. I open the bathroom door and say a quick goodbye to Nathan, telling him that my study group called and asked me to come in early.
""Fine, I'll call you at lunch. You don't have money for the bus so you can just walk today."" His usual response.
I waddle back upstairs, slip my flats on and walk out the door. I look at this version of me and we share a look that I can't explain. I don't know if I trust her, but I trust myself so silently we walk to her car.
I notice a booster seat in the back. I close the back door, my nerves are shot. I hop in the front and put my belt on. She starts the car and we drive. We drive for about 30 minutes, North, until she finally says ""You can't go back there.""

"I look in the empty eye sockets under the unraveling black cloak. I can't believe I'm looking death in the face, or lack there of. But he has no interest in me whatsoever. His scythe rises and I hold my little sister a little tighter in my arms. Why had she been so hell bound on climbing that apple tree anyways? The scythe starts coming down and I yell the only thing I could think of. ""Take me instead."" I close my eyes tightly until I notice nothing is happening. I look up and see that death's scythe seems frozen in mid-air.
And that's when he speaks with a deep booming voice. ""I cannot."" As I look confused death takes his scythe back and reaches for my sister with his bones hand.
""Don't touch her."" I scream, wrapping my arms even closer around her. But death ignores me as his bony fingers brush through my sister's hair.
""The request of substitution can only be made once per life. Never before I have met a person so loved that two people would die for her."" There's almost a hint of emotion in his voice.
I look at him confused. ""Two people?""
""You remember your mother?"" Death asks, slowly pulling his hand back.
""She died in a car crash. My sister somehow came out a..."" Slowly my words trail off as I realize what death meant.
""She wasn't supposed to die in that car. She was."" Death points at my sister.
I start crying even harder as I bury my face in my sisters hair, clasping on to her for dear life. Only when I feel a bony hand on my shoulder I look up. I see an actual tear running down death's cheekbone. ""Don't worry, I'll personally take care of her."" And with that he is gone, and I'm left alone, holding the death body of my sister under the apple tree she just wanted to climb.",0
"Bright light wakes me, my clothes are damp from sweat. I think to myself ""how the hell did I get so hot, I never turn the heat on in my apartment and it's only April.""
Reluctant to open my eyes, I lean myself up and sit avoiding the light. I'm dreading today, like most days. I wish I could just sleep, or lay, or something other than moving from where I am. It's so hot I cant stay here in these clothes, I think as I wipe sweat from my forehead. My eyelids slowly open and the red seeps in quickly and powerfully. My heart beat quickens. Where am I? This doesn't look familiar. I thought I was just waking up, from my bed. I've never even been out of my home town, how could I possibly not recognize where I was. Scanning my memory I try to recollect what the last thing I did was. I cannot. Oh, yes I was...my eyes lock on to a casually walking figure in the distance.
Happy to not be alone, and the thought of some explanation briefly gives my racing heart a relief. I stay seated trying to make sense of what's happening. As the man walks closer, I pick myself up panting from the heat and my anxiety.
With his hand outstretched he greets me, ""Hi."" He helps me from my knee to stand the rest of the way up.
""Who are you?"" He asks, in a tone that matched my own disheveled demeanor.
""I...I'm Sean"" I stammer, only half sure. Most of my brain is still reconstructing my new reality. I've never been in such an unfamiliar and uncomfortable place before. ""Where am I?"" I sputter out shortly after my name, with desperation.
""I'm not really sure, I've been here a while on my own. I call it Hell.""
""Wh.. What did you say?""
""I don't know, Hell, that's what I call it."" He said, in a nonchalant tone as if he were embarrassed I didn't like his name for this place.
My mind races as I try to make sense of why I'd be in Hell. I'd never really believed it were real, I'd always pushed off those types of thoughts and set my mind on other topics. Less daunting, I guess I was always curious but figured I'd have time to make sense of it eventually.
My eyes scanned the terrain, flat with blowing dust blocking me from seeing any real distance. Glares of lights behind the clouds moved with the wind, but no sound followed their movement. There wasn't really a Sun, at least I couldn't see it through the rolling dust clouds. In fact, just then my thoughts were quiet enough to notice how eerily silent it was. Moments pass, and the silence is broken by him saying my name.
""Sean..."" He says with his eyes scanning my face, surely wondering what I'm looking at as there's nothing to see.
""Ye.. Yeah I. I'm in Hell? But why? What did I do?"" I asked, defeatedly.
""I was hoping you would tell me. I've been here so long, but I knew others would ever come. I just didn't know when"" He says, grim and calm. It's as if he's not surprised, or happy to have another person here. I just, am.
""Wait, how did you get here. Why have you been here alone so long. How long have you been here. Who put you here? Did you bring me here? Am I dea-"" I blurt out every question racing through my mind as fast as I can so that maybe the answers will calm me down. My brain needs an explanation to understand, to make sense of this. I wasn't a bad person, I don't belong in hell.
He stops me before I can finish throwing all the questions I have at him through my teeth and answers.
""I've always been here."" His naturally sinister tone is more evident now. He continues ""I did nothing to bring you here, you just showed up. You brought yourself here, tell me how you got here.""
I scanned my memory, thinking about ways I could have died. I was dead, right? I had to be if I was in Hell. But I didn't belong in Hell, I never hurt anyone. I never broke the law, or was a bully. I had spent the majority of my life alone, filling my time with things I thought I enjoyed.
There was a long silence while I thought about what he asked. His slow and unwavering tone did not make me feel like I needed to maintain a conversation, it may have only confused me more.
""I thought I was just sleeping."" I said without much thought.
""But now you're here,"" he said.
I took a moment to gather all this information. I was in hell, with one other relatively normal looking guy. He seemed to be calm about this barren soundless place, and walked up to me knowing I wasn't a threat and expecting me or someone to come eventually.
""Are yo.. You're the Devil. Aren't you?"" I say in a half question, half statement sort of tone.
""I must be."" He replies, and I get the sense that he'd never heard the name before, or thought it. But he knew that it was correct.
""Why are you here,"" He reiterates.
""I don't know, I was asleep, and now I'm here. Take me back, can you? Will you send me back?"" I ask with a hint of desperation and confusion.
""Why, are you here."" He says again, pausing briefly.
I begin to walk and he follows, thoughts being pounded into my head. I cant remember ever doing this much contemplation. I always pushed thoughts that burdened my consciousness aside and left them for another time. There was always another time. Now I can't escape.
He walks just behind me, over my shoulder. I imagine as a security officer at a correctional facility would, I could feel him watching me. Never breaking eye contact. Staring at my head as if he could see the wheels turning and me trying to understand what he meant by asking me why I was here. The memories I have from before this are scarce, I remember going to work each day, I remember eating, and sleeping. Falling asleep so many times in the same position, wearing the same clothes. Cycling through the same three outfits each week. I never put much thought to the cyclical repetitive nature of my daily life, it's just...how it was. I never allowed my self to be uncomfortable, and go places that frightened me. I never allowed myself to interfere with anyone else's life.
As I started to uncover more details and lift the fog in my mind, I remembered more subtle aspects of my life. The blank walls of my cubicle, the stark contrast of the low frequency drone the fans made against the high frequency buzz of the fluorescent lights. The thin trails in my apartment's carpet from walking to and from the same two rooms each day. Never had I thought of these things in such vivid detail, I just pushed them away. As more detail flooded in I remembered laying in bed on my last night. I sat down, took off my watch and placed it on my night stand. As I sank back on to my single pillow I looked at the familiar spot in my ceiling. That's the last thing I remember.
We had been walking for some time now, maybe hours. I really had no appreciation for time. The glow never changed, the heat never dissipated, but I grew tired as if the day had been going on. Neither of us said a word, and I only looked back to watch my foot prints disappear in the dust ridden terrain. I couldn't tell how far I walked, or where I was, I could just feel the life escape my body with every drop of sweat. As my mental and physical strength began to dwindle, I stopped. I hadn't looked back in a while, and I've given up thinking, I drop to my knees as the drops of sweat I can muster collect on my forehead.
""You see, now?"" He asked me.
Still perplexed, but slowly realizing I say ""Did I ever really live?""
""Did you?"" His ambiguity and lack of empathy began to frustrate me.
""But I thought that people who went to hell were the ones who murdered, and stole. Who ruined lives."" Still confused, and defeated I limply responded.
""You are the first."" Plainly the words strolled from his mouth.
From my knees I fall forward, and roll on to my back. Looking into the plain red glow, the silent flashes of flames and red dust are the only thing I see. What I assume are the last few drops of water within my body collect in eyes. Not enough to create a drop, but enough for me to know. My tear ducts burn for more, but I have none. I want to cry, I want to feel. There was no tomorrow anymore, there was no putting it off. I guess, this is what I've always wanted.

"A sleepy man - woman? It was hard to tell with all that hair and that lank figure - huddled under blankets, a cup of hot tea in their hands as they stared at the windows. Two windows, on the other side of which was a beautiful world. Full of colors, full of life, full of people.
They found themselves - it found itself? - at a loss for how to describe it. The words from their - its? - lips floundered, fell, stuttered, and eventually fell silent, feeling inadequate. Piles of letters and phrases littered the floor, and it huddled deeper within its confines, burdened by an overwrought sense of divine presence overbearing its creative design.
Behind, on the other side of the seat, a creature with a knife sat, slashing up words that it snatched from the floor. With eyes keen and set on destroying every misplaced syllable, it forgot its true purpose, and the shards and vowels and consonants lay fragile across the floor. A cackle left its lips as it slowly pulled 'floccinoxihiliphilipication' apart, delicious symbol by symbol, before letting each one hit the floor in turn.
The chuckling turned to a mad howling as the blanket suddenly found its way around the little monster, muffling it as the other being rose to its full height and strode to the windows, hands on the windows as it watched the ongoing events outside. Eyes wide, full of wonder, full lines of paper seemed to fall from its mouth in a never-ending stream of fantasy and delight.
The little beast screeched and hooted, desiring so much to silence the other in its room, but could only escape once the words stopped.",0
"Terra was always considered the land of misfits.
The one place in the galaxy where worlds could dump their unnecessary, and unneeded species from their worlds to ours. Each planet of the federation was granted the ability to drop the entirety of one species off onto Terra to free themselves of the burden of their existence on their own world. Terra was considered a *Death World*. As in it couldn't sustain life for long periods of time, due to the general entropy of our solar system, and the fact that earth can only handle so much life at once from packing it full of these *useless* species. The Galactic Federation would cause mass extinction events to ""cleanse"" the planet when it got too packed, essentially a cosmic trashbin for the Galactic Federation.
Humanity really was a luck of the draw. After the last M.E.E. of the Galactic Federation, as we know mammals came to be the dominant type of animal on the planet, eventually giving way to the rise of *Homo Sapiens*. Humans were lucky. One in a trillion, usually the beings of energy who lead the Galactic Federation gift the evolutionary path to sentience, and intelligence to a world, but we were the first who came to be in a natural fashion, quite literally diamond in the rough, the treasure in the world of intergalactic trash.
And now that we were one of them,

"This is what i wrote so far. I didn't realize how long it was until I stopped and read some. If you want me to continue let me know.
I never much had a taste for flying. Almost like a long Cuban cigar which I find harsh and unpleasant yet, some love the taste and ""texture"" of the thick smoke rolling off the tongue. Much like flying in a way, some love flying, or just don't mind it, while others loath the very slightest of plane rides.
I myself always find a nervous pit in my stomach form when it comes to booking the tickets, checking the bags, and boarding the flight. That small sudden ping of anxiety the moment the flight attendant fakes the over exaggerated hello and the captain gives his pre-flight speech to prepare the individuals partaking on the flight and giving them all the particulates. Today was no different as I boarded the flight I got the same pang of anxious, stomach churn and took my seat.
3-B, window seat, I guess I couldn't be upset for I enjoy the flying sensation, staring downward at the miniscule landscape, with that brief understanding of the perspective of god In way, or for those who don't believe in the big omnipotent man upstairs, at least a bird.
3-B, window seat, for some reason my mind wanted to repeat it as if some form of a sequence, maybe I should have had some more damn coffee this morning waiting at the O'Hare lounge. Plus, the barista there was a looker, even though she always seems to get some grounds in your coffee, but nobody is perfect.
Tilting back my tray the flight attendant brought me over the pretzels and prune juice I asked for as I set my travel pillow behind my head. Shoving my Memorex ear phones, connected with my iPod, I nestled in to the ever so fraudulently comfortable airplane seats and drifter away, suddenly envious of the 1st class fliers with their bed-like seat structure.
Dreams, so vivid it felt like they weren't just actual life, but a part of my soul, crashing through my mind as if they were freight trains without the hindrance of brakes. The dreams came in the forms of odd, slow, and jumbled images. The images twisted around as if imitating an owl's head movement were blurring by my vision, Twisted images all indistinguishable yet, all causing a sense of panic, an almost pain like feeling.
Suddenly awake as if in the blink of an eye I reared my head to the left with a slight gasp, Cold sweat grasping my body in waves causing me to shiver uncontrollably, being asleep for only 40 minutes felt like days as I groggily sat forward, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, withdrawing the buds from my ears I withdrew my laptop from my checked bag as if it would send some comfort to myself having that homily item to rely on. Never leaving home without the square centrality of my life holding everything from work, play, and the pictures of my kids all in one place, astounding the advances of technology truly are as I click the power button and wait for the startup blinking followed by the encouraging tune of music that plays upon arriving at the password page.
CNN, my trusted news source for the last 5 years of my journalism career, anywhere from the cold facts to the stony, dumb bastards running this country, however what I saw upon arriving at the home page was numbing, a shock as if the family dog had just been hit by a vehicle. The flight, the damned flight MY ticket has listed on it 357. ""Gone, Disappeared, or severely off course, American Airlines flight 357 goes dark!"" I glance around the aircraft in which all members are still resting as if nothing at all could be the bother. I un-click my seat restraint and move towards the bathroom with a sickly feeling tormenting my stomach as if you just spilled the milk and your step father doesn't like wet shoes. I make my way towards the rest room moving slowly as if in molasses almost to a crawl.....",0
"My parents, like most, had chosen how my first 90 points had been spent. Every year, on my birthday I found out how my parents chose to improve me. Every year it was the same, and now I have 90 points of Empathy. I had even less input than most children, my parents were public figures and couldn't risk it looking bad if I chose Beauty or any of the other vain statistics. They are preachers, and there is nothing more godly than Empathy. But people are not as good as my parents have always believed and so my Empathy is not a blessing. I understand their choice, for how could I not? And I do not blame them, they didn't choose Intelligence for themselves after all, so it is not as if they could have understood this burden. They chose Patience, Love, and Leadership year after year and I can understand why they felt that Empathy would make my heart swell and accept God like theirs have. Yet my Empathy hasn't lessened my natural hatred, or self pity, or selfishness. I may understand how everyone feels, but I am not compassionate and I am not compelled to care.
After my 18th birthday I defied my parents'wish to keep spending my points on Empathy and did the one thing they truly couldn't condone, I spent them on nothing. I have 110 points that I have never used. They see it as me turning my back on the wonders of God and his gift to humankind. And it wasn't even an active rebellion, I simply couldn't see any use to them. Now though I have found a purpose for my life and I know how to use my points to achieve it. I have decided to spend them on Charisma. If I can understand how everyone feels and also have the Charisma to manipulate those feelings, there is nobody who could stop me. And my only goal will be to end the points.",0
"It had been called the silent planet once but now, most days, it screamed.
Not literally of course but stand above a chorus of a billion souls and the noise is more than enough to drown out most anything. It makes for a very noisy and sleepless occupation, one that I am *soooo* honored to have in case any of the higher ups are listening to this.
Earth 1, the prime creation. The first and by far the worst that my father ever created. I never quite understood how a race or people so similar in *every* way could find so many different reasons to hate each other so. I never understood how you could so easily diverge into a million different religions when the truth was spoonfed to you by the King of Kings himself. I never understood how you could pour so much of your resources into finding new ways to kill each other. But I did understand why you were truly his children.
You see his sight is endless but his attention is not. He's ever so obsessed with recreating the Magnum Opus that was Earth, so much so that he created nearly endless different instances of earth's just like your own. He never quite got the formula exactly right another time. So naturally when he left his pursuit of recreation on the back burner of his endless might be turned his attention to you once more.
My outpost is a coveted one, its the most important of all in fact. He trusted it to me, his second son, Michael. And though my post is considered to be an immense honor in the armies of Heaven, its reputation did no proceed it. I have watched over the endless carnage that is your society for millennia, and I expected my father to smite you the instant he turned his titanic attention towards you once more. However, almost as if to show me how little I truly understand him, he looked upon your earth and smiled.
I never asked why but I think I worked it out. It's your spirit that he loves. That he chases after. It is one of creation. It is one of endless love. It is one of endless malice. It is one of endless kindness. It is one of endless hate. It is one of power. It is one of weakness. It is one that is all things. It is his.
The perfect mirror of the perfect being. Forever beyond his reach, to touch it is to destroy it. To gaze upon it is to know the sorrow of the creator. It is why he seeks to recreate it. It is his perfection incarnate. After all you were made in his image.
So when he turned his attention to you once more after all these millennia, all he did was look upon you. His face that is not a face held immense sadness. All he did was look and for an instant I saw in you what he does. I saw him.
So I turned my eyes to the silent planet once more and the sounds that escaped it were no longer screams, but rather calls of joy. As if you knew your perfection, as if you knew just what it is that you were the perfect emulation of. I took to my post once more and I looked not upon the mewling faces of the savages but upon the visage of God himself.",0
"The armored knight raised his broad sword above his head, his equally broad shoulders squared on his target. His right hand clenched like a vice grip on the hilt with his left holding with slightly less force. He understood that this judgment must be the first and last blow, lest he be butchered by his opponent's swift blades.
""This will be your only warning traitor! To your knees or I will strike you down so further below this mud that you may never rise again!"" The sound of his heart beat drained out the rain, worried his words would tremble he had squeezed the hilt even tighter.
""Your hubris will be your end Edward. No matter your strength or your armor you will never strike me nor will the edge of my steel fail to taste your blood!"" Leather was all that covered this soldier's body, weighing him down slightly as it held the rain. His long black hair matted against his face, concealing all the shared traits of the two swordsmen but their sapphire eyes.
Once brothers in arms, these two were far passed reconciliation. Charles was irredeemable in his twin's eyes, his twin short swords had consumed their father's blood. Edward having given up his royal title, swore an oath to guard the King with his life. He had believed he was the better swordsman, and for that he should protect his brothers. It would allow Charles to take the kingdom, and while they may have shared the same eyes, Charles did not share the same sentiments.
Edward's oath kept him beside their father at all times. Even during the war, when the kingdom's two greatest swordsmen were expected to lead the fight. The upcoming battle would have their brethren face an army of over ten thousand slaves. Themselves only half the size, Charles knew that alone he would perish much like his fellow soldiers. Without his brother at his side, Charles' skill in attack would remain uncomplemented and open to retaliation. Charles would become a prize target, with only a small shield in Ethan. Charles is death would leave Edward's oath null, returning his rights as heir.
Before any of this Charles had already shown his dissent. Their father was mad with rage at the foreign army's refusal. The foreign army had shown no desire to take their kingdom, but required passage through their lands to reach the far west. The King, having heard of their coming, sent a minor brigade to refuse them passage without toll and fealty to the King's right of dominion.
The foreign army slaughtered the brigade, having interpreted the group of knights as a threat. They would send their own messengers to the King, carrying the heads of his knights. The foreign army would not acknowledge the King, but granted him mercy. They would pass through without disruption, as long as the messengers returned to them by the following nightfall. If they did not return, the foreign army was prepared to annihilate the King and his people.
Edward kept his opinions to himself, while Charles expressed distaste in his father's choice to send the brigade in the first place. He warned his father that it would only end in trouble, and to allow the foreign army passage without interruption. Aware of the foreign army's capabilities, as heard through the various rumors, Charles knew lives would be saved if they avoided a confrontation. Nevertheless, the King's arrogance would not allow the foreign army to waltz through his domain without a showing of subservience.
Their father was mad, ignorant, and cared naught for the people in these final years. When their father called for the messengers heads Charles protested while Edward quietly observed. The messengers did not plead for their lives, but merely said, ""The Prince is wise. His actions will save the lives of your people. Yours would erase your existence from history. No *true* King fails to grace the pages of history."" Moments later the King would have Ethan take their heads and add them to the pile they brought.
Soon thereafter, Edward took his oath and relinquished his title without any consultation. Charles could not fathom his actions. The King had planned to send nearly their entire army to their deaths, including his sons, and his brother would abandon him like a coward. Charles' disgust with Edward would soon turn to hatred.
Whispers claimed that Edward had sent the lieutenant from his personal guard to the foreigners. He would carry an offer of fealty to the foreign Emperor, once they had massacred his brothers and remaining soldiers, in return for sparing the remaining Kingdom under his own name. The whispers came from the torture of Edward's lieutenant, after Ethan captured him while the kingdom's army made their way towards the foreign army.
Charles, having learned of this betrayal, would leave Ethan in charge and return to court. ""Father's madness infects Edward's blood,"" Charles believed. ""I cannot allow this to carry on any further,"" he resolved. Charles would seek to have his father relinquish the crown and thus allow him to attempt peace with the foreign Emperor.
Upon returning to the throne Charles was met by his father, seated and drowning himself with wine, with his brother at his side broad sword in hand planted downward into the marble dais. ""You send your people to death! Your sons to their graves, while you feed your madness with wine!?"" Charles refused to hold his tongue any longer, the court quieted and the air was suddenly thick with tension. The King looked crookedly at his enraged offspring. Charles continued, ""And you! You conspire against me!? If you wished for the throne all you need was ask! We could have spared innocent lives if you simply spoke with me! We could have avoided needless bloodshed if you could overcome your cowardice!"" His anger with his brother was beyond that with his father, but his bond with his twin was of a different magnitude. Edward remained quiet, tightening his grip on the hilt of his broad sword, his armor shifting slightly.
""You, you dare..."" the King began but paused. ""...You are a seed not worthy of my words, but I am a merciful King...However I will not poison the hearts of the people with our discourse. Empty the court! I will have words with my son that no one need witness."" Momentarily Charles' tension left him, believing he had a chance to break through to his father while the court emptied. The King looked to Edward, ""you as well my boy, I have no desire to embarrass your brother any further."" Edward protested, but the King's sapphire eyes turned cold on him, and he made his way out.
Once the court was empty, Charles took a few steps towards the throne, ""Father.. I'm sorry for my anger but --""
""Sorry!? How dare you speak before me! How dare you call me 'Father'! I am your King child! You will refer to me as such and nothing else!"" The King stood, looking down towards his son, incensed with hatred.
Charles made another attempt, ""...Your highness, I plead tha --""
""You PLEAD!? I did not empty this court for you to plead! Silence your tongue before I rip your throat from its godforsaken shell!""
Charles' anger began to boil once again, realizing his father was beyond reason. He remained silent.
""You are a son of mine no longer. Your rights are removed, and with Edward's oath Ethan will be well protected. You will return to the vanguard and give your life for your King! If your bones do not come back in pieces I will break them MYSELF before EVER laying my dirt atop you!"" The King was far gone. There was no repair for this sort, Charles knew.",0
"Human diversity so so huge, nothing can really encompass it, not religion or science or magic. There are always exceptions, always things you have not considered, things that just don't fit.
A masochist probably should not do onto others as he would like others to do unto him, and neither should a judge. Killing isn't always immoral, and saving a life is not always moral, especially in the case of a certain failed German painter.
Electrons don't *really* orbit the center of an atom. Light isn't *really* a wave, except when it is.
Similarly the English language has its own limitations. Some figures of speech just can't describe certain realities.
When I was dying wasn't when I was ""scared to death"". In fact I had never felt so alive.

"Safirameal chuckeld to himself. Finally someone had fallen for his act! Tobias-14 was as gullible and naive as a demon could wish for.

Tobias-14: I've never done it before...

Tobias-14: I am cool. Fine. let's do it.

Truth was, though, I never really tried anything before really. I never was interested in art or music, and never had any athleticism either. I wasn't any good at juggling, I was an OK cook at best, and really couldn't hum, let alone sing.

""Yeah, my last performance review!"" someone shouted from the back, followed by a smattering of laughter. Oh, what a riot we were.
""OK, there's a trash can; thanks Cindy. All right, everyone watch, here we go,"" I said as I pushed the trash away. ""Yeah, not very impressive, I know,"" I mumbled to silence. And more silence. Finally, it got uncomfortable. ""What? You wanted me to participate; I never said it was a *good* talent, OK?""
""How did you do that,"" whispered Jeff, our VP of operations. ""What did you do?""
""What? I just, you know, pushed it away.""
""Away? Away from what?!""
""You know; away from everything.""
""What, like, everything? All at once?""

"The secret congregation sits in tense silence. The wood paneling of the underground facility's room seems to simultaneously absorb and amplify all sound. There are seven chairs, one empty and six occupied. One delegate for each populated continent.
Liu Jieyi, Asia. A no nonsense, balding Chinese man who stares at Gary Quinlan of Australia's nervously rapping knuckles with vague annoyance.
Vitaly Churkin, Europe. The typically stoic Russian stares at the wall with all the intensity he can muster. Jeremiah Mamabolo of Africa whispers in hushed tones to Samantha Power of North America, who nods along with a serious expression. Antonio Patriota of South America busies himself with some important-looking documents.
The double doors burst open and everyone jumps just a little, Churkin included. Six intimidating men in suits escort two inhumanly tall figures. Eight feet tall at the very least. That was their least striking feature, however.
The Atlantean delegate takes the seventh seat at the head of the table. Her guardian stands protectively and discreetly behind her. Water can be heard quietly rushing within the large breathing apparatuses covering both their necks and mouths. The regal princess looks around the table, blinking expectantly with her inner vertical eyelids, and then with her outer lids. Her hands are crossed peacefully before her, the cobalt blue hue of her skin striking an impressive contrast with the mahogany of the table.
Mrs. Power clears her throat uncomfortably. ""Princess Neni wishes to convey another message from her people. Let's proceed.""
One of the suited men procures a keyboard and places it before the Atlantean. The human delegates look expectantly at a screen behind her. Neni types fluidly, despite the inconvenience of her webbed fingers.
`Your people have not taken the actions we warned you must take. This is clear to the Atlantean people.`
Mamabolo huffs a little at this. Quinlan decides to choose his words carefully. ""With all due respect, your highness, your empire within the ocean is vast, and it's difficult to clean up hundreds of years of waste spanning so great a distance in such a short time period. When my countrymen discovered your stronghold in the Barrier Reef four years ago, you promised patience.""
`Soon, matters of patience will not be up to us.`
""Stop these infernal veiled threats,"" Liu retorts, ""you keep warning us of this other entity. If your people are so technologically advanced, why do you seem to cower in fear of this one you speak of so vaguely?""
Neni's large eyes narrow.
`I have told you before, we do not speak of the Old One.`
Churkin pipes up at this. ""And why ever not? Why not just do away with this menace you so frequently mention?""
Patriota has been silent throughout. He breaks the frosty silence that Neni offers in response to Churkin's demand.
""They can't do away with their own kind."" Neni looks at the South American representative with mild surprise. He is taken back by her reaction himself, taking it as a confirmation of his long-held suspicions.
Liu is outraged. ""So! After all this time, this great destroyer is one of your own? You've always said your people fear it, made us think that cleaning the oceans was imperative to not angering it. But instead of the arch-nemesis you've made it out to be, you actually conspire with it!""
Neni shakes her head furiously at the Chinese man. Patriota is still reeling. When he speaks, his voice shakes somewhat. ""Can it really be? The Yacumama?""
Neni looks at him, and after a long pause, nods slowly.
`This man's people call it the Yacumama. She is the Old One. She is the mother of all my people. And she is angry.`
The delegates all look to one another. Four years of diplomacy, and after all that time it turns out that the great threat is one of theirs. Neni types quickly to add to her previous statement.
`I believe your people in the West know our mother as ‘ Cthulhu ’. And she grows impatient. Her warnings to your people are clear.`
With this, Neni pulls up a file. It's a smattering of news stories from earlier this year. The delegates look on in horror as they realize the truth, as the pieces fall together. The headlines blare across the screen.
`MALAYSIAN AIRLINES DISAPPEARS MYSTERIOUSLY OVER OCEAN. TRANSASIA 222 TAKEN DOWN BY TYPHOON. ALL ABOARD AIR ALGERIE 5017 LOST IN STORM.`
Princess Neni then types five ominous words, and promptly gets up to leave. Her protective companion stares down the room of horrified delegates before also making his exit. The Atlantean delegate's final words flash ominously from the screen.
`The Old One grows restless.`",0
"""Well, what about...eggs?"" You suggested with a wince. You were still as averse to the idea of eating them as you had been just this morning, but your...circumstances...had changed quite a bit since then. And, well. After having every suggestion of vegetable protein denied--including soybeans, which you *hated*--you were getting desperate. Desperate, and very, very *thirsty. * ""I mean, egg albumin is nearly chemically identical to --"" An exasperated sigh bit through your monologue, bringing about its' premature end.
""Look. Okay. *Listen* to me,"" Erzabet pinched the bridge of her nose with spidery fingers, her faint Eastern European accent thickening in tandem with her frustration. ""How many ways do you want to hear it from me?"" She plead. ""The actual, *content*, of what we must consume, is only part of the equation."" She spread her hands wide, palms up. ""Else why would we bother, with all these modern conveniences--when we could simply stock a fridge with donated blood--why still would we go to the hassle of direct feeding?"" You shrugged weakly.
""Fresh...tastes...better?"" Well, it was true for produce. Unfortunately, you imagined sourcing local O-Positive was a lot more difficult than organic kale. The ancient, supernatural, otherworldly woman--currently slouched beside you in a pair of your old sweats and an oversized Spinal Tap T-shirt--grinned ferally, her just-a-bit-too-sharp teeth barely pressing against her lips.
""Oh, don't get me wrong--fresh tastes much, *much* better,"" she rumbled, and, fuck, you could feel your body reacting to that in a way that had *gotten you into this mess in the first place, keep your pants on damn it*. Then she sighed, expression shifting from seductive to tired so quickly you wondered if you hadn't just imagined it. Shit, did vampires actually have some sort of hypnosis?
""But no. You see, while we *do* need the actual substance of the blood to replenish our bodies,"" she began, running her fingers over her cheek, newly flushed with stolen blood--*your* blood, ""it is the actual *act* of taking liquid life from another being that refreshes the magic of our existence: the spell that maintains our immortal forms,"" she explained. You stared at her.
""Uh. Magic?"" She merely raised a single eyebrow to your incredulous expression, and, okay, yeah, you deserved that. You had pretty clearly wandered past science fiction some time ago and had wound up in that embarrassing part of the bookstore that was halfway between bodice-ripper and YA Fantasy.
""Right. Magic."" You paused. Something had just occurred to you. ""So how does the sex factor in?"" You blurted. She snickered.
""Was that not also 'magic'?"" she asked. You rolled your eyes, but couldn't help the embarrassed flush you felt crawling up your neck.
You wondered how long you'd be able to blush, now, before you needed to...refill the tank, so to speak. As if sensing your shift in mood, Erzabet also sobered a little.
""It is...an exchange,"" she said softly. ""Another type of life-ritual. We take the blood, the life-force, to sustain ourselves, and in return, we offer sex, pleasure. Sex is an act of creation, potential life, and rejuvenation of the soul: so when one is traded for the other, neither loses, yet both gain.""
TBC...?",0
"""Kiii-ya!""
""Put it away, darlin',"" I said, exasperated.
I heard another of the blighters drop down from the roof behind me. Damn. Now I was surrounded.
""Look,"" I said, showing my empty palms to the world, ""I come in peace. Watashi wa, heiwa ni kimasu.""
""Anata wa itan-sha, joseidesu,"" one of them spat out. My japanese was a little rusty, but I got the gist. To reinforce the point, a shuriken whizzed past my ear and severed a few strands of hair. Time slowed down as they floated lazily in the air.
The first hair hit the ground and everything happened at once. I mean that literally.
I hit the ""Slow time"" button on the TimeWatch as the first ninja lunged. His movement slowed to a crawl.
More shurikens were drifiting through space towards the spot where I had been standing. I blew a puff of air at one, and sent it spinning.
Then I slipped Brass Betty over my knuckles and smiled at the ninjas.
""OK boys, it's playtime.""

"The tension in the room was incredible.
You could taste it.
You could feel it bend under the intent gaze of hundreds of reporters.
It was terrifying for all of us. Thousands of factories had opened up in the past few weeks under the scrutiny of the tentative alliance between the new visitors and our new unified government.
The trade agreement had done a lot for us here on Earth. We are in a position where there is not war, people are people and money is everybody's. We have reached a level where matters between us don't matter.
Money brings us all together for once.
Back to the tension, see, even I'm trying to cut it.
A single briefcase full of 5,000,000,000,000 galactic credits. Enough to push us toward standing beside some of the greatest civilizations this universe harbors.
For what you ask? A contract.
Those factories are for us.
See, we are the only race in a million planets with opposable thumbs.
And they really like My Little Pony dolls.
Deal made.
So many pictures.
Our future first documented.

"I had waited for this day for what seemed like an eternity. My torment was finally at an end.
I had come from a place beyond time and space itself - before the singularity, before the expansion, before it all. A remnant of some past existence, some old universe where atom charges might have been inverted, or none-existent. It did not matter, for I was beyond that place, as well. I arrived here approximately 13 Billion years ago, when the rules were not rigid and the barriers easily broken. I drifted, for a while. Through the hot, dense clouds of gas that made up the universe I explored, observing the rules that make up the sum of all existence settle into place. I broke every single one of those laws, because I was outside of those laws. I was some unknowable entity, something that existed, but that was all that one would be able to use to describe me.
Time passed. A new phenomenon in itself, and one I took pleasure in experimenting with. Time was wonderful, the idea was novel. The clouds expanded outwards at a steady pace, always forward, and never stopping. After a few billion years, I found a small, barely-solid rock drifting aimlessly around the sun, and I waited. I watched and felt the rock solidify over time, the gasses in it's atmosphere condensing into clouds, flooding the planet with water. I was there from the beginning, when the landmasses split and shifted, great plates beneath the earth moving at an incredibly slow pace - but moving nonetheless.
When I first encountered life, I was overjoyed. Seemingly spontaneous, where had it come from? How did it work? I studied it eagerly, all it's own little rules. The single-celled bodies became multi-celled, then fish, then amphibians. I could not have been happier. Or so I thought.
Then they came. The first humans - simple creatures, like those that came before. I was happy to observe them and figure them out, how they worked, fed, interacted with each other. They barely noticed me at first, some small fragment of me travelling amongst the skies of their little rock. The other animals did not react to me - but these ones did, eventually. They learned to look up. Their initial reaction was one of fear - understandable. I was more than alien to them. It shocked me to see them run away, screaming in some primitive tongue. What shocked me more was when I came back days later to see a carefully arranged pile of stones in the shape of that shard of me where I had been seen. Fruit and meats were carefully arranged underneath it, and a human was on his knees, hands upturned towards the sky - towards me. He saw me again, and was excited. He picked up a bowl of fruit and offered it towards me, eagerly.I took it, and disappeared. I did not know what to make of this - I needed to think. If I could describe what I felt with a human analogue, it would be...powerful.
I watched these creatures grow and change - their primitive tongues turned elaborate and sophisticated. They learned to bend their world to their will - their spark, their drive to succeed and conquer their surroundings impressed me. The lizards and the fish were content to survive, but these humans - they must thrive. I tried to continue to merely observe, but it was fruitless - that draw of power was too much. They had many names for me during my interactions with them - Odin, Anansi, Hephaestus. They contributed their success to my interactions, to my aid. It felt good to accept their praise, but it felt hollow - I tried to express to them in various forms how they were responsible for their growth, but they would not accept it. My interactions with them grew hollow, tiring. They began to grow weary as a species, blaming me for things from plate tectonics to pestilences and diseases. Just as easily as they had praised me for something I had not done, they had condemned me. Wars were fought over which of my fragments had interacted with who, and in what way. Relics claimed to have been passed down by me were found, lost, then found again. I grew tired of it, and I felt pity for them. Their spark was too bright - they ached for something more, and saw it in me. I was just an observer from outside of what they could understand - though to them, there was no difference. I was more than them, and I was beyond them. So I waited.
The day came when their eyes were closed - I chose to wait for a reason. My presence for these creatures was too much - too much misery, suffering, all in my name. To see me in full would doom them. I left silently, and without much event, turning back as I drifted amongst the cosmos to observe their pale blue dot one last time. I wished I could do more for them, but now they were truly on their own.",0
"Once upon a time, there was a guy who was browsing reddit and was a particularly good writer. When he saw a prompt on r/WritingPrompts he was reminded of his addiction to writing, so he decided to click on it and explore a couple of prompts before putting his laptop away. When he went down far enough, he saw an OP who had a particularly vague prompt with a sob story. But with a moment of compassion in his heart, our hero decided to click on it and write this guy a story. Anyway, now I will detail on what will happen in the future. OP will read this story and be enlightened on how amazing it is, and then realize that it is not a happy ending. So then the guy who is writing it will say, ""Well I don't wanna be a cunt and rip this guy off. So I'll write him a happy ending."" Determined to make OP's supposedly bad day better, the guy turned around to grab his drink, and found a man standing there instead. He had a sign that read, 'Good men know the cost of their mistakes, but great men get over their mistakes.' Having seen this, the guy said, ""Thanks bro, you just gave me an idea."" And being given that wonderful quote, he decided to put in his story. And in case you didn't catch the meaning, the happy ending is you receiving the ability to get of your mistakes. The End.",0
"""Hey!"" I shouted. ""I'm not insane, you can't keep me in here!""
The door resisted my attempts to knock it over. My thin coat proudly proclaimed 'Pizza World!' across my back. It was new, I had only had the job a few months. Just enough to make a little money to go to a community college. It itched, and I had always hated it, but it was money.
I had been a week away from moving to a college town, to finally get my degree. And then this idiot thought I was one of his flock to coral, a loony to rot in a loony bin. I never should have taken this job.
A worn voice coughed a laugh next to me.
""Heh,"" the voice croaked, ""This again huh? Alright. I can do this one last time.""
""Hey!"" I said. It was hard to contain the hope from bursting out from my chest. Another person! And he sounded sane! He must be a staff member, I thought. He can fix this all up. He can explain this, and get me out!
""I think there's been a mixup, can you get me out of here?"" I asked hopefully.
""I didn't tell my girlfriend where I would be going, thought it was just another quick pizza run. Get me out of here, will ya?""
There was a pause.
""There ain't no mixups in the Dragon's Den sonny,"" the voice said finally. Regret was thick in his voice. It was a voice of an old, broken man. Full of dust and spiders, choking on dreams long lost. I hoped I would never have to seen the owner of such a voice, such a creature must surely be broken and lost. Maybe he wasn't my solution after all. Hope began to drain out of me.
""What...what do you mean? Isn't this the cities Insane Asylum? This place is supposed to help people."" I said. I was claustrophobic, and the minuscule cell seemed to be growing smaller by the minute. I had to get out.
""You're new here, so I'll try to get you to know what you expect. That way you don't have to learn for yourself,"" the voice said.
""My names Hill. Been here a long time, I have."" The voice stopped, seemingly lost in recollection. I waited desperately for him to continue, to say something, anything. The cell was so small now.
""He tries to keep us separated. The man in the lab coat. But I've been here for a very long time. Long enough to forget the smell of fresh cut grass. Long enough that a sunrise is now a fantasy, and not a reality."" the voice paused.
""The sun does not rise in the Dragon's Den,"" he finally said.
""And that's a funny name for an insane asylum, isn't it? I thought so too at first. It didn't rightly make much sense to me until I had sat in this dirty closet for a few years, and then I got it. The Dragon's Den."" the voice sobbed a laugh. The dim hallways echoed the sob, bouncing off the cold, dirty concrete walls. And echo made the sob sound more like a scream, until it finally drifted off.
""We were his golden horde, you see, and he would defend us at all costs. And dragons loved secrets more than gold. You know what that secret that he defends so fiercely? I bet you're starting to guess,"" the voice asked. It wasn't a question.
I was. Dread spread like black ice down my veins. My heart quickened it's frantic pulse, almost like it had a voice of its own. No. No. No. No. No.
""We weren't insane. None of us were."" the voice affirmed.
""The cell next to me used to have a man named Franklin James. He was a construction worker. The *Man* had collected him after paying for a renovation in one of the blocs. Threw him in one of these cells. He passed away a decade ago, did Franklin. Was never as tough as the walls he built. I should know, I heard him trying to dig through them every night."" The voice choked out another laugh.
""Next to him was a woman by the name of Sarah Smith. She used to make pastries. Muffins. Croissants. Soft, fluffy things full of flavor. Can't say there's much left in the Den that is soft anymore. Those get weeded out fairly quickly, like Sarah did. She didn't last half a year through the electric shocks the Man so loved to give, to correct our *madness*. Our madness. Right.""
""I've been here a long time, and the funny thing is, so have you."" The voice paused.
""We've had this discussion many times by now. Always the same, when you woke up. Always the disbelief. The exact same as the first day we talked. The first day you made me up to hide from the shocks. From the torture. The day you made up an older man by the name of Hill, a man who missed fresh grass and sunshine. A man who could live through the pain and take the misery for you.""
Nothing moved. Silence settled over the small cell like the soft cloak of death.
""Well, I'm tired."" the voice said. My voice. It had always been my voice. My jaws ached from speaking. Why was I still speaking?
""It's your turn now,"" the voice said. ""Maybe now I'll get to retreat inside of you, into a place without the darkness and the pain. Maybe now you'll get to take fifteen years of abuse with barely a soul to talk to. Or maybe you'll make someone new. You're good at that. In any case, it doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm done. ""
""Give the Man in the Coat my regards, sonny."" the voice-I- said.
The voice retreated, leaving me alone in the padded cell. I frantically looked at my clothes. A few tattered scraps were all that was left of my old coat. The patch read ""Iza rld!"" held on by a few determined tatters. In the corner were a few scraps of cardboard and blanket. This couldn't be real. This couldn't be happening.
The metal grate on the thick door shrieked open. The only thing I could see on the other side was a mouth full of broken, yellow teeth surrounded by cracked, wrinkled lips. A mouth befitting a demon. I could almost see the smoke wisp out of those lips as a long longue lashed over those teeth, anticipating the moment.
""Hello, Franklin Hill."" The Man croaked.
""Ready for today's treatment?""
I started screaming.",0

"It's frustrating to only have one of something.
It can be anything; a toy, a trophy, a marketable skill. When you've got one tool, you learn to solve every problem with it. For my village, that *one thing* was coal. We mined it, we sold it, we carved it into jewelry. We bought what we could not make with coins caked in black dust. I can recall even now the days that father brought me to the market with him. I remember one merchant in particular, his eyebrow raised in disdain as our hard-earned money stained his silk gloves. He was too good for us, but not too good for our money. But we are our money. We are our trade. My people have eaten and breathed coal dust for generations. The road to and from the mines is paved in onyx footprints.
Well, it was.
There was a collapse, and now there is no coal. There is no tool through which we may earn respect, no resource we have to offer the world. That is why I am here. I did not grow up with black lungs and bent back. I am young, and though I am hungry, I am strong. I was honored to be chosen, I suppose.
I cannot help but wonder, as I walk through this valley with torch in hand, if this is a fool's errand. No one has prayed or made an offering in Death's Holler in an unrecorded number of years. I raise the flame higher to observe the barren walls around me once again. There is nothing at eye level. The valley's namesake instead lies hundreds of feet above me. Skeletons the size of giants have been carved directly into the walls. I cannot tell if their empty eye sockets hold hope or resentment. They do the job of imposition well and I begin to feel unease at the thought that I am the first in decades to visit with serious intent. I reassure myself with the thought that a forgotten god is a desperate one. How vengeful could they afford to be?
Hours pass before I reach the end. The stone cadavers do not end, but not all of them look down in disapproval. Many are carves so as to be looking off into the distance, or with head bowed in prayer. Even if they are nothing more than statues, I am glad that their gaze is directed elsewhere. My own eyes are focused on the clearing before me.
The path ends in something of a cave. Unlike the path preceding it, long burnt-out torches line the walls. It is wider here, enough for a ceremony and a crowd of onlookers, although I see no benches or chairs. What fills the space instead is an alter, and some distance back, a stone chair, elevated much like a throne. Slumped in the ""throne"" is a skeleton, but a real one. The bones visible from underneath its robes are dusty and yellow. The fingers look as though they might to the ground, were they not clasped tightly around the edge of the throne's armrests. I walk over to the corpse to get a closer look.
I recognize its attire from Grandmother's books. She used to read me the stories of our people before we discovered the mines. She would tell me stories of my ancestors the death worshipers, and the ritual sacrifices they would make. Then Father would wheeze from the other room that *he* was the one making sacrifices now. I smile at the thought until I remember the rest. Grandmother used to say that when times were hard, and no lives could be spared, people would offer their own life in exchange for the gods' help. *Even a drop of blood will do...*
My eyes are drawn once again to the altar. It too is stone, any decoration long since rotted or worn away. The surface however, is indented like a bowl. The room takes on a more sinister feeling now. I can almost see smoke wafting from the torches on the wall. The skeletal priest looks as though he could leap from his seat at any moment. I look again at the altar. It feels almost...expectant.
""Fine!"" I say, if only to hear my own voice.
I can spare a drop or two. I draw my knife from my belt and hold the blade to my wrist. My arms hover above the stone table, the sharp metal cold against my skin. I drag the edge quickly and lightly across my arm before rolling my eyes at how foolish I must look. Only a faint indentation appears, but I feel a slight burning sensation. I use my fingers to stretch the meager wound open until a line of red appears. I squeeze until I think there is enough. I turn my arm over, waiting nervously. I shake my arm as the bead forms, and eventually I am successful. A single red drop lands silently in the basin. I stare at it, the maroon liquid barely visible in the low lighting. I let out the breath I didn't realize I was holding and shake my head at my own foolishness. I stare at my arm, wondering if we are truly so desperate, only to have my thoughts interrupted by the hairs on the back of my neck. My attention turns to the skeleton on the throne. It hasn't moved, but I suddenly feel uneasy at the thought of not having it in my sight. Then, a voice appears in my head, this time not my own.
*My boy, I'm going to need more than that. *",0
"It was just another day for Joseph Pimm. He shook himself out of bed, started the shower and grabbed a cup of coffee from the carafe he set the night before. He lingered for a moment in his kitchen intent on the sound of the shower like falling rain. Joseph began to wave his hand around, as if to sign his name in the air, or to conduct a particularly lazy orchestra. Something was manifesting inside of his head, but he didn't quite know what.
He looked into the carafe. Coffee. He looked underneath it, and behind it. He opened jars, and cupboard doors. The frantic search ruined his immaculate kitchen, which he prided himself in maintaining. What was he even looking for? Did he know himself? ""I'm looking for you!"" he cried out to no one in particular. ""No one? I'm talking to you!"" he said.
Amy returned home from work to her empty apartment. It was a portrait of how she left it earlier that day. She lived alone; a fact that caused her much distress. Her brow furrowed as she looked around. No one to take care of. No one to take care of her. Her eyebrows leaped with a singular thought she said aloud, ""This is what Joe was talking about at lunch today. Some asshole is writing about me now."" She was only partially correct. The narrator is most certainly not an asshole. Her eyes turned towards the ceiling, ""Yeah he is. I'm pretty sure making up stories about strangers is asshole behavior."" Fine. I'll illustrate someone who appreciates it.
This is the story of a dog who was playing with a ball and then started barking wildly at something. Barking as if a stranger were present, but there is none. There's nothing to be worried about dog. Please, resume your carefree and whimsical nature. But the dog continued to bark.",0
"They met on a club, she wasn't supposed to be there.
He asked her to dance, and after much hesitation she agreed.
They had common friends, so they would see each other often.
She was taken, and could only see him as a friend.
Years passed and they continued talking, him waiting for her to realize they were meant to be together.
""I see us growing old together, complaining about the world and how it changes, side by side, in old wooden rocking chairs,"" he joked.
He warned her he couldn't wait forever.
When she finally realized it, he had found someone else.
Both being so faithful, they only dared to speak but once more.
""I guess I'll see you later on then,"" he said.
""In our old, wooden, rocking chairs,"" she whispered as she left.",0
"I sat in the small, uncomfortable plane. The erratic beating of my heart was no less peaceful than the turbulent winds outside. Desperate times called for desperate measures.
The modern weapons of war were tactical and humanitarian in nature. A half-century old rifle was brutally effective, clunky and inhumane. All militaries were required to keep their firearms current to within ten years to avoid unnecessary suffering. Modern guns, bombs and planes, like the one I was in had their advantages not in power but in range, reliability and stealth.
The soft blinking of the light told me to prepare. That was a farce; I didn't need to prepare. There wasn't a parachute to drop me. That would just make me easier to hit on the way down. The only other man noticed it as well and with a face no less grim than my own began popping open the airtight box. Very carefully, with both hands, he gave me a simple piece of wood with a rock tied to the end.
""You're going to bomb them back to the stone age, Soldier.""
All I had to do was hit the ground.",0
"""Someone will find out about this..."" the scientist gasped as he tried to crawl away, painting the floor with his blood.
John could only smirk as he walked slowly after the old man, a bloodied pen knife in his hand. ""Oh, I doubt they will. It has been what...three years? And people are still trying to figure it out.""
The scientist somehow managed to reach his desk, and his hand went for the phone.
""Oh no you don't,"" John said, before plunging the knife into the scientist's hands. He howled in agony.
""Such a pity that your trait is not **Strength**, or else you would have fought me off by now,"" John teased the man, slumped weakly against his desk. The white carpet beneath him was fast turning red from his blood.
Seeing that the scientist could no longer move, John quickly scoured his office, picking up files that detailed the danger of the approaching asteroid and throwing them in the middle of the room.
""Why?"" John heard a weak voice coming from the table. ""Why are you doing this?""
John chuckled at the question. Almost all of his victims in the past three years asked him that, as they all laid dying before him. No harm indulging the dying scientist his last question.
""Simple,"" John said, as he continued to move across the room. ""It's fun to watch.""
""But people will die!"" the scientist croaked. ""Everyone has been wondering why our traits have gone on prime for three years now.""
""Yeah, I know,"" John shrugged, throwing more files into the growing pile. He thought of the growing confusion in the public bemusedly, of how everyone is wondering why their traits have gone on prime, signalling an imminent danger, for three years now. ""And thanks to me, they will never know why until it's too late.""
""You're a monster.""
""No, I'm not,"" Join replied, his eyes staring at the flame before him.
""I just have a very high **Anarchy** trait,"" John continued, before tossing the lighter towards the files.

"They stood there waiting in anticipation. Well, one of them was.
""I shouldn't be in Hell! Surely this is wrong! God damn this place"" said the 'bad' man
""Well that was a mistake""
""Easier for you to say, you're going to Heaven for nothing""
""Actually I donated 95% of my salary to charity which helped millions""
""Oh. That's probably why I'm going to Hell. I guess only the rich go to Heaven"" The other man pondered this.
At that moment a black portal opened and sucked him into Hell before the 'good' man could retort. He turned to the other one who hadn't spoke yet.
""So where are you going?""
""I'm neither coming and going"" The 'good' man was flabbergasted ""How do you mean? You must go somewhere. Heaven or Hell?""
""But I'm not a Christian.""
""Ah. Strange you're here then""
""Yep""
A golden elevator came down and the 'good' man stepped on it without saying goodbye. The last man was alone.
""Now what?"" He thought to himself. Forever.",0
"SLAM! The ringing steel doors echoed through the the hangar as Major Harvey Johnson marched smartly across the empty space. The cyber Intel team had been taken by surprise, as no inspection was scheduled for today. They all stood nervously as attention. A man with more stripes on his arms than the rest moved to intercept the major.
""Major Johnson, sir!"" He saluted with as much enthusiasm as he could muster.
""Sergeant Taylor, is it? Well, sergeant..."" The major paused as he surveyed the cyber warfare unit standing at attention around their stations. ""Put your men at ease.""
""Platoon, Parade REST!"" Taylor turned back around to address Major Johnson. ""Sir, I don't believe we were notified of an inspection today. What can I do for you?""
Johnson moved in close to Taylor's face; so close, in fact, that the sergeant could feel the brim of Johnson's cover touching his forehead.
""Sergeant, you have a mole. I am here to coordinate the shut down of your entire unit and erase the servers stored here. Your team has 2 hours to comply.""
""With all due respect, sir, 2 hours doesn't even give me enough time to verify these orders from SECDEF. If you will allow me to do my due diligence, I can have this unit RFT by end of business today."" The sergeant steeled his gaze on the major, willing him to back down. Suddenly, the major took a step back, and pulled out his cell phone. He dialed a number, and handed the phone to Taylor. ""It's for you."" Taylor raised the phone to his ear.
""Master Sergeant Taylor, this is Secretary Jass. I need your unit shut down by the end of the day. Everything erased. Nothing, and I mean nothing left. Because of the possibility of a mole, you must personally inspect each of your airmen for any information they may be attempting to steal. Can you get this done, or do I need to send Security forces in?""
""Uhh...Yes sir. Right away, sir."" Sergeant Taylor handed the phone back to the major. ""I'll get started immediately.""
Returning to his desk, he noticed an email that had been distributed to the entire unit, Cyber7 eyes only. He opened the attachment and immediately regretted doing so. The file was a gay porn image, with a caption added to describe it.

"So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly.
It's funny, but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long, what I have lived for my entire life, only then, when I achieved immortality I started truly aging.
5 world wars have passed, and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often, I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own, the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced, a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times, a mechanism that when lost all of which it had, had me loosing my will to live, for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence.
Acceptance, something so important. a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times, an ability that looks so easy to achieve, a gift, that I wasn't able to aquire in all my years, until now. When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity's fall, I felt as if all of it's weight was crushing me. Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope, a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years, the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was.
If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy, it can..
I can't feel my legs, I have walked for days, just to hear the sound of gravel, crushed bones, crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered, the day in my far past. The day of my rebirth, I took out of my pocket a small plastic box, with nine buttons and a small glass window. I couldn't believe this was our past, I couldn't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet, be destroyed by our own violence.
I slowly dialed the number I was given, exactly 1729 years ago.
I dropped a tear, a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me.
A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me, I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack...
""You have finally arrived"" He projected into my mind, with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice.
""I'm ready to obey"" I answered. I knew who was sitting infront of me, and it was time for me to obey him, after all these years of playing god, even I came to it.
Funny isn't it? Even by achieving immortality, death, is inescapable.",0
"I sat down waiting for him to come by. It's probably going to be another boring conversation talking about some horrible topic which will never benefit any of us in the long run. Oh, here he comes, with his ridiculous smile on his face, and slumped sholdires.
""How are you. Tavel?"" He extends his hand as if I am supposed to shake it. He waits for a second then sits down.
""I can't believe that you actually came,"" I say, watching his eyes dart around the room unfocused.
""Why wouldn't I""
""Because you're a coward"" Everyone who saw him knew it. ""You're afraid to write anything, to make anything, You are wasting your endless creative talent sitting in your room wishing you could be me"" I had cut him deep, and that was worth it.
""And you""
""Admittedly, I have not done much with my life but at least I am doing something. Sure no fancy hotels, or names in the newspapers, but I can afford going to the Bahamas every year, something you will never achieve""
""Why is that?""
""Because, I am focused, I am risk taking and I am more grounded in reality than you will ever be"" Just watching his face churn gave me pleasure. ""You think your silly Bible can get you somewhere in life. It's ludicrous""
He smiled, looked down at the ground and returned his glance at me ""I can see why you would think that. You do have success, fortune, and power, but you are empty""
""Empty,"" I ask
""Empty and stupid. That's not bad, mind you, but it does allow this pride to get in the way""
""Fair point, but do you think you're smarter than me""
""Definitely more satisfied""
""How"" I yell ""Because you can dream up all you could ever want because you never needed to take the initiative because you grew up as a white male in a decent home. You had every advantage given to you, and you did nothing with is, so I deserve what I have gotten""
""I think we're done here,"" He says with a grim expression
""I am not the coward here"" I yell to him as he walks away ""I am better than you will ever be"" He doesn't even look back. ""At least I don't have to justify my speciality by claiming I'm a pedophile"" That got him to look back. A tear wells up in his eye, and he runs away. The grin on my face slowly grows into a smile, then I start laughing. I may lack creativity or satisfaction, but I am successful on my own merits, and I don't need anyone else to help me.
""Damn you"" I whisper under my breath ""Damn you and your infernal control over our body""",0
"It didn't make sense. In the dead of night, when the waters calmed from the great storm, I heard the lapping sound of a swimmer in the water coming towards me. The moon was peaking over the horizon shedding the caps of the waves with a white glow. It was indeed what I thought I was hearing. The object splashed against the whitecaps and made its way towards me.
The last clouds from the storm flew across the sky, to reveal the stars and Milky Way. It was a beautiful sight as the object reached the edge of my boat.
Part of me was curious who it may be, while a greater part of me was completely mortified. Its hand reached over like a wet towel being slung across the top of a lounge chair and a few seconds later a head popped up.
""Ey, ya, would you help up?"" said a young man's voice, the moonlight shining behind his head.
I scrambled to grab his hand and pulled him into the boat. He was in nothing but a swimsuit and didn't look to be above the age of 25.
""Thanks,"" he said, finding a comfortable corner in the boat to lay in. ""Quite the storm, huh?""
""Yeah,"" I said. ""I was almost out of food and water before the storm and then it hit. Now I'm completely out."" He gave a little chuckle.
""I'm Rudy,"" the man said, giving a brisk wave of his hand. ""I'm sorry I didn't carry some food and water with me. I thought for sure I wouldn't be seeing anyone out here tonight.""
""Rudy?"" I said. ""Ha, that's my favourite movie. You heard of it?""
""Of course. Happens to be one of my favourites too,"" he said, sitting up.
""What were you doing out here, by the way?"" I asked. ""I didn't see any ships in the storm.""
""Oh, I just happen to follow storms quite a bit. You could say I like to clean up the messes they leave behind.""
I noticed then how cold the night truly was. Wrapped around me was my Thermo blanket and it was keeping me warm, but Rudy had nothing but a swimsuit.
""Aren't you cold,"" I asked. ""I think I have another blanket in my emergency kit.""
""Me? Heck, no. I don't get cold,"" he said. ""Nope, nope, the cold doesn't bother me.""
""So you're like that marathon runner that runs shirtless in the winter time,"" I said. ""The Iceman, I think his name is?""
Rudy laughed again. ""I guess you could say that. But the 'man' part might be a bit of a stretch.""
His comment caught me off guard. I looked at his with a more careful eye as the moon grew higher in the sky. Somehow I never noticed the set of wings on his back.
""You're an angel?"" I asked.
""Yes, Alex Nuible,"" he said. ""The passage into death is a traumatic one, but every so often we get the chance to see death coming in people. You've been out to sea for awhile now and with that storm, it was all but definite that the storm would take you.""
I realized then the reason I couldn't remember seeing any ships during the storm was because I couldn't remember the storm. I remember seeing the flashes of lightning on the horizon and the rising waves, but then there was nothing.
""Careful!"" Rudy yelled. ""Think too hard and you will remember the pain, the disparity. I've cradled you away from that. Let us start the journey to paradise.""
""How do I know this isn't a dream?"" I asked. ""If I can't remember it happening, how do I know it's real?""
""You don't need to know,"" said Rudy. ""The pain will be excruciating, but after you come with me you will see over time that what I've said is true. Right now reality feels like a dream. It will subside after you've had time to see that...you're not waking up."" Rudy stood up with a solemn expression and walked towards me with his hand extended.
I could not accept, though. Even if this wasn't a dream, I had to see the truth. I had to know, without a doubt, my end had come. With a burst of speed, I stood up and jumped into the fridged water. The memories came flooding back.
I saw the great waves of the storm, rising among the lightning. They rocked my boat violently as it rode the crests and sinks. And then it happened. A huge wave formed above and extended its head until I could see the sky no more. The force of the crash plunged me into the deep ocean water where I was lost in the ocean currents. I struggled to find an escape, but my lungs screamed for air while I was still drowned in water. It was a horrific pain, like letting a thousand needles fall into my lungs and trachea.
In light of the memory, I was no longer in the water, I was in the sky. I saw the moon shining against the surface of the ocean as I soared further and further into the sky. Still hurt from the memory of pain and death, I hung absently in the grip of Rudy as he muttered to himself.
""Always so stubborn. I warn them every time.""

"They always say in fairytales that when a loved one falls into a deep sleep, there's a way to break the curse. Kisses, a spell, a potion, just that there's something out there. But in real life, all we can do is dream.
When I saw him fall asleep early after a rough day at work I smiled and thought how adorable he looked hugging the pillow with a strange intensity. Now that pose feels more like something of his is just hanging on.
I heard that it's contagious. That the entire ward of the hospital we transported him to was shut down after doctors started dropping to the floors, fast asleep, in the middle of their rounds. The entire place was quarantined.
""New virus places hundreds into comas. Public advised to stay indoors.""
And so I did.
Every piece of media I look to continues to cover the story as more and more people are dropping into deep sleep throughout the country. A few reports even cite my husband as patient zero. We're at the point where initial patients are slow starving to death from lack of nutrient intake. This entire epidemic is driving me crazy.
I can't leave the house, I can't go to work. The normal sounds of community have just dropped. The entire city has become a waking nightmare. Well, maybe a better choice of words would suffice.
But I have my fairytales, and I don't think I'm okay with staying inside for any longer. Prince Charming always finds some way to do it and so will I. I'm done with dreaming and have to start doing. Doing something. Anything. Because I am so very tired, and I don't want to wake up in a world like this.",0
"I held on, slowly falling, looking up at the thread in my hands slowly growing longer and longer as it unraveled. Darkness swelling up beneath me, threatening to swallow me whole as I tumble down the mountain of emotions before me. As I fall I see each moment, each feeling that built that mountain. Fear begins welling up inside me, as the fear builds rocky crags begin jutting out. I scramble, trying in desperation to pull myself up on an anchor that never remains still. The never ending unraveling is no lifeline. I look back down at the blackness, continuously growing as I feel myself becoming consumed by fear. Glancing back up I see the largest crag jut out, just in time to see the thread catch. Praying and hoping that it catches and saves me, it snaps.",0
"I'm turning 24 in a month and I'm really concerned, please read. I'm a 3L at Harvard, yea fricking Harvard. I studied my ass off to get into here. Harvard, the pinnacle of legal intellect and education. I'm sorry if that came off as brag; I can assure you it wasn't. I studied quite extensively my past three years. I'm graduating next week, in the top 10% of my class. My parents are proud, my friends ecstatic. I'm from a small town in New Jeresy where nothing much happens. Yes I know it's cliche but it's the truth; so when I got my acceptance letter from Harvard I became the talk of the town. Although I haven't yet received my JD, I've already received several job offers from renowned law firms. It seems I'm all set in terms of my career and financial stability. However, I'm feeling more lost now than I ever was.
Here comes another cliche, so please bear with me. I always wanted to pursue a field in graphic design. The way animators seamlessly design intricate characters with such meticulous attention to detail. Drawing is what I consider the quintessential foundation for every artist. However, my draconian parents opposed it. They believed that any career outside of law, business, and medicine would not provide a stable source of income. They also attempted to warrant their decision by stating my ""innate talents' would be wasted on graphic design and my brain could be put to better use by studying something like law or medicine. Me being the passive, obedient child, I decided to drop the subject and simply obey them. In retrospect, I wish I studied graphic design back in undergrad. Let this be a lesson to anyone who's reading; if you have the conviction and passion to follow your dreams, don't let anyone dissuade you from your true dreams. Fin.",0
"We expected the first printout to be something simple. ""Hello,"" would have been an expected first message. Maybe even a couple of questions, asking who else was out there. Instead, when the dot matrix printer churned out the first message, Johnny took it in his hands and narrated.
TURN
ME
OFF.
We were confused by this. It was not something that any of the previous attempts that resulted in near-AI had said. Even so, we took it as a promising sign that the newest model was defying pattern and expectations - something a true AI would do. Sarah typed back to the computer a basic question: ""Why?""
As soon as she hit the enter key, the printer began to whir again. Johnny read aloud as the words came out, each on their own individual line.
THERE

NO
POINT.
Up until this point, we had always programmed self-preservation and sustained functioning into the code for the AI models. Sarah typed in again the question ""Why?"" and the computer responded.

"I'm tired.
Physically drained, mentally exhausted, spiritually bereft and otherwise kaput.
Why am I so thoroughly wiped? I'm wiped because I *care* too damned much.
Who do I blame for my current situation? Not that it matters really, but I blame humanity.
That's right. I blame the entire race of men for my exhaustion. I blame you upright, sentient apes for the hopeless feeling that's been giving me nightmares on good nights, worry filled insomnia on bad nights and a panic fueled gnawing in my gut for the past 12 years.
Why? Because you never *learn*! You ***never*** have and you ***never*** will!!
I'm tired and I'm done. I've had it with everyone of you.
As of this moment, I am leaving every thing behind. Every Starbucks, iPhone, Wi-Fi, all of it. **D-O-N-E** **Done! **
I am past caring about the partisan politics, I don't care about reality television, and I could give a sunny shit about A-D list celebs and who they're boning!
I am walking away from my lame job, my shit hole apartment, and my safe-for-the-environment-but-cost-me-out-the-ass-smart car. I'm taking what I had in my bank account and charting a course to somewhere where I cannot be bothered by ***ANY*** of you self absorbed ass hats.

"""Shit, SHIT. OH MY GOD!"" half breathed ben aloud. ""What the hell am I going to tell his mom?"" he screamed. Gun still pointed at the other ""Travis"". He mind was racing a thousand miles a minute. He had just shot his best friend. All this back and fourth talk between the two. He had even quizzed them both. He was sure he had picked the clone. ""How could I not know I was being tricked?"" he whispered.
Thats when it happened, the ceiling exploded into a million tiny shards of glass. They were here, and they wanted their property back. He thought back to the day him and travis stumbled upon that little secret. He remember how they were going to change the world with it. He couldn't help but to smirk. Back then they were so naive. So much time had past since then and everything that had come to light in their investigation. It was almost worth it. Just almost.
The ropes were slowly falling for Ben, when he decided to plug the trigger. He knew that in just moments there would be a small team surrounding them to recover the stolen property. He knew one bullet to this travis's head and everything they had come for would be gone. He wanted to make sure the they would pay for everything he had lost. CLICK. The round is sent spinning through the chamber of the.45. Sent on it destructive course for the hard bone and soft brain matter of this abomination. But the bullet never meets its target. Instead it is stopped just short. As it falls to the ground, he knows who is here. But there was no time left, so he turns and starts to run toward the car. ""They will come for me"" he thinks to himself as he gets into the car. ""But for now I will wait till that day comes"" he says as he starts the car and lunges down the road and around the corner.",0

"It took three months of saving a few cents a day before I was able to make sure I had a cake. Chocolate-flavored ones with ice cream filling was always my favorite when I was younger. I live alone, since the rest of the money was used to both survive and send the rest of my family overseas. The regime has tightened its hold on who was allowed in and out, so we all decided that it would be best to get out as fast as we could. I would be the last one to leave, and I'm honestly content with that. As long as they made it through, all would be well.
I invited the last of my friends over to celebrate with me. Although I was a recluse, I still managed to scrape up some connections when I was at school. Many of them also decided to jump ship after the border patrols first started shooting at humanitarian aid convoys, but a few decided to stay for the sake of keeping what we could together. With everyone leaving, it was getting harder to keep up with getting things to run smoothly at the rec center and the soup kitchen. All hands would be needed to make sure this small panic didn't ruin it all.
Knocking at the door interrupts the usual quiet at my flat. I slowly open the door and find them lined up and ready with the balloons. A popular tradition, these balloons have always brought people together with the revelations inside them, ranging from past embarrassing experiences with your old uncle Ivan to prophecies of wealth and prosperity. My small circle is always at the ready to play this strange game of roulette, as the banter makes for some of the more interesting experiences we've had.
I've never been an extravagant person. I never really liked splurging money on festivities, even though everyone had some sort of karaoke machine that would keep neighbors up until dawn. If you were to ask me, a quiet evening with the people closest to me is the best gift you could give. I do miss the birthday cards, though. An acknowledgment of my existence from my scattered kin has always helped me take a cheery perspective on life, at least for the one day meant for me. At least I won't be alone, something which I was afraid about when I first sent my sisters away.
We started off by watching a newly released movie in my mess of a room. There are rumors circulating around that the bigots who run the country are going to also start clamping down on media, so we thought it best to watch it while we could. After the two hours of watching the protagonist complete his life-long dream of securing a purple banana, I aggravated my relationship with my friends by siphoning them of cash in Monopoly. It's not like we're going to be here for much longer, so a last game in our homeland is something we're surely going to remember once we head off.
Finally, we move to the kitchen for the cake ceremony. It usually consists of a few variations of a ""Happy Birthday"" song before we consume the dessert. We then pop the balloons. My friends were only able to find one for me this year, but that's one more than I was expecting. I take a seat around the table, made of wood of a pine tree my great-grandfather had cut down nearly eighty-five years earlier. They soon follow my lead, leaving one seat empty since there weren't enough of us to completely fill the table. Having every seat filled is a custom invented by my own family, but this will have to do. The songs are sung in awful off-key tones, but we don't respect each other for our potentials to make it into a professional choir. I pick one to cut the cake for me, serving me the first slice. I take a bite before the others are allowed to.
Now the balloons. The poor birthday lad has to pop them himself, bringing about his own ridicule or congratulations. I take the fork in one hand, still dripping with melted filling, and set the balloon in the middle of the table with the other. I didn't want to dent the wood, so I had to slowly puncture that blue, deflating air bag so it would pop before the fork made contact with the table. The others, riddled with anticipation, started surrounding the balloon so they could read what had happened, or possibly would happen, after I did. I slowly applied pressure, and soon enough a loud pop emerged from where the balloon used to be. A slip of paper, which was trapped inside, was right there ready to read. I took it, and almost immediately I lost my grip on it. I took a step back, paper slowly swaying down to the carpet in the living room. My friends noticed that my face immediately turned pale, and they rushed to pick it up to see why I was so spooked.

"I walk quickly toward the back of the music hall. Each footfall muffled by the thick carpet.
Senator Jackson makes his way slowly to the restroom, flanked by service detail. I move deftly through an open aisle and out the side-door.
I enter the bathroom ahead of him, and quickly check stalls. I'm alone. I move to the handicap stall and close the door, standing with one foot on the toilet and one foot on the bar.
I hear the door open and a serviceman walks through. As I expected, he's too lazy to check the stalls, he just leans under looking for feet. When he doesn't see any, I hear him exit.
Senator Jackson walks in and stands at the sink. I hear the water turn on.
I slowly lower myself to the ground. I slip under from stall to stall, until I'm directly behind him.
I take a syringe out of my pocket. Not breathing, I slide gracefully under the stall door.
*Go*. I stand quickly, thrusting my left arm around his neck. My fingers find his chin and pull outward, exposing his jugular. He shrieks, but my palm is shoved in his mouth. I plunge the needle deep into his neck and push the liquid into his throat.
Small air bubbles begin forming at the insertion point. I jerk his head farther with my hand, using my foot to make him fall. I catch him before he hits the ground, and step over him.
Dragging him by his shoulders, I kick the stall door open. I move him back and turn him, carefully undoing his belt. His pants drop to his ankles.
I set him on the toilet seat, and jump above him to the vent in the wall. I pull a small screwdriver from my jacket and undo the screws, removing the cover. I flip, using the safety bar in the stall, so my feet hit the edge of the vent. Upside down, I pull out a tiny coin from my pocket and leave it on Senator Jackson's shoulder. He's unconscious.
I push myself up, and use my feet to slide back into the vent. When my waist meets the opening, I reach down and grab the cover. I pull it in just as the door opens to the bathroom.
I stop breathing and wait.
The serviceman looks around, and bends to look under the stall. Seeing his feet and pants, he stands and walks back out of the bathroom.
As I slide backward through the vent, I reach into my jacket pocket and pull out a phone.
Opening the messenger, I go to the most recent text.
> Quora, 772. Target: Senator Reginald Jackson, Jr.
I hit the text box and a keyboard slides up. I type a message and hit send.
> Quora, 772. Confirm Target Dead.
I shut the phone, and snake my way out. The last thing I hear is the shouting from the direction of the bathroom floating down the duct.",0
"Ten boxing days ago a crack hockey line was sent to the penalty box for a check that was totally legal. These men promptly escaped to the Halifax underground.

Hudson pulled his hockey stick out of the man in front of him. It had been a brutal slash but it wasn't like there was a referee around to call it. ""Sorry about that,"" he spat. Hudson turned to his teammates, they were waiting for him.
""Eh bud, you takin' long enough?"" Abbot asked from on top of the snowbank. His hand was protecting his syrup flask from the crew Moose 'Trudeau'.
""Nah bud""' Hudson said, ""I think I might just take a bit of extra time down by the bank, ya know.""
""Hudson you hoser, we gotta move,"" Layton said from the driver's side of the Zamboni. He'd been acting like more of a leader recently. ""If we don't get moving nobody knows what's going to happen to the prime minister.""
""Oh man, nothin' is gonna happen to the Prime Minister as long as we're on the job,"" Hudson pointed out, ""we're special teams man.""
""Yeah, but we aren't on the penalty kill today,"" Vic scowled. He'd been in a bad mood since the maple syrup had been half full at breakfast. He'd always been a half-empty net kinda guy, but today was more.
""Vic man,"" Hudson started.
""Let's just go out for a rip bud,"" Layton cut in to fix the mood, ""you can have a dart on the way, okay.""
""Man you know I can't have a dart, we're passing within 70 feet of a restaurant when we go down Barrington.
""Ah shoot man, oh well.""
The men arrived at the fortress of Manly Seattle, the head owner of Starbucks, the evil corporation dead-set on replacing Tim Horton's as Canada's favourite coffee.
""Manly Seattle, give back the Prime Minister eh,"" Abbot called out. Manly Seattle didn't answer.
""Eh Hoser!"" Layton yelled.
Still there was nothing.
Like a speeding slapshot Hudson pulled the curtain and showed that there was no man behind it. Manly Seattle was missing. Prime Minister Trudeau had his mouth gagged.
""Oh man sorry about that,"" Layton said as he grabbed the bound and started to untie it. The french man with brilliant hair spat out the rag.
""Layton! Look out!"" the smooth new cool guy screamed.
Layton ducked and a puck came flying over his head. He turned to see who it was. Vic was holding his hockey stick tight in his grasp. Betrayal!
""Vic no!"" Layton said, ""just put the stick down and we can talk about it, okay?""
""I'm not gonna talk about it,"" Vic said, ""I'm done, pick up your stick.""
""Vic,"" Layton started, but Abbot got in the way.
""You're not getting to Layton like that Vic, I'm sorry about this,"" Abbot pulled out his stick. It was time for a shoot out.

"I can always see her face. Always. The sensation gets easier every time. Have you ever tried to fly in a dream before, but you only end up awkwardly floating, bobbing around like a leaf stuck between oil and water? If you learn how to relax into that sensation, sinking into the ground that calls you, you can find the past. You can caress it, even thought you can't touch it.
It's pulling yourself out that's hard. Trying to fight against the gravity of your own dream to make it to the present. Knowing that you have to drag yourself through the pain and the misery of what prevents you from ever knowing that sensation again, just to meet the present. And what does the present offer, if just a perspective point of the future?
So why not try the opposite, you ask? Press forward against that dominating force that is my mind, and soar beyond the restraints of my current perception?
Well *I* ask, what becomes of a mind when it has known the sun, and is relegated to only fireworks? Bold, and pompous, and provocative, perhaps, but flashes that fade none-the-less. How soon would you be bored of the display when all you seek is the constant light that creates the warmth and shade of your day?
You, *you* are beholden to the past. You must answer its every concrete truth. You must justify that as the bedrock of your future, every day.
Why do you ask me about these powers? Don't you see? Because I always have the past, I will never leave it. Because I can see the future, I have no need of it. Now leave me be.",0

""WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?"" Loretta stepped out of the shower and onto the wet floor.
""Alpha, Omega, I am he who is called I am, you know the dri-"" GOD stopped as HE saw Loretta slip, she fell onto the edge of the shower tub and her neck bent unnaturally. HE sighed, pointed at her, and she rose up as if pulled by strings. With a snap of HIS finger, her neck returned to its proper position.
""Loretta Jones, 32 years old, assistant finance manager at Brunk & Spurlock, has never lived farther than 25 miles from her hometown of Sacramento, California, dreams of one day meeting Peter Falk, I am your creator.""
She brought her hands to her mouth as her feet returned to the tile floor, the water giving a quiet splash.
""Tell me, Loretta, what were you just thinking about?""
""Umm, nothing. Nothing at all.""
HE smiled.
""How often do you think about nothing?""
""Pretty often, I guess.""
""Loretta, what would you do if I told you that you think about nothing more than anyone I've ever met before?""
""I guess I'd be inclined to believe you, sir.""
HE laughed.
""I'm going on vacation, going to spend a few weeks as a capybara. I need someone to take over, someone who truly understands how the universe works. Can't let Jesus do it, he'd cure diseases and - trust me - they serve some purpose. Momo would give everyone raisins, and Sidd would end suffering. I need someone like you, after all omnipotence means anything you think of instantly comes true.""
""What are you asking me?""
""If I needed you to think of nothing until I returned, would you do that favor for me?""
Loretta's quivering hand fell from her mouth and swung up to her forehead, a soggy post-shower salute.
""Good!"" HE said and in an instant HE was no longer, and where HE disappeared the steam swirled. Loretta grabbed her hot pink towel and waddled to the living room. Her husband was cooking in the kitchen, the loud vent fan was running on high.
""Were you singing in there? I could hear you halfway across the house.""
""I met God himself, he gave me infinite power and knowledge for an indiscriminate amount of time.""

"Ahmed had been under interrogation for a week now without showing any signs of cracking. His beard had been cut off and dark circles had formed around his eyes as a result of sleep deprivation. His fingers had finally scabbed up. They had thought ripping his fingernails out one by one would have been enough to break him, but they didn't know how strong he was. He would die before breaking, he knew this in the depths of his heart.
Agent Williams was watching Ahmed from behind the one way glass. She saw the look of steely determination in his eyes and knew that this was not going to be an easy task. Sighing, she pulled out her phone and dialled a number. ""Get me Agent Kowalski. We are going to have to use the Madison Protocol."" A momentary silence followed, before she heard a reply. ""Roger that.""
Ahmed was blindfolded and led into a room. His arms and legs were chained to a chair. Two agents held him down, while a third agent pried his eyes open. A fourth agent delicately taped Ahmed's eyelids to his face. Ahmed struggled fiercely, but a week of minimal eating had left him weak and unable to resist. Fear gripped the pit of his stomach as something was injected into his arm. He thought, ""What is it that they will subject me to? God have mercy.""
A projector whirred into action behind him and the white wall directly ahead of him suddenly came to life with the Touchstone Pictures logo. As a theme song blared from all directions, Ahmed felt at ease. He laughed to himself, ""Movies? This is your big plan?""
The Waterboy had been playing for an hour now and raucous laughter could be heard coming from Ahmed's room. Agent Kowalski watched from the adjoining soundproof room and smiled. He knew that the MDMA that they had injected into Ahmed would have definitely kicked in. ""Boy I bet that son of a bitch is feeling pretty great right now."" He smiled knowingly as he watched Ahmed, who was laughing away at Adam Sandler's antics. ""Thank god this room is soundproof.""
Happy Gilmore started playing as soon as the credits for the Waterboy had finished. Ahmed felt at ease, his brain melting in a cocktail of happy chemicals. He watched and rooted for Happy Gilmore as he climbed the top of the Golf ladder.
It was around halfway through Anger Management that Ahmed started to get sick of hearing Adam Sandler's voice. And how many times were they going to show someone being hit in the balls? These things had begun to get on Ahmed's nerves. Kowlaski smiled once more from behind the one way glass. He knew the MDMA had begun to wear off. It was only the beginning.
I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry was the next movie. Ahmed spat at the thought of homosexuals and indeed, homosexuality was punishable by death in his home country. Even still the barrage of terrible gay jokes made him feel bad for having seen them. And Adam Sandler's voice now took on the characteristics of fingernails squealing on a chalkboard. The drugs had worn off now, leaving his brain bereft of the chemicals necessary for happiness. Ahmed struggled against his restraints and tried to close his eyes. But it was no use.
Angry screams could be heard as You Don't Mess with the Zohan played. Ahmed wished nothing but death to the Jew dogs of this world, but this was something else. Worse still was Rob Schnieder's portrayal of a goatherd. Rage welled up inside of him every time that ridiculous caricature came on screen. Behind the one-way glass, Kowalski chuckled once more.
It had been almost ten hours. What hard started off as a respite from torture had turned out to be something far worse. Now, Little Nicky was playing. ""WHY IS HE SPEAKING IN THAT STUPID VOICE??? IS HE GOING TO KEEP DOING THAT FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE???"" Ahmed began to scream and scream. Kowalski smiled and reached for a dial. The volume in the room grew louder and louder until Ahmed's screams were drowned out by Adam Sandler's voice. It was like someone was rubbing a cheesegrater against Ahmed's head and he could do nothing to stop it. ""We are getting close now"" chuckled Kowalski, once again thankful to be in a soundproof room.
Twelve hours. No food or water. Ahmed had screamed himself hoarse by this point. Before Grown Ups had started playing agents entered the room to inject him once more. Blinding pain coursed through his eyes, but he could not close them. All he could do was watch Adam Sandler and his friends piss in a public pool.
Agent Williams walked into the soundproof room. ""What's the status?"" Kowalski turned around. ""We should go and interrogate him after this. Offer to end this if he chooses to co-operate."" Williams looked through the one way glass and watched Ahmed, whose eyes were now glazed over. Eyes that had once held such determination were now completely empty. She turned around. ""And if he chooses not to co-operate?"" Kowalski smiled deviously as he opened a drawer and pulled out a DVD. ""We always have this."" Williams looked at the cover with shock.

"Of the many tales one will hear of the great battles of the Western Front, doted upon by the Parisians of old, those men who would get drunk on the grape of the vine, none stands as foreboding as the tale of Strong Booted Archie of Lincolnshire.
It was Premiere Alistair who had begged Archie to come to the side of the French and fight saying to him, ""Was it not I who insisted upon offering you gifts of the best land Champagne has to offer, or bringing you the women of Spain for whom the invading Germans are most willing to take hold of?"" He said all of this through his messanger and wisest of council, Otto, son of Leo. Archie, whom all the Allies adored and looked to, spoke saying this, ""Otto, you are a good man and admired greatly among the French and I would be honored to carry your rifle. But Alistair has dishonored me by taking back my lovely Brittany. She was finest of my spoiles. My captured Leichter Kampfwagen! My beautiful chariot with an attached fifty-seven millimeter Maxim-Nordenfelt that I was to ride into battle with. He has dishonored me and taken this from me! I will not battle this day, and it will be given over to the Germans for his arrogance!""
It was at these words Otto, who was good with the artillery, returned to Premiere Alistair saying these things. And Alistair, bon cri de guerre, faced no alternative but to march his forces against the great Von Hectenstein.
Archie knew of the great danger faced by the French and did nothing. His friend and companion Peter, son of Martin, knew this also and turned to Archie saying, ""My friend we have fought together against these damned Germans for too many years. If you will not take to the trenches and fight, then let me get in your armored Rolls-Royce and lead a battalion to fight. Otherwise Von Hectenstein will win this battle and quite possibly the war. Then where do you think the Axis will push to next? They will land their Eulers and their Godeckers and will force themselves upon our own land of the crown! And what will happen to our own dear Lincolnshire? It will be burned to the ground and our women and children left to speak German! I can't have that. Let me drive your Rolls-Royce into battle and let the Axis believe Archie of Lincolnshire has overcome his pride and stepped into battle once more!""
Archie, son of Paul and Tessa, dame from across the pond, heard these words from Peter and said, ""Peter you gorgeous man if only it were just you and I to take on the Axis alone we would bomb all of Russia and have it to ourselves! You take my armored Rolls and drive it straight into the heart of Von Hectenstein! And you come back alive you hear me?!
And Peter, who was an excellent driver and good with a rifle, readied a vehicle and Strong Booted Archie readied a battalion to protect him. Peter rode into battle to test the fates against the terrible Von Hectenstein.

"*The Value of Being Interrupted*
""You can't be serious about going on a trip to Tokyo for New Year's.""
""Um, and why not? You didn't have a problem being there during Jenny's fifth birthday.""
""Really? You're bringing that up? I've told you a hundred times it was an emergency client meeting. I would've lost my job if I didn't go.""
""Oh sure, always worried about losing your job. Never worried about losing your wife.""
""Yeah because losing my wife would make my life easier, not harder.""
""Please! The only thing that makes your life hard anymore is that little slut in Roppongi. Oh yeah, you thought I didn't know about her, didn't-""
""Um. Excuse me.""
""What?""
""What do you want?""
""I don't mean to interrupt, but could you two slow down a bit? I'm having trouble keeping up typing everything.""
""Oh, sorry about that.""
""Do you need us to backtrack on anything?""
""Yeah, actually. Which birthday was it that he missed? I have it down as sixth here but I don't think that's right.""
""It's the fifth. And… yeah. I mean, shouldn't have said that. I know you had no choice, and it was really sweet when you Skyped Jenny and helped blow out her birthday candles.""
""No, you're right. I could've been more supportive. I didn't even say thank you for watching over all those sugar-rushed five-year-olds all by yourself. You were counting on me to help you, and I wasn't there.""
""Um, excuse-""
""Oh don't say that! Jenny loves that stuffed Tokyo Tower plush you brought back for her. You know she can't sleep without it. That was so sweet of you.""
""Hey, that was all Ms. Takahashi's idea. And there's nothing going on between us, you know that. She's my boss. Coming home to you and Jenny is the only thing that gets me through being over there.""
""I know. I just… miss you sometimes. And it's easier when I can be mad at you instead of just mad at our situation.""
""Um, excuse me.""
""What?""
""What do you want?""
""Should I be typing this all down? I know I'm only supposed to record arguments, but does this count?""
""Wait, what were we arguing about?""
""I don't remember. Stenographer, what does the record say?""
""Your wife wanted to go to Tokyo for New Year's.""
""Oh. Right. Sorry about that; it sounds so silly now. Yeah, don't worry about it. It's not worth the expense and I know you're sick of the place.""
""No, actually. Maybe it'd be fun. Jenny's always wanted to go, and I can probably wrangle up something with Ms. Takahashi.""
""Really?""
""Yeah. I could show you my office, we can go to a cat cafe, take Jenny to Disney Sea.""
""Oh that sounds great!""
""Perfect. I'll call her right now actually. She should be just getting into the office right now.""
""Um, excuse me.""
""What?""
""What do you want?""
""Are you going to pay for my plane ticket too?""",0

"""You know, I didn't think cynicism was an emotion."" I mention casually, skirting around the emaciated, mottled grey-black humanoid creature sitting cross-legged on my kitchen table. The, erm, Cynic (I guess?) pulls its curtain of greasy black hair back with one hand and gestures to the hair-tie on my wrist with his other. I toss it to him and duck behind the table to grab a couple of sodas from the box on the floor.
""Well for most people it's probably not."" Cynic answers in a voice that sounds eerily like Jack of Blades from the PC version of Fable. ""But since you developed a ridiculous habit of channeling what little negative emotion you have into fuel for your shitty attitude and rapidly declining sense of humor I get to represent pretty much every negative emotion you have: so that's your pain from your few meaningful rejections, your anxiety about your crashing and burning immediately upon entering your adult life, all of that festering contempt and angst from when you were twelve, the last toxic bits of your episode of existential depression from age fourteen and your overall depressing view of existence. I get to represent all of that because cynical bullshit is all you'll listen too.""
I continue to surprise myself by listening intently to the rant of the horrifying entity of every part of my brain I don't like to think about with absolutely no desire to run or kill it. I mean, the thing's terrifying! It's still hunched on my kitchen table, drinking a soda and smoking what I can only assume is my last cigar. I'm really regretting giving it that hair-tie now. Its entire face is extremely thin and angled, kind of like a much more exaggerated version of high-fantasy elves, with giant, pitch-black eyes, a long, hooked nose like what Sherlock Holmes had in the book, and a mouth stretched into a permanent sardonic grin so big and joker-ish it almost touches the nearly transparent skin stretched tentatively over its jutting cheekbones. When it stretch out to take the soda I also saw thin, jointed appendages folded against its back, they looked like bird wings sans-feathers. Oh god is this thing some kind of bullshit symbol of that ""Every cynic is a failed idealist"" quote?
""I don't think this is a conversation I should be having sober."" I say shakily, pulling a joint from my cigar foil. Cynic nods, pulling his horrifying taloned bird feet from under him and stretching out straight, ""Getting high should get the attention of the other third of this conversation."" He kicks a kitchen chair towards me and I collapse gratefully, lighting the joint and taking a few puffs before passing it.
""Should you be partaking in one of the positive things I have in my life?"" I ask Cynic as he hits it. ""Or is the fact that you can partake of it a sign that it's a negative thing?"" It holds up one bony finger and inhales sharply through its nose, passing me the joint before exhaling out of the window. ""Slow down there Aristotle. I'm also an embodiment of the negative side of your shameless hedonism, you know the part of your brain that drives you to new states of inebriation so that you can escape the life-shortening misery your own worldview and self-pity sometimes causes you? Yeah I get that too. That aside, this'll help keep me from becoming overly whiny and conceited like all of this is when it's in your head.""
I nod sagely, holding my hit, wondering if I'm just having some sort of weird hallucination caused by bi-neural beats and the rampant introspection my narcissism and free time leaves me vulnerable to. A sharp prick on my shoulder brings me around to see what I can only assume is the incarnation of whatever positive emotions I experience.
Sitting on my counter, hitting on my joint, is something entirely different from what is sitting on my table. This one's shorter, but well-proportioned, lean and covered in short black fur, instead of bald, emaciated and stick-like. Its face is also much broader and the jaw much stronger than Cynic's: with abroad, flatish nose, smaller but still overly large and heavy-lidded yellow eyes that I swear are sparkling on their own, and a wide, content smile on a fat-lipped face framed by thick blonde dreadlocks. He holds out a furry hand tipped with broad, curved claws.
""So What do you represent?"" I ask, obliging that scary looking hand. He grins, exposing a mouth full of broad, pointed teeth before taking a hit. ""I-"" He chokes out, struggling to contain the smoke before releasing it in a gout of furious coughing and handing me the joint back, which I spear on the end of a handy-dandy safety pin that is my go-to roach-clip. ""Represent the more positive and healthy parts of your mind."" His voice makes me think of Steve Blume if he was high. ""Your weird sense of confidence that's spawned from cynicism, your sense of contentment that's present when you're high or somewhere nice, that weird euphoria you get when you absolutely lose your shit at someone's joke or they lose their shit at yours, I'm that weird feeling of warmth that you get with that girl you've got absolutely no shot with, I'm your acceptance that the fact you've got no shot with the coolest person you've ever met and you're totally fine with it because you just like hanging out, I'm the positive side of your shameless hedonism that tells you to go out and alter your brain so that you can explore new faucets of you consciousness, I'm that deeply embedded happiness that comes from your knowledge that you live in a universe with more awesome shit than you can ever imagine.""
Another sage nod as I take a hit, hold, pass and exhale. ""So what's up with the claws, and monster teeth?"" He doesn't reply immediately, as he's puffing the roach down, but he does uncurl a previously unseen tail and stretch it towards me, revealing a long spike of bone protruding from the tip. Now that sends a rare pang of fear through me, I still don't know what these fucks want after all. ""I-I-I'll go get the bong."" I stammer before rushing back to my room. ""Remember to change your pants if your shit bricks coming to terms with this!"" Cynic calls behind me.
A few swigs from my secret bottle of vodka and a steadying hit from my borrowed bong helps return to my kitchen to, well, face myself I guess. I shove the bong into Cynic's chest to silence the condescending comment I suspect is coming and retake my seat between the two entities. ""So the claws, fangs and wierd-ass spike tail?.."" I trail off, gesturing vaguely at the entirety of Stoner's form. ""Oh that?"" Stoner laughs a pretty mean laugh, the one I usually produce when I hear or say something really mean. ""That's because all the shit you've ever said that's legitimately hurt somebody, intentional or otherwise? That's me too: I'm also your inner sadist, that pleasure you get from fucking with someone's emotions, or beating on someone during sex, I'm also that twisted amusement that you have when you see someone die, so I'm arguably the worst part of you, from an un-selfish point of view.""
I take my hit and pass the bong, glad that water from last night didn't get too rank. ""Alright then."" I exhale. ""So am I going batshit or is everyone having some kind of vaguely similar meeting?"" Cynic taps a taloned foot on the floor. ""Well it's pretty different for everyone, emotions are pretty universal, but everyone reacts differently."" ""So are everybody's emotional incarnations going to look like total freaks?"" Stoner shrugs and hands the bong back. ""They'll all be unique, but most probably won't be quite as freaky as us. You've got a pretty twisted imagination dude."" ""Okay are you guys going to be visible to everybody and can you communicate with other people?""
""Yes."" Cynic strains. ""And no."" Stoner finishes. ""Everybody can see us, but no one can communicate with us unless they or we have express permission from you. They can touch us but they're really not going to want to, for more reasons than one."" ""Okay so why are you here?"" I ask, accepting the bong. ""Can't say."" They answer simply. ""How long?"" ""Can't say."" ""Oh god school's going to be really interesting tomorrow."" Stoner grins. ""Oh dude hell yeah."" Cynic coughs heavily. ""Can you imagine how fucked up it's gonna be for people with friends?""
Holy shit at that wall of text. Never write high kids.",0
"The stall, with its torn black cover and rundown tables, was located in an alley adjacent to the marketplace. A sign hung from one of the beams, the words carelessly engraved on a metal plate: Used Robot Parts.
The display did nothing to attract customers. Bolts, wires and circuits were scattered across the counters, watched over by a shabby-looking youth. He watched the passersby disinterestedly, and met enquiries into his wares with indifference bordering on rudeness.
A tall elderly man approached the stall. ""Do you have Iridian Processing Boards?"" he asked in a low voice.
The youth jerked his head in assent. ""Specifications? Name? Number?""
""Give me..."" The man scratched his white beard. ""Something that begins with 021. I want to know their occupation before I purchase.""
The youth typed some words into a round tablet that he held in a pouch around his neck. ""021339, a botanist. Or 021999, a consultant for RemTech. Or 021870, oh, but I don't suppose you'll want this one."" A scowl crawled on the youth's features as he lifted his eyes to face the elderly man. ""Miner.""
The customer let out a short laugh. ""No indeed. I'll take the RemTech consultant.""
""3000 Damats,"" said the vendor blankly. The youth unlocked the steel cabinet at the back of the stall, concealed behind a dark curtain. After a quick search, he pulled out a small glass vial filled with a clear liquid. On the tag around the cork, the numbers 021999 had been printed, along with the date of extraction and other details in minuscule writing. The man had pulled out a payment card, which he handed to the youth. It was undoubtedly untraceable and anonymous. The youth tapped it against his tablet and gave it discreetly back to the man, along with the vial.
""We thank you for your interest,"" said the youth in a tone that suggested otherwise.
""Give my regards to your boss,"" said the elderly man as he left.
Another man, this one younger and more conspicuously dressed, approached the stall. A stunknife flashed on his belt, visible beneath his cloak as he moved.
""Speak of the devil,"" said the youth, not bothering to mask his dislike of the newcomer.
Ressick smiled, showing perfectly aligned white teeth. He entered the stall and put his arm around the youth. ""Sam, Sam, Sam. That tongue of yours...How's business?""
""Good, sir,"" said Sam.
""I am glad to hear it. But you'll want to be more gracious to our customers, won't you? Remember, you belong to me 065537."" With another smile, he walked away.
The youth watched him depart with disfavour. He waited several minutes, then pulled out of his pocket a small glass vial and a dropper. The number 021870 was printed on the tag. Sam toyed with it between his fingers, then unstoppered the vial. He pinched the bulb of the dropper and drew some of the clear liquid. He faced away from the marketplace, and deposited a drop into his eye. Quickly, he put the bottle back in his pocket. He'd place it back in the cabinet when the next customer came. No one would miss a drop. Especially not when the memories had belonged to a miner.
Sam blinked. Blurry images swam in his mind. A woman laughing, in her hand a red flower. He had never held a flower. The woman was looking out towards the sea. It was not like the sea that Sam knew. The sun shimmered on a blue surface. White birds flew in the sky. The woman was still laughing, happiness visible in every feature.
It was almost unbearable. Out of all the memories Sam had stolen, the happy ones caused him the most pain. This memory, like many others belonging to members of the lowest classes, had most likely been sold for money. Those memories had less value and were considered less desirable. What knowledge could the poor have? What great events of worth could they have experienced? But still they held emotions and beauty Sam had never felt. He wondered, as he often did, what circumstances would lead someone to exchange the memory of such happiness for a pittance.
Drawn by the lingering image of the smiling woman, he placed another drop in his eye. This time, he saw young girls, bearing a stunning resemblance to the woman, dancing on the beach around a fire at dusk. The sound of laughter mesmerized him; it contrasted with the grey marketplace, and the harsh noises around him. Smoke filled his lungs. He longed for the clear air, for bright faces. Hesitating, Sam placed another drop in his eye. And another, and then another still. The bottle was now half empty. *One last drop*.
This time, he saw something else.",0
"I like playing games. I like to play hide and seek, I like to pin the tail on the donkey. But the game I like best is piñata. When we have a piñata, me and my friends get to hit the piñata with a bat until all the candy comes out, and everyone gets some candy.
But we don't always have a piñata, so sometimes we have to make believe. I like to pretend to be the piñata. I put on a blindfold because real piñatas can't see. It's part of the game. I stand in the middle of the room. Sometimes, they even put rope on me. We pretend I'm hanging from the ceiling like a real piñata. Just dangling there, like an object.
Everyone gets to take a turn. Each of my friends steps up, grabs their bat, and tries to knock the candy out. And just like with a real piñata, some people can't. Some of my friends hit really hard. They swing as hard as they possibly can. Other people try to aim just right, hit just the right spot. But even if they don't get the candy out, they still have fun. Everyone likes to take a turn. It's fun when all your friends are cheering you on when you're swinging your bat. Most people take at least two turns, sometimes three! I like being fair, so I like when everyone gets a few turns each.
Finally, after enough people have had a turn, someone will hit just right. When they do, I shout for joy! And like a real piñata, I have candy hidden, so when someone hits right, I throw my candy on the floor. Everyone in the room cheers loudly. They all like candy. Even after all the candy has fallen to the floor, some of my friends like to keep playing. They'll keep taking turns because they like to swing the bat.
Just like a real piñata, my friends untie me and take what's left of me down from the ceiling. There is usually a lot of candy left on the ground. Sometimes, someone has eaten some of it. But a lot of times, my friends are really nice. They let me have the candy. I get down on my hands and knees, and I eat the candy right off the ground. It's so tasty. And it tastes even better knowing everyone is watching me eat it. Cleaning up is important, and when I'm done, there's no more candy left on the ground.
And that's how you play piñata, even when you don't have one. In fact, I'm going to go play now. I have a lot of candy hidden this time!",0
"I still remember how beautiful she looked on the day of our wedding. Her white dress with rhinestones shining in the morning sun as she walked. The contours of her body as an almost perfect hourglass filling out the dress almost as if it was a part of her skin. Her veil was lifted. Eyes the colour of chips of ice stared at me, piercing and taking control of my mind; stirring the exact same feelings as the day I first saw her. Her hair was a light brown with a natural wave that flowed to her breast so perfectly nobody would guess that it was natural. A smile appeared when she saw me that I shall remember for the rest of my time on this earth.
For our honeymoon we travelled across Asia and visited several monasteries. My favourite was on top of a mountain that took the better part of 4 hours to climb. The building itself was red brick, surrounded with gold statues of different deities ranging from 8 feet all the way up to 20 feet tall. The building itself seemed to touch the clouds, as if connected to something that we could never understand.
The monks that lived there often spoke of death, and how it is not wise to fear death; rather we should embrace it. I asked what happens when we die and I was given an incredibly simple answer; an answer that I fully understood, but could never fully comprehend.
""Do you remember what it was like before you were born?""
""No.""
""That's what it's like when you're dead.""
I always found comfort in that. Not a comfort as one would have when wanting reassurance that everything would be alight, but a comfort that in the end, the only thing that matters is what you have done with your time on this earth.
My wife never understood that. She was always overly terrified of death, in the same manner that a young child reacts when a bee flies near them. When cancer took her from me last week all I can remember was how scared she had been. She begged me never to leave her side and was constantly searching for alternative medications aside from the chemo. She was scared for the last few months of her life, and it took its toll on her. Some days I think being scared of dying was what really killed her, not the cancer.",0
"*What the shit am I doing here? *
""Um...ahem."" I step forward on the podium and feel the attention of at least 5 billion people bubbling beneath the crowd and the cameras.
""People of Am- of Earth...my will is absolute..."" *Yes? And? * ""...and I feel the time has come...the time...for a new type of leader to...."" *Just say something! Anything! * ""...grab the world by its hair, and...."" *Okay maybe tone down the imagery there* ""...and launch it back towards the moon!""
For some reason that was met with smatterings of applause and whoops, and I stood there feeling the sweat from my brow seeping into my eyes.
""This country.... no, this world..."" I started, my eyes beginning to water, ""...has been a plague on the end of my...shoe...."" *Mmm, okay* ""...for too long!""
Again there was voracious applause from the crowd, and I grinned weakly at the knowledge that I still had to talk for another fifteen minutes. ""Today...I -""
Somewhere in the distance a loud crack echoed through the surrounding trees, and I felt a sharp impact in my chest. Looking down slowly, my hand came up red.
*Oh thank God. *",0
"I had been in an minor earthquake in Japan a few years ago during a business trip. I remember the disorienting feeling being the most overwhelming aspect for me. To experience that as an adult for the first time...it felt like a revelation. I started considering things I had simply never bothered with before. Reading about such events in science books simply does not do it justice. You can't grasp the true power of something like that until you're in the middle of it. That disorientation is what I felt when the planet spoke to us. Not in words, not in any language we could even imitate. It spoke in earthquakes, but we understood it perfectly. We ALL did. All 9 billion of us.
The first rumble was so subtle, the few of us who heard it clearly (I was one of those) didn't understand what it was. We didn't understand what it had said. By the time the next rumble came, only minutes later, some had already gone mad. It was just too much to absorb for some. I was paralyzed with fear, standing in the middle of a park as my dog ran away from me, with three other dogs following him. We now know they were being called. At the same time it informed us of our true nature, and of our imminent doom, it spoke to the others a whole other message.
The third rumble came an hour after the second, but we didn't feel it beneath our feet, that time. We felt it in our minds. Our memories bounced around. Our individual knowledge changed. Our collective knowledge was unlocked. We begun seeing more and more, understanding more and more. More of us went mad. The suicides began. No more rumbles after that. The message had been sent...
It has been a week since that day, and somehow, despite all our new found knowledge, most of us refuse to accept the facts. We're still debating, still depending on politicians to make their secret plans, and speak among themselves. Still weak. No one really knows what to do. As a species, we are in denial. But we all know what it said to us. All of us heard it in different ways, but we all know what it was telling us. Death. You are sentenced to death. But was it ""death""? No. There was something about the...tone. It wasn't a tone, since it wasn't a voice. But something about the resonance, perhaps, had implied it didn't mean death. The closest word the English language has to it is...reset. That is what I feel in my heart. My sister agrees with me. She heard it much the same way I did.
I felt like I had been let in on a secret, as had everyone else at the time. Scientists couldn't explain the phenomena. There were no detectable emission of any frequencies, no soundwaves, whatever scientific bullshit terms you wanna pin to it. It had none of that. It just was. It told us all what was going to happen. It gave us time to prepare, mentally. Like it cares for us to some extent.
Now I'm hearing about some religious group gaining a massive following. They call the planet ""Mother"" and are committing mass suicides across the globe to try and save the rest of us. Saying that if we bring our numbers down enough, maybe the rest of us can be spared. Nonsense. There was no room for negotiations. It said what needed to be said. It gave us a farewell.
The collective consciousness has been growing. We're getting new bits of information every day, but it seems to come in slow dribbles. As if not everyone's participating. We know that the planet let us evolve for one reason only. We were to be the repellent. We were to be its defensive system against whatever threats may have come its way. We are a failed experiment.
We know we are not the first. The octopus was the dominant sentient species for a while, but they were more like a rough draft. A first attempt that just didn't pan out. But now we know they're gone from the seas. No one's fished any of them in days. Same with honeybees. They're all gone. Cats, dogs, horses, cows, all gone or going. Some owners have already been killed trying to keep their pets indoors. Dolphins in captivity have been acting near-suicidal, trying to find sea-water. They jump from their tanks and try to crawl away. Chickens are still around, and so are most reptilians, though not many have bothered checking more closely. Either way, no one knows where they've all disappeared to. But we all know we are not going wherever they did.",0
"""Why can't you be a café maiden, like your older brother?""
I found myself screaming at my daughter. She stood before me, bold as brass, right smack in the middle of our family business dressed as a magical girl. The one thing I promised her mother would never happen.
""The world is in peril,"" she said. Stating the too obvious.
""The world is always in peril!"" I said, ""When are you going to get it through your head there is always going to be a giant monster, or werewolves, or vampires, or some giant rampaging transgendered jabberwocky roaming the world somewhere, but it is not for you to save us from it.""
""I was chosen father!"" she said.
She raised a staff above her head and transformed right there, into her battle form, with the whole café watching. Magical girl outfits were always on the unmodest side but this outfit was deliberately pushing it to the extremes. It made it extremely obvious, Maaya was not a little girl anymore. Ever since she had grown much taller than me, her father, she had been getting increasingly rebellious. Looking up at this enchanted Titania reminded me of her mother, which was not helping with my mood.
""Magical girls always lead to a bad end,"" I pleaded with her.
Then I pointed to my eldest son, Yukio, serving drinks at the far end, trying his best in vain to draw attention away from us.
""Look at your brother! A handsomer man in a maid outfit you will never find, and proud of it! He'll be graduating from business college just a few years and I will hand over the café to you two and retire. I can't handle my children spending their lives fighting evil. Always in danger!""
""Mother was a magical girl, father!"" screamed Maaya, ""She protected us from danger. You have no idea what you're talking about.""
That was the last straw. I pulled small baton from my maid apron showed this little upstart how one properly transforms into a magical girl. A bright sprinkling pink dress with the cat ears of a warrior I had not worn in over a decade. With panties, garters, and fishnets, not this g-string and tattoo nonsense they tarted around in these days.
Maaya was of course stunned.
""You...you were Kamaya Catboy? The great defender of the city?""
My baton transformed into a great staff which I thumped upon the floor to emphasize I was putting my foot down. Magical thunder shook the city with my might.
""Now you know I do know what I'm talking about.""
I gripped my staff with both hands as I fought to find the courage to retell the most painful memory of my life.
""Your mother and I fought together to send Queen Athaliah, back to the netherworld, that battle cost your mother her life. As she lay dying in my arms I promised I would do everything I could to keep you and your brother safe. The both of you were just babies at the time. I had to raise you alone. I did everything I could to keep you two away from magical questing so you would not pick up your mother's curse. That's what it means to be a magical girl. You will fight until you die or you see you loved ones killed! You're too young to understand what it can cost you.""
""I understand that if you refuse to defend this city as Kamaya Catboy, someone has to take your place,"" said Maaya.
She pointed her staff at my own and fired a magical beam of lighting, causing me to drop it. Just like her mother, she was much more powerful than I, and far more stubborn. If she wanted to fight evil, I couldn't stop her. In the distance there was another rumble. Some great Kaiju or some other damn thing was rising from the sea to have a bit of a snit at the city. Maaya took to the air, like an avenging angel.
""I'm going, father,"" she said, ""Please don't banish me from home for disobeying you.""
I couldn't stop myself from crying.
""No. Your mother would never forgive me.""
As Maaya flew off I picked up my staff. Something I swore to never pick up again. As I watched Maaya fly into battle through teary eyes, my son Yukio approached me. It was obvious he knew the whole time his younger sister was a magical girl.
""I don't suppose you have some great secret to share with me?"" I asked, stupidly.
Yukio transformed into a black mage. At least the outfit was tasteful, especially compared to his sister.
""She can use a little help, she's a beginner you know,"" he said.
He had a point. Together we took to the air like a team of superheroes, defending the city. If I could not keep my children from danger, the least I could do was train them at my best to gain victory.",0
"""There he is again. He's always looking at the clock. I swear he hasn't blinked in the last five minutes.""
""So what Jeannette, let the freak stare all he wants. Rather he look at the clock then those two tissue stuffed lumps on your chest wouldn't ya?""
""What the hell Sarah! You said you wouldn't mention it! At least I didn't get drunk last Saturday night and make out with Jake when I have a boyfriend""
""Shhhhhh! Shut up Jen someone could hear you. That's not fair and besides, me and Frank have an on and off again relationship so I can make out with however I want.""
""Does Frank know about this?""
""You're just jealous I can get with the boys and you can't.""
""At least when I get a boy he'll be more into to me than in my pants okay.""
""Get your good Christian parent talk out of my face okay.""
""Whatever. Just forget it. Just...help me watch him over there. He's up to something.""
""Look, I know you like him, while he's off watching the clock, you're getting off watching him""
""I can't even begin to believe you would even assume, even think for a second, that I would ever give someone like him the…""
""Oh I think he heard you. He's looking over here now. Nice one Jen. You always were so smooth with the guys weren't you?""
""You don't think he actually heard me do you?""
""Oh yeah he did. Why's it even matter, I thought you didn't care…""
""It's just that, every day at this hour he stares at the clock and doesn't look away for a few minutes. Every day Sarah. I know it's weird but don't you want to know why?""
""I don't care what that freak does alright. As long as he's not staring at me, it's none of my business. Why don't you just ask him why he does it? I'm sure he would like such a pretty girl to go and talk to him. I mean it would be the best part of his day if...oh he just sneezed. What a dork. There ya go, clean it all up. Get your face all nice and clean for your girlfriend Jen over here""
""Wait a minute. Sarah! Did you just see it? Sarah do you see them?""
""What, he's just wiping his nose right now. What's so wired about that?""
""Yeah, but with my tissues!""
""What?""
""MY BRA…Sarah my bra, the tissues I used to stuff it, they're all gone.""
""Oh my god! How'd he do that? Wait someone's calling me.""
""Who is it?""
""That's weird. It's Frank. Hello? Hey baby I miss…oh…wait baby listen…no I was drunk and he was there…but I didn't mean anything and…Frank don't do this to me…babe…. He hung up.""
""What just happened?""
""He said he got a text from you saying I hooked up with Jake at the party. What the Hell Jen!""
""Wait I didn't send a text.""
""Let me see your phone. See right there! 11:59! Why would you do that to me. I thought you were my friend.""
""I didn't send that. Sarah believe me. I didn't send that.""
""How can I!""
""Just look at the clock. Its 12:02 right now. I haven't touched my phone this whole time we have been talking. I've just been staring at him over there.""
""Then how did it send?""
""It couldn't of been.""
""Oh look he's waving over here and smiling at us. Jen your boyfriend is a freak.""",0
"Level 49 Paladin, schizophrenic calling's, walking through this wall-things all day to come to grips with my prowess. Wow kids, don't let the boogey man boogie in your closet, you must have forgot to lock it, agnostic parents with a pocket full of apocalypse and a head full of spaces. Taste this, another jesus bracelet broke, another spirit invoked, hold on to hope so faith can poke it's head into the realm of the dead.
I spy with my little eye a child teetering on the edge; hold hands with me and the rest of your invisible friends. It's better to break than continue to bend, snap your soul in two and let it mend...was it real? What I saw? What was it truly doing what it did? What was hidden inside of my mind projected or reality neglected...Something segmented and crittering beneath the flowboards of the Trojan horse awoke my paralysis through the sacred doors.
War of the worlds, obsolete factions matching gains and comparing beef-sticks, equipped to rip shit like timid midgets insistent on doing what they didn't. Try not to be so literal, try not to feel intangibles as they creep up your spine, just trust in the sky and the stars will align. I ain't no judge, I ain't no jury, I'm just a boy walkin with a vision too blurry to comprehend foe from friend and truth from trend but then again I can close my eyes and count to ten.. no fingers required, no toes to slow my numeral crusade, okay?",0
"I blink into the silence of North Main Street. The year is 2002, and the trees have begun to wilt into shades of amber. I enjoy the scene – alone. In the storefronts, I see the cut-outs – sitting at the table in my favorite diner, waiting in line for a coffee that will never come, or perusing the dusty old items on the shelves. In the past, I attempted to communicate and learn the faces of all the cut-outs, but I gave up. How long has passed? One year? Ten?
I walk on the cobblestone streets to my old car – a beat up Honda that belonged to my daughter before she gave it to dear old Dad. I remember her voice still, full of concern that I needed to be safe. Amelia's hair used to shine in the sun when she walked through the door, but when I visit her old apartment, she sits at her desk with the luster gone from her hair. I touch her face from time to time, but it's blank. One day, she disappeared like everyone else. I haven't forgotten her yet.
I drive to our family home where my wife and I raised our daughter. Maggie's hair had started to turn grey before she disappeared, but I can still remember the burnished golden locks straying onto my pillowcase. When I walk through the old wooden door, Maggie stands in the kitchen unmoving, and I feel the loneliness grasp my heart again. I have taken to exploring to avoid her blank gaze, traveling as far away as I can stand to be. I won't go far because one day I might not make it back. I leave again, but I want to know that she was still there like we promised.
Our neighbors sit permanently in front of their TV, dead long ago. Honestly, not much changed. They seem as nondescript now as they did before they disappeared. Sometimes I think I should have been a better neighbor and invited them out, but chances are they would have turned me down.
I sit in the car and consider turning on the radio before I realize it will be silent. Never will I hear new music again; I replay all the old tunes in my head even the ones I never liked. Is Queen still popular? If I like Queen and I'm the only one who is doing any liking, does that make them popular again? There's Bohemian Rhapsody again, but I don't remember the words.
I drive to the edge of town to the municipal lake. It has become a ritual. At least until I disappear too. I assume that one day I will disappear or die. I will waste away, but until then, I like to sit on a bench by the lake. I used to bring my family here on the weekends. We would swim, but no one swims anymore. We would barbeque, but I cannot remember the last time I had a meal. We would play tag, but it's not much fun playing tag with the cut-outs. We would watch the sunset, and I do this still. Alone. I am always alone here.
The sun sets, and I close my eyes, soaking in the last rays of light. There is warmth on my skin and in my heart. It is nice to feel so human…
There are fingers intertwined with mine. I open my eyes – Maggie. How long have we been in this awful yellow room? There are wires and cords attached to me everywhere. She smiles at me and runs her hands along my face. Amelia sits on the other side, smiling. And crying.
My voice rasps, ""Why are you crying, little love?"" I reach for my daughter's hand, the evening light hitting her golden locks and making her seem like my girl once more.
""I'm just glad to see you again, Dad.""
One blink. Then two. I recall a diagnosis, right before they all disappeared, but I struggle to remember the specifics. I forget a lot lately. ""How long have you been gone?""
Maggie leans in and looks concerned, ""We never left you. We were always right here."" Her voice cracks, ""I would never…""
I see them again, still in my life as beautiful as always but silent and unmoving. I smile at Maggie and squeeze her hand. ""Sorry, love. I must have forgotten.""
The girls share a look, but I close my eyes again. ""Let's watch the sunset together again like old times, okay?""
The sun begins to set with the most brilliant display of blues, purples, and pinks. Both girls hold my hands, and I smile. They are full of all the luster in the world. How could they have ever disappeared?
Finally, the sun dips below the horizon.
And I disappear.",0
"The Starship 'The Ship' had been surrounded. Resents were pouring in from every imaginable direction and the vessel was out of fuel. The two inhabitants of the ship were standing in the ship's cockpit. The large glass ceiling surrounding the room shook, as the Resents's ships pelted them with lasers, chairs, table lamps, and other assorted items that they found lying around, the majority of these 'weapons' had no effect but Resents were too stupid to realize that.
""So, this is it,"" the young, red-haired, girl asked as she stared at the shield's durability chart on one of the monitors in the room, ""Once the sheilds break down and something breaks the glass, we're done for.""
""Kid, what have I told you,"" the twenty-something aged man, who demanded to be called 'The Hero', asked, ""Whenever we get into a situation like this there is always a way ou --""
""But the self-destruct requires so much time to get to,"" she forcefully interrupted, ""We don't have the time! And besides, we'd still need to get to the escape pod first.""
""Then we'll just have to stall for time, get to work on opening the vaults to where the button is,"" The Hero said, sitting down in the captain's seat. Once settled down, he pulled down one of the monitors that hung above the seat and with it one of the microphones.
""What're you doing? Say something about us being spies?""
""No, I have a better idea that they can't prove."" He opened up the communications application on the monitor and searched through the 'nearby ships' option to find what he was looking for: the fleet's commanding ship.
Soon after beginning the transmission, the monitor's screen changed to showing a dark interior of a ship with a single, gooey grey figure on the other side. The Hero simply smiled as it began to talk. ""This Fleet Girelpish. Reetreet Nebulae, surrender or destroyed,"" the figure stated in a loud and booming voice. The threat, however, didn't appear to be all that serious to The Hero, mainly because of the figure's poor English and seemingly made up words.
""Hey, cool your jets, I'm The Hero and this is my partner The Kid,"" he tilted the monitor to the girl, who was busy plugging away at a screen on the side of the wall.
""Don't bring me into this,"" she glared for a moment before going back to opening the vault.
""We come in peace,"" The Hero continued, ""We were just passing through on the way to somewhere important.""
""You aware great war, correct,"" the Resent pieced together. Of course they knew of the great war, they were currently trying to get to a base within Resent territory that needed their help.
""Of course I know, it was a big risk coming all the way out here. But i'm not on the Galactic Federation's side or anything, i'm just trying to meet up with a friend.""
""Who that?""
""The commander of your entire species, the head honcho, the big guy. Y'know, your leader.""
""We're doomed,"" The Kid groaned, before going back to the task at hand.
""You want leader"" the Resent asked.
""Of course, we were going to have tea and biscuits,"" The Hero said, as if he wasn't pulling stuff out of his ass.
""Wait moment."" The Resent said, before seemingly dragging its body off screen.
The Hero took the moment to look back at The Kid, asking in a hurried voice, ""How much longer till you get the thing ready?""
""Gonna need another minute or two. Why did you think this would work?""
""Resents are incredibly stupid, that's why.""
""What is incredibly stupid,"" a new, more soothing, and more grammatically correct voice asked from behind The Hero. He turned around to see that a new figure, near identical to the one of the fleet's leader, had appeared on screen. Before The Hero could respond, the figure began to talk again, ""I am Rexeland, leader of the Reetreet Nebulae. You two must be the ones that have called us. Why have you demanded to speak with me?""
""Uhh,"" The Hero stuttered, internally debating whether Resents were *that* stupid, ""Well, um, uh, Rexeland, it's been awhile. Don't you remember? It's me, uh, Que-Gorp Slabseedap.""
""Slabseedap,"" Rexeland responded awestruck, ""Is that really you? You look so different.""
""Well, you know, with body transfers and vocal cord replacements, anyone can appear different nowadays,"" he said after a moment of silence caused by him realizing they are that stupid.
Rexeland's voice suddenly became darkened, troubled. ""So, do you still remember what happened? O--on, Panea?""
""Oh, uh, of course. How could I forget?"" The Hero had no idea what he was doing.
""The fleet commander, he said that you came to see me. D--Does this mean that you've forgiven me? Does this mean you still love me?""
""Hey, Hero,"" The Kid called from behind, ""It's open, should I press it now?""
""Yes, uh, of course!"" The Hero said to the image on the screen.
""Great,"" the Resent said, doing its equivalent of crying, ""Then the war is off! I'll call the Galactic Federation and tell them that it's ov --""
Rexeland's victorious outburst was cut short by a synthesized voice coming from The Ship, ""Self-Destruct sequence initiated. Please proceed to one of the available escape pods. Destruction of ship will begin in 60, 59, 58...""
All color drained from The Hero's face as the countdown continued. ""I'll, uh, i'll be right back."" This promise was subsequently followed by The Hero running away and screaming like a little girl, trying to catch up to The Kid who was already in an escape pod.
The pod departed through a small chunk of open space that the Resents had neglected cover. Their escape was soon followed by a large explosion originating from The Ship that claimed the lives of all the Resents in the area.
""What,"" The Kid asked as The Hero glared at her, ""You told me to press it.""
They rode the rest of the way to their destination in quiet.",0

"""Ruka-sama...I deeply regret this, but I'm the messenger. Not the sender"".
Asher's Japanese was...for a better word, *lacking*, so instead of continuing the explanation, he kneeled further down, reaching for the hem of Iwasaki-san's robe and wrapped the blood-soaked length of the blade in the rich, decadent fabric. Silk shushed thinly on the metal, its bright-rose hexagons, tsubaki and cranes turning a deep, thick shade of maroon.
It should've been kept pristine, to avoid obstruction. When Asher felt the blade to be sufficiently clean, he held his fingertip up to scrutiny, watching the angled piece of metal slide back into the carbonized phalange. With a series of clicks and hisses, his fist clenched and unclenched, testing the servo integrity.
Beneath him, Ruka Iwasaki was twitching, a mess of pale flesh thrown about the kimono drapings, hopelessly trying to crawl forward - blind, almost deaf, maimed beyond recognition. Bloodied and matted hair kept her visage mostly obscure from him, though a tell-tale string of maroon-tinted saliva stretch down, to the very mattress.
The woman's bare back pulsed with a swarm of raging dragons and koi carps, as she glitched, dripping blood, towards Asher. Towards her lost treasure, her pearls that Asher so savagely ripped out her now weeping meat. Now, bathed in the filtered, sliced-up light that seethed through the shoji, they lay scattered at the bed's footing, glistening - abandoned.
Asher ran a hand through them, picking out a cranial neuromodulator and gently wiping it over his suit.
""I'm afraid I'll have to take...these...back"", Asher moved the duffel bag closer to the *sukeban's* futon. With a practiced, trained-in efficiency, he began cleaning and putting her parts away. It was too silent and cold for him, so he had to talk, to break the ice somewhat, to show the girl some human connection through her ruinous misery. Ruka-sama couldn't speak anymore, afterall. Only tiny, animal noises signified some presence of life and cognition, the erratic grasping motions of her left, live hand.
Behind the sterile mask and safety glasses, Asher's narrow face folded into a frown, as part after part - a Heiwan forearm module with built-in, springloaded tanto, a BMW gastro-buxt hydraulics loop, a mil-grade glandular VX dispenser, on and on - was cleared from fluid and lowered into the bag. The Neon Orizuru put so much faith in Ruka-sama. She had that papercut edge they sought in new muscle, and lavished her beauty with expensive, lethal gifts.
Too bad, that she overestimated their significance. It was not what you could do with them, but for what purpose, and that was exactly what Ruka Iwasaki had forgotten. No power was limitless, and the still-bleeding gash on his own cheek was proof of that, in case his own pride will once whisper foolish promises into an eager ear.
""Mr. Orochi sends his condolescences"", Asher leaned in closer to her, his hard, ball-jointed thumb pushing through the dark tangle of Iwasaki-san's hair, into the hollow of her eye and cheek, clearing away tears. The words came out awkward and stiff.
The woman shuddered under his touch, sending haptic feedback all the way up his own reinforced periphery.
Ah, she grew lighter. Mindful of her frail state, of the asynchronic beat of Ruka-sama's heart, Asher slowly pushed an ornately embellished wakizashi that he previously pulled from the sukeban's own centerpiece stand, into the girl's remaining hand. And smiled, when he saw her fingers wrap around the handle. Strength was always commendable, circumstances be damned.",0

"All along the horizon the fires were burning, and still Harald knew that it was not enough. He found a tree and limped over to it, his sword still gripped in his once good hand, now covered in blood. The blade itself was battered and blunted, the sword had been used more like an ax than anything else, chopping and hacking through the crowds.
He fell onto the ground beneath the tree, his back resting against it's hard bark. In the distance, below the smoke and the fire trails, they were moving. Despite looking human they were something else, demons given solid form perhaps, but certainly not human. Certainly not alive. Certainly not dead.
Harald wanted to bound to his feet. He wanted to lift his sword yet again in a final embrace with death, but he could not. His arm wouldn't listen. His feet wouldnt so much as twitch, and deep down he knew, the end was upon him. Hell itself had come to Aengland, and all Harald could do was watch as it descended upon him.",0
"Janice turned to me, her big blue eyes still full of childish innocence. Damn - I'd forgotten that she was watching the Presidential Inauguration for a school project. ""Daddy,"" she began, ""what does the President mean? What's 'gay'?""
""Well, honey..."" I began, but trailed off as I tried to think of a way to explain it to a five year old. ""Uh...Well, you know how Mommy and Daddy like to hold hands, and to cuddle, and kiss, and stuff?""
""Yeah! It's funny when Mommy pinches your butt when you're not looking, and makes you squeak!"" she giggled. Kids, man - I'd forgotten what it was like to be so amused by the word ""butt"". Had I ever been that small, that innocent?
I waited for her giggles to subside before I carried on. ""Well, sweetheart, 'gay' means that he - the President - he likes to do that stuff with a boy, not a girl like Mommy.""
I could see the confusion in her eyes as she struggled to process this new information. Damn you, McCain, for making me explain this to her! She's not old enough for this; she's not ready! *I'M* not ready!
Janice opened her mouth to speak. I knew what was coming; I'd opened the door to a lifetime of sexual deviancy. My sweet little girl was gone forever.
Suddenly I realized she'd something, and in my worry, I'd completely missed it. ""Sorry, sweetheart - what did you say?"" I asked, fearing her response. What fresh hell have I unlocked?
""I said, I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie? Please, Daddy?""
I was stunned, unable to respond at first.
""Uhm. Sure,"" I answered. ""Get one for your brother, too.""
Huh. I guess that maybe what two consenting adults do behind closed doors isn't that big of a deal after all.

"######[] (#dropcap)
Gary Almond watched the sun set from the basket of a hot air balloon, all while enjoying the *Somewhere Over the Rainbow* on his magical Walkman.
Gifted to Gary by a mysterious hobo for buying him booze, the magical Walkman only played the soundtrack to Gary's life, as if it knew exactly what music he needed.
High above rolling green hills on his hot air balloon, IZ Kamakawiwo'ole's angelic voice melted Gary's worries away. Nothing could ruin this day, except perhaps his lifelong enemy Mortimer Splanket. Fuck that guy.
It is at this point the magical Walkman abruptly cut off the peaceful song and began to play John Williams's *Duel of the Fates*.
Gary was startled into a heightened state of alertness. The Walkman had never failed him. He scanned the horizon. Something was about to happen and Gary couldn't find the source of danger.
In the distance, a yellow biplane sped towards Gary's balloon. Gary knew what this was. ""Splanket!"" he shook his fist.
Indeed, it was Mortimer Splanket on a stolen crop duster here to kill Gary once and for all. Splanket climbed out of the cockpit seat as he approached the hot air balloon. He had no plan; just rage. ""ALMOND!!"" He leapt out of the biplane onto the balloon. One of the plane's wings clipped the balloon, tearing a large gash into the fabric. Splanket began to slide down one of the ropes.
The soundtrack on Gary's magical Walkman reached its first peak as Splanket slid into the basket. The two slugged it out to the intense choir of *Duel of the Fates*, both of them ignoring that the fact that they were falling out of the sky.
Punch after brutal punch; neither had the upper hand. The basket began to spin around the wilting balloon, and the centripetal force pushed them to the floor of the basket. Splanket wrapped his elbow around Gary's neck. Gary was about to pass out.
Without warning, the hot air balloon crashed on top of a speeding train. Gary was sent flying into the space between two cars. His face was inches from the blurring tracks when he caught himself on the train joints holding the two cars together. Gary tried to pull himself up with his free arm, but the fall had dislocated his shoulder. Luckily, the headphones were still secure on his head. He didn't want to have a fight to the death without *Duel of the Fates*.
Meanwhile, Splanket was stuck in the basket as it dragged next to the wheels of the train. Bloodied and dazed from the impact, he searched for any decent handhold before the basket was sucked under the wheels. The balloon was tearing and Splanket's ground was slipping from underfoot. He grabbed a corner at the end of one train car and saw Gary in the gap behind it.
""Almond!""
""Splanket!"" Still in danger of falling between the cars, Gary used one leg to kick at Splinket to the horns of John Williams's orchestra.
The balloon finally tore to shreds, and both the basket and burner slipped away. Splinket held onto the train with both feet dragging beside the track.
The hot air balloon's burner was crushed by one of the wheels several cars back. The ensuing explosion derailed one car just as *Duel of the Fates* hit another peak. Gary propped himself with his legs and raised the volume on his magical Walkman with his one good arm. He loved how spot-on it was at capturing the moment.
The derailed car behind them began to topple other cars one by one.
Splanket found footing and climbed into the gap. Standing between the two cars, he stomped on Gary's hand.
Gary fell further down and his dislocated arm grazed the track's crossbeams.
Splanket moved down to try to kick Gary completely off. Fortunately for Gary, one of the kicks to his shoulder snapped the dislocated socket back into place.
Now free to use both arms, Gary pulled on Splanket's leg. Splanket slipped and landed on his crotch, ending up with the train joints between his legs.
The derailment finally reached the car to one side of them. It began to twist in place and one its wheels lifted off the rail.
Just as the score was reaching its crescendo, Gary pulled the latch pin on the train joint and used it like brass knuckles to beat on Splanket.
With the trains unhooked, the cars began to separate. Splanket was now too far for Gary to punch. The two men stared at each other as they drifted apart.
Splanket felt a little defeated as the car he was on started to topple. ""Punk ass bitch!""
""Tuck and roll, shit stain!"" replied Gary.
Tuck and roll he did.
Gary stood at the end of the train, bruised and bleeding. As he looked back at the tumbling cars, *Duel of the Fates* faded back into *Somewhere Over the Rainbow* at the wonderful view. Gary wondered how long until the next time they meet.",0
"At night, when everything is dark and silent,
The men will stalk their prey within the woods.
With weapons drawn and tempest minds yet violent
They wait and hide in cloaks and capes and hoods.

For with each shadowed step the monster takes
The men will spring to action in defense.
They slash and fight until the ground but quakes;
They shed their blood, protect the innocents.

And when the sunlight rises o're the trees,
The men will wash and then return to home.
Their children play wherever they do please
But in the darkness, something new will roam.

"""Ok, everyone. I'll be reading a brief statement and I ask that you please hold all of your questions until the end. As you may know, the President was scheduled to make a stop in Arizona this morning to meet with Governor Brewer. Afterwards, he took the motorcade south to visit the border area and meet with guards. And I'm afraid to report that there was a serious accident on the way, and the President has died.""
*Cameras click, reporters shout questions, and the Press Secretary holds up his hand to try to quiet them down. *
""As best we can determine, the driver for the president's limousine in Arizona was not properly vetted with the Secret Service. Or there was some sort of mix-up and the President was put into the wrong vehicle; we're still trying to establish exactly what went wrong and how this individual ended up at the wheel. Based on recordings from the driver seat, this individual seemed to be harboring a deep grudge against some of the wildlife in Arizona's nature preserves. He did not directly threaten the President, but instead went off the road in an attempt to kill birds native to the area. We are also looking into the possibility that he was experiencing hallucinations: at one point, he mentions following a bird into a tunnel, followed shortly by the sounds of a loud impact that match with hitting a wall or some other solid object. The recording also captures a 'meep meep' sound that may be another driver's horn. We are still trying to locate this potential witness.""
*Reporters again try to interject with questions. The Press Secretary continues reading*.
""The President and this madman both survived that initial impact, as far as we can determine. In the recording, you can hear the President in the back seat, demanding to know why the driver is strapping missiles to the limousine. The driver only grumbles in response. As best we can tell, the driver then activated these rockets, sending the car careening through the desert and straight over a sheer cliff, plummeting straight into the canyon below. Beyond the wreckage of the car, the only evidence found at the scene was a wooden placard reading ""Oops!""
*More questions are shouted. *
""Finally, the American people should be reassured that this is not part of a larger terror plot. This 'Wile E. Coyote' was a lone wolf, acting alone. However, his credit card bills indicate that he regularly purchased dangerous weapons and traps, though those items have not been located. We are investigating his ties to a potential illicit arms smuggling ring connected to the Acme Corporation, which is known to supply North Korea with weapons and equipment.""",0
"""Been a while, hasn't it?""
Jesus. Was that the best I could do? I'd had ten years to think up a line and *that* was it?
Ah well. The reaction was still the same, thankfully. Open mouths. Stares of shock. Someone dropping a glass. All as I'd hoped.
""Matt, man? Fuck, we thought you were dead, dude,"" said Jimmy. Not the smartest around, Jimmy. You'd see brighter sparks on the end of the toke perpetually dangling from his lips.
""So did I, to be honest. You know how long I was in those ruins? Or have you forgotten already?""
Sam cut me off. ""Come on, man, don't be like this. We thought you were --""
""Going to die? Is that what you were going to say?""
""But that poison...That was guaranteed to kill you!""
""Thanks for the reminder, Charlie. I noticed as I was writhing in agony.""
Damn it. Even after all those practices, I couldn't hide how bitter I was. Cold and detached, Matt. You got this. Time to play your trump card.
""I wonder exactly how you knew that, Charlie. Could it be because of this?"" I pulled the glass bottle from my pocket. Charlie's eyes widened, though whether it was with fear or realisation I couldn't tell.
""It wasn't the dart in the temple that had poison in it, was it, Charlie? It was the soup you oh-so-lovingly made for me. Wasn't it?""
Charlie couldn't talk. He was clutching his throat. As were Sam and Jimmy, actually.
""The soup you all made together to help a friend in need, yes?""
Tears were streaming down their faces now.
""In any case, I decided to repay your *gratitude* with a present. Mixed into the beer you all just drained.""
Charlie had already collapsed, the bastard. Jimmy and Sam were still hanging on, though.
""You should have invited me to the reunion.""
Not sure why I said that. No one was left to hear it. Maybe it was just for therapeutic purposes. After all...
Ten years with the knowledge your best friends tried to kill you doesn't exactly help the anger management.",0
"""I'm so sorry, she didn't make it through the night."" I never knew how powerful words could be. How ridiculously terrible. How they can completely destroy someone's life. 7 words determining how the years to come will be for someone. I wonder how they feel while they wait for us to come up to them. While they sit on those little benches stapled to the wall or crammed in those tiny rooms around a rumpled bed. Or even standing in a hallway endlessly pacing back and forth, like they're trying to carve their fear and worry into the tiled floor.
I was going to stay with her all night you know? But that's not how how it works. Someone else needs the bed. Maybe someone who still has a chance or maybe someone who's just going to be carted down like this poor girl. I stayed with her until they came to take her downstairs though. Everyone else had left. I guess I just didn't want to accept what happened. I mean, I became a doctor to help people. Here's the non-living proof that I had failed. Ha! Get it? Non-living! Gallows humor, I guess.
How did everyone find the strength to go on? I'm so drained and it's only 1 am. Still have another 7 hours on the clock. When they came to roll her body out, I looked at the black bag and wondered, ""Why do we do that?"" Cover them up so we can't see the person anymore. It's like they never existed. All that's left is a misshapen black bag with a serial number. The orderly had headphones in and tossed her inside the bag without any ceremony. Didn't she deserve better? A solemn moment? Not a twenty-something head banger treating her like cargo to be rolled around.
They called the family shortly after she was rolled out. They were on their way right after the call. A pre-funeral procession. I was left with the task of telling them what happened. She was my patient after all. My attending thought it was time I had one of these conversations. Hooray. No more safety net. Sink or swim...sink or swim. It kind of felt like that, like I was drowning. It was suddenly hard to breathe and I felt the panic rising in my chest. How was I so sweaty all of a sudden?
I didn't get long to stew in this medley of terror. One of the nurses at the station nearby let me know the family was downstairs, waiting in the hall on the first floor. So I took that eternal elevator ride from the third to the first floor. Hoping it would have a malfunction. Then I'd be spared the task of having to tell them this news. It was weighing me down like Atlas' great burden and crushing my spirit. But the doors opened and I stepped out, looking quite the ""professional"" in my crumpled scrubs and messed up hair.
This memory will be forever fixed in my mind. I turn to the right and see the family, the dad pacing and the mom clutching the two younger siblings tight to her chest. They look at me and I see something that breaks my heart. I see their eyes and I see in them the deluded hope that what they heard on the phone was a mistake, an error that the good doctor is here to correct. How can they not realize that I'm about to pass to them the most Herculean of burdens? They carefully study my face and when they see what's behind it, a part of them dies. Their hope blinding and then gone in a fleeting moment, like a dying star in the night sky. Their eyes water, the mom hugging her kids even tighter as though her grasp is a shield protecting them from the truth. The dad clenching his fists so tight, they start to turn as white as the bone within them. Their hope is gone and I open my mouth to say ""I'm so sorry, she didn't make it through the night.""",0
"""This is seriously how you decide who gets omnipotent power? Like this isn't some shitty joke you play on mortals for kicks?"" I asked the man in the white robe in front of me. He had just finished up the Bruce Almighty routine before I could even ask about his authenticity.
""Yes, there's simply no way around it I'm afraid, my child."" He replied, His words, while quiet, were confident and soothing.
""So you just pulled two random people from the globe to compete for their newly granted powers? This competition is ridiculous! You look so stereotypical and this is the random type of bullshit you come up with? You've got the robe, the beard, the staff, the sandals, fucking sandals..."" I broke off incredulously.
""Your opponent has already agreed to the terms and rules of this challenge. Son, I made you for this, accept this challenge and compete to replace me as God. Accept this and accept your destiny."" He Spoke to me, his words coming out as a whisper yet hitting me harder than bricks.
My palms clammy, and stomach heavy I looked up to meet his eyes. They met mine, holding care and hopeful longing. ""I accept"" I replied, as excitement and relief swept over his features.
""Amazing"" he said clapping his hands together "", as of now the competition has started, first person who shits will lose. I wish you the best of luck."" He said before disappearing.",0
"I sat down and let the chair absorb my full weight, a feeling I knew meant I was out for the count, and took out a cigarette. The air felt nice, though. Why did I have to mix whiskey and...""Alex?"" The person sitting across called my name, unsure if she got it right. I smiled in assurance that she did. She sort of looks like Jessica in this light.
""Are you feeling okay?"" I asked. I saw that drink change his demeanor from jumpy to ready for bed. The party just started, there were still people coming. ""Yeah, thanks, I'll be okay in a minute,"" he laughed. He's cute.
""Hey,"" I nudged my friend, ""think she's taken?"" and jerked my eyes to the direction of the girl that was talking just talking. Joey turned his neck to me, then to her, then back to his cigarette.
""Who cares man, not like she'll care if you talk to her."" ""You got a point."" ""Joey, you got a lighter?"" I patted my pockets looking for my missing lighter.
""I have it, my bad."" I went over to light Alex's cigarette and handed it back to Joey. ""It's chilly."" I let out a pop and the permeating smell brought Andy and his friend over to the table.
Don't do it Alex. Don't take a hit. You're already fucked up, look I'm giving myself directions. Just pass it along, there you go. I looked into the house from the balcony and saw some new people coming in. ""Fuck.""
I opened the front door and to my happy surprise I saw Rachel. ""Jessica!!"" I gave her a big hug, and in a hushed tone she let me know Alex was here. I looked around and saw him looking my way.

Eh it was fun writing",0
"A friend of mine said it was something like a mushroom trip or a lucid dream, and you had to skip a night of sleep for it to work. I had skipped the night of sleep like they said I needed to, truth be told, I had skipped two nights. With the help of Starbucks I was still up. We drove up to his dad's cabin. They were cheering and pushing me up towards the door. My friend came in the cabin with me, where it was pitch black, save for two candles. The walls were draped with black felt, so it felt like we stood in the black of space. Up above the candles there was a large mirror, and beneath it, closer to us, was a recliner. Here it was quiet, here it was warm, here was another place.
I took my place in the recliner, my friend sat somewhere unseen behind me. He told me to stare into the mirror and instructed me to keep speaking, and not to stop. It started out pretty innocuous, the candles were very dim, even for candles, so i couldn't see anything in the mirror, except for the candle's reflection in my own eyes, tiny glittering lights dancing in the dark. I mentioned that, how profoundly comfortable the chair was, and how I could hear his pencil on the paper. Focusing on the tiny twin glints of light in the mirror, my voice became more distant, as if far away in a tunnel, the sound of my friend's writing was not noticeable, and even the chair felt like it had fallen away, and I was floating in the black nothingness of space. Even the aches of sleep deprivation had evaporated somewhere else. The universe consisted of me, the darkness, and the light, they were singular now.
---
The light, it was the light, the light people always talk about. The light was the light at the end of the tunnel, the proverbial light for the dead. It took what felt like hours, but it was much nearer now, nearly engulfing me. My grandmother was here, her warm smile, now years vacant from my life. Its warmth filled me with relief and contentment I had not known for too long. Her son, my uncle, was there too. Everyone gone was there, and they welcomed me warmly, and with love. as I approached, they walked backwards, beckoning me into the light. Clouds rolled at their feet, I walked on a path of golden light cut through it. I approached and they retreated towards the light, facing me.
When There was only enough darkness left to see them, I was finally able to draw near them. I was able to hug my grandma. She was exactly as I remembered her. I was relaxation, I was contentment. In this moment of bliss I felt her pull at me with all her strength, suddenly, and with vigor, she pushed herself away from me, I remained motionless, she could not move me. I was confused. The warmth in her eyes was gone, I was about to say something when my uncle grabbed my wrist and pulled as hard as he seemed able to. Again I didn't budge, my arm didn't even move. The departed relatives looked at each other with bafflement, I grabbed my uncle's wrist and pulled him to the golden path, the ray of light I walked on. From the bottom of his legs protruded not feet, but trunks, extending downwards, then back, back into the light. I felt my uncle's wrist crumple like an empty canvas bag or a glove, his image shot up off the image in front of me to reveal a mess of glowing golden roots entwined around splinters of what was once a skeleton, all of them pouring into the skull. through the eyes, through the mouth, through the nose. they shook themselves free of all the bones but the skull, and the Skull, now the terminus of a trunk reading out from the light wrapped around me and pulled with what I could only describe as the strength of a god. Still, I did not budge.
My friend was bent over me shining a light in my face. I was covered in water and the lights were on. ""That was important work champ, we know where to find them now"" He stuck a needle in my neck, Next time I woke I found myself at home in my bed. None of my other friends ever saw him again, and when we went out to see where the cabin was, it had burnt down. I was, however, able to find some shards of a broken mirror, and two candle holders amongst the ash.",0

It had been a long day. He knew what was coming, yet he still had to do his job. He stared out at the waiting sea, a nearby lighthouse brightening the area for a second, before continuing out to sea. He lit up his third cigarette, in what seemed like the last ten minutes standing on the shore. He wanted to delay as long as possible, but it was inevitable.
& nbsp;
Sucking deep on his cigarette, he cast the spell that allowed the beacon to appear. He had chosen a green triangle, a small dash removed near the top on one of the lines. It was his mark, and a completed triangle usually meant a trap. Something that forced him to cast the beacon unwillingly. The other five guardians knew that.
& nbsp;
The next five minutes were unbearable. He looked out over the water for what was coming, but time seemed to draw on longer and longer the more he waited. After ten minutes, he was ready to give up and walk away. The beacon was set, they must have seen it, he could just-
& nbsp;
""SCREEEEEE!"" The sound that came from over the horizon was horrifying to say the least. But he knew that high pitched noise from anywhere. She was coming. He looked over the ocean carefully, and saw it. The small animals figure grew larger and larger as it got closer and closer. The creatures large feet patting against the surface of the water as it ran, like it was running on solid ground.
& nbsp;
There was still time. He could run. She may not have seen him yet. ""PETROVAAAAAA!"" the rabbit-like creature called as it neared the beach. It was over. He was done for. The rabbit collided into Petrova, knocking him to the ground, both tumbling around each other like until they hit a rock a few metres back from the collision site.
& nbsp;
""Hello, Lily."" He grunted, trying to show as much disappointment to see her as he could. She snuggled her head up on his chest and wrapped her arms around him, trying to get in closer than physics allowed.
& nbsp;
""Petrova! It's been so long! I thought we'd never see each other again! How have you been? Did you learn some new magic? Ooh, I got myself an apprentice! You should really get one too. We need to have six guardians, and if something happened to you, oh I can't bear the thought."" While Lily prattled on, barely taking a breath between each sentence, Petrova pushed her off and got to his feet. He pulled out a new cigarette and lit it.
""Come on, we have to move to the second point."" Lily stopped talking for a second.
""Second point? How many Guardians are you summoning?""
""All of them.""
""Come on Petrova, stop being gruff for one second and tell me honestly. How many are we really summoning?"" Petrova finished his cigarette and turned to Lily.
""I'm a goat. We are meant to be gruff. And we need the whole council on this one.""
""Why? What's happening?""
""The Bull is back.""",0
"I'm sitting opposite a man. Someone who I had never met before in person but who's life I have memorized in its totality. My childhood has always been rather hazy, so I feel as though I've supplemented it with pictures of happiness found in the old, meticulous diary entries of the individual before me. It isn't the first time I've done this. The only way to get someone to talk is to truly become the them. Truth is as relative as the universe in which it has been conceived and I for one have created a very relative universe for myself.
""Blink once for a yes and twice for a no, do you understand?""
'Blink'
The white walls of the eight by ten room had recently really started to take a toll on me, but they served a purpose. There was a certain spaceless quality it imbued that allowed me to pull the mark out of the real world, and into one of my own creation.
""Now, I am going to show you a short clip. You will not like the contents of this video. You are to watch the whole thing and will not close your eyes or look away for it's duration. Is this also understood?""
A pair of piercing blue eyes stared back defiantly. The man to whom they belonged sat in an uncomfortable looking slouch. His balding head seemed to be attracted to his left shoulder, mirroring the way his penis rested on his left testicle. He looked retched. The bruising on his shoulders and chest told a story of the failed attempts of amateurs, trying to make him talk. I know this ploy, I don't like using words and speak only for my job. This is a luxury i enjoy utilizing. I am an artist and my work is performed always for an audience of one.
""Your compliance is unnecessary to me. I merely ask it of you in order to allow this process to go on in a reasonably amicable fashion. If you do not want to follow my instructions, this sharp blade can produce the same effect. I find the removal of eyelids to be a dreadfully tedious task. I'll take your response to be yes and continue.""
At the end of the day this was all foreplay. Once the video came on he would not be able to avert his gaze. I pressed the play button and sat back in my chair.
metron
Onto the screen flashed a distorted image of a dining room. In the middle of it was a grand mahogany table, all around which were seated three people. The group consisted of a women and two small children; a boy and a girl. When he saw this the man's eyes widened in fear. How could I know who these people were? How could I know of their existence? Who they were is of no relevance to me. It was sufficient that they inspired the reaction that I received. I was told that the man was a loner with no affiliation. It seems the people who told me this were wrong.
In the centre of the table was a metronome slowly ticking back and forth. It was going at a rather steady pace. ""Tack, tick, Tack, tick."" Along with that there was a slow chant just barely audible.
""Tell, him, Tell, him...""
The man's eyes were saucers. I must admit the image was really quite striking. Each of my participants were alternatively striking the table with each word. You could visibly hear his pulse as the pace of the metronome started to quicken. I had really outdone myself on the aesthetic.
'Crack'.
The sound of a head kissing mahogany. The woman had stopped here movements. The young children were visibly distressed and started to make their way around the table to her. Shit, this was not supposed to happen. How the fuck was I to know that she had so few words left. God fucking dammit. I should have fucking known.
""PHTHWAK!""
The much louder sound of a man hitting the floor. I spun around to see two lifeless eyes staring back at me. Did he fucking say something? Shit I must have missed it during the commotion of the video. I've got to check the tape, what the fuck did he say.
I run out of the door and into my equipment room where the tape is still rolling. Rewind, rewind, rewind, fucking play.
The audio comes on and there is the unmistakable sound of the first crack of head meets table. I focus the sound and turn it up. I tiny rasp echo's in my ears as its amplified to gargantuan proportions...
""Soon"".",0
"*Crack*. A large section of an old wall came crashing down. Dust and debris flew everywhere, a beam of water sprouted from somewhere, and yelling could be heard coming from upstairs.
‘ What the hell is going on down there? Phil? PHIL? Are you okay? ’
Phil shook his head, coughed a few times, patted his limbs, checking whether they were all there, and made his way towards the stairs. A loud ringing noise filled his ears.
‘ Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, fine, nothing to worry about. It's just a piece of old— ‘
He fell silent, as he saw something amidst the mist of dust. A faint green light, blinking slowly, irregularly. Phil took out his flashlight from his utility belt and flipped the ‘ on'switch. No light.
‘ Goddamn batteries. Should have bought the top brand. Where are the spare— ‘
‘ PHIL! Do I need to come down there?'interrupted the voice from upstairs.
‘ No no, it's okay. It's just, the flashlight. Its, uhm, batteries— ‘
Phil looked at the light again. It had started to blink more rapidly, and appeared to have moved a bit towards him. He felt the urge to meet it halfway, as if it was a love long lost, with who he finally reunited with. *Hug me, want me, kiss me, so close now, yes, almost, here, please, yes, YES, YEEESSS!!! *
* * * * *
Phil regained consciousness, and Matt was standing over him. His mouth moved, but Phil heard no words, just the ringing sound. It had not faded. Phil never noticed it before, but Matt only had one green eye. *Curious, looks good on him though. Mysterious. Goes great with his fingers. Always liked that tentacle look, bet his wife appreciates the possibilities too. *
Slowly sound came back to Phil, and he could make out what Matt was saying.
‘ Nakz-hal retk-ii. Nakz-hal retk-ii! NAKZ!! NAKZ!!! ’
Matt's eye had started to shine, like a blinking star. Bright green. First slowly, then rapidly.
Phil looked down at his body, and wondered where his legs went.",0

"It had happened again. I woke up in a blank white room with an almost faceless man, I mean he must have had a face, its just that I couldn't make it out...I don't know why this felt so familiar.
Before my mind could wonder, he began as he always did.
""How do you feel right now?""
""Fine"" I replied. By this point I knew there was no point in asking questions. He would ask his questions and then...I don't know what happened after that. I mean I vaguely remembered bits and pieces of...
""Do you know why you are here?"" the interviewer interrupted my train of thought.
""No...wait...I- I did something..."" I struggled to remember why I was here, what I had done to get here, where here was even, but before I could make sense of it he began with his next question.
""What does it mean to be a good person?""
""What does it mean to be a bad person?""
""Are you a good person or a bad person?""
""How can you be a better person?""
The interviewer rattled his questions off and I answered them as best I could. I had trouble following him most the time and I am sure my answers came out incoherent at best. It was this place...My mind seemed...almost in a daze as if waking up on an operating room table staring into the light. Nothing quite made sense, yet it seemed like it was as it should be.
At a point the questions stopped and it seemed he was lecturing me on kindness and caring. As the lecture continued my world became fuzzier, and I more disoriented. As I began to lose myself in a void of unconscious confusion the world seemed to disappear in a flash.
It had happened again. I woke up in a blank room with a faceless man. It felt so familiar...
""How do you feel right now?""",0
"Anna had a habit of kissing me on the forehead.
When my mother died I'd feel a tingle down my spine when she did it. It had only been weeks since we started dating and her soft lips felt taboo against the particular patch of skin she rested them upon. The loud smack of her lips would pull me out of that hospital room where my mom coughed up her cancer for the last time and planted me firmly in the moment, where everything was quiet and Anna's hands would thumb away the tears that had no more reason to leak. I couldn't help but perk my lips upward, voluntarily forgetting the pain that felt so far away, shy and vulnerable in those moments. Everything was okay.
It was years later and it was dark. There was a blackout in my neighborhood so I decided to leave my apartment and head over to Anna's a couple blocks away to surprise her. The walk was longer and windier than usual. It broke me down, out of breath and weary. The wind whistled with increased violence as I stopped to catch my breath. I fought against it, indifferently and ignorantly and a million other adjectives apt to break me down foolish.
I climbed the stairs to where a pajamaed neighbor was standing outside her door. He looked mad with resent. Confusion left when I reached the door, and all sound was snuffed by a harrowing ring. I heard a glimpse of something, uncanny and out of place like a nightmare as my mind tried to rationalize it. I didn't hear what the man said, but it sounded like he was yelling for them to shut up. Them. I held composure, trying to force a relatable nod and smirk towards the man as he rolled his eyes at me and slammed back into his door. The screams were a grenade to my nerves. Cognitive dissonance was short lived. My stomach emptied its insides into my knees, buckling them together and collapsing them under the weight. Pulsing, timely, thumps like some sickly metronome conducted her ""yes's"" and ""oh yeah's,"" and ""fuck me's."" Soon the whole apartment block seemed to leave their doors, some parents covering their sheepish children's ears, talking amongst themselves in disgust. And they all stared at me, collapsed on top the face of her door, trying to pull back tears with my hands like scooping up air. I ended up banging them against the ground, as my mind bled into involuntary, broken moments. The ringing came again like an aftershock, attempting to immune me from the pain. Another neighbor walked towards the door set on saying something to me. I ran.
I ran back home. I turned to my kitchen knives and took the tallest, sharpest one out. I looked down at past scars, knife aimed down at them ready to split them open once again. I started to think about my mother, and the days before her death when she would pull my arm out of my sleeve and begin to cry. I started to think about Anna crying into them, madly kissing my forehead as her tears buckled against her lips and trickled down my arms, stinging them.
I started to think about Anna.
Anna.
I wanted to split them open. I wanted to split myself open and rip out all the invisible memories that ravaged me alone and insecure, malevolently hopeless. I wanted to rip something away from me. I wanted to rip away the past and start over. I wanted to rip something.
I woke up with my scars intact and knife in hand. I didn't remember going to sleep.
There was a knock on my door. I opened it and it was Anna.
The unnoticed knife nodded in my trembled fingertips.
She looked bright and cheerful. Fresh with a bow, like a polished porcelain doll, pristine and lack of fingerprint.
She grabbed my cheek. Her fingers were rough against it as it was numb against her. Her half smile rang through my spine and paralyzed me with hesitation. I couldn't hold back my lips as they turned upwards, trained like a dog. I dropped the knife, and its thud went unnoticed.
I started to think about my mother as she kissed me on the forehead.",0
"I know my roommate pretty well. Well, I guess ""knew him"", rather since he convincingly killed me and left me for dead without me seeing it coming at all. He only buried me about 3 feet deep. Huge mistake on his part. He even dug my ""grave"" with a gardening shovel. A spade? Would have been faster to actually stop somewhere and get a real shovel. He was really unprepared for this.
So it's a rushed job (he didn't even do a thorough checking of my vitals). So either it was a very emotionally motivated crime, or he was put up to it very ""on the spot"". Regardless, when I see him again I'll have to anticipate a very emotional and instinctual reaction.
Two days later, once I've made the proper arrangements, he walks into the same apartment in which we've shared beer and pizza; that he, hours later, dragged out my ""not-quite-a-corpse"" rolled into our living room rug. His keys drop to the ground as he stares in total shock in the doorway.
""How?"" the roommate says softly and very slowly.
I laugh.
""I'm laughing because you've dropped your keys on the floor again, and in 3..2..""
The Roomba turns on, and as though it were malicious intent goes towards the keys and vacuums them up.
""Listen"" I say as I slowly swirl my scotch in its' glass on a couch that we both pay for. ""I don't know exactly why you did what you did. Frankly I don't care, nor do I foster any resentment. You should know though, the game is on.""
I shut the hall light off, walk to my room, and call it a night. Well, I peak my head back out my door at him to say ""Abandon all routine or this will be way too easy"". I go to sleep. The game is on.",0
"When he returns from the mission, he tells the official version of his story so many times that he starts to believe it. He's on talk shows. He's on webcasts. He does guest appearances at sporting events and sees himself wave and smile on a screen two hundred feet tall, but he cannot recognize his own face. He thinks of this again when his visits his mother so she can play for him the recording of his first national appearance.
A clip of him shaking hands with the president plays silently on a loop from a frame by her front door. She says how proud she is of him and fills their time by playing the clips again and again and discussing her favorite parts. Here, she says, the way you nod, see? Everyone knows how brave you are. How strong. She sends copies of her highlight reel to her friends and siblings and he is inundated with emails and voicemail and missed video calls. We love you, they say. You make us proud.
At home, there is a regimen to take his mind off the lying and the mission and all the things from before the mission that still bubble up in public places and force him into bathroom stalls to throw up or weep against tile floors covered with piss. He does yoga in the morning. He meditates to the sound of monks chanting near the sea. He uses the VR sets that tech companies sent to him for free to wander a virtual copy of the moon in big leaping bounds. He finds a crater and stares back at the Earth and watches storms swirl across her surface as she spins through blackness. He tires the breathing exercises. He takes two pills in the morning with food, two at midday with plenty of water, and just one, dark blue pill before bed. He never remembers his dreams, but often wakes to find himself covered in sweat.
At his mother's house, he watches himself sit across from an aged Katie Couric, who at ninety looks sixty and still somewhat beautiful for an older woman. She's had treatments, sure, but doesn't looks as artificial and taught as the pop stars of his youth who are still singing about what boys and girls do when there's no one around to see. Her voice has never changed and she seems to be peering into his soul when they cut to her. ""Tell us,"" she says from the television, ""about the first minutes after the crash. What were you thinking? Feeling? What did you see?""
""Uh,"" he sees himself say. He half-smiles and runs a nervous hand through his hair. ""We went through north of containment,"" he says. The picture cuts away to a detailed map of the Zone 6 and zooms in on the east side. Two computer generated Stallions fly over the terrain. ""It was dark,"" he says. ""It's always dark there. Dark like it is just after the sun sets completely and there is still some light on the horizon."" He watches as the Stallions twist through a canyon and remember what it felt like to go through containment, like he ripped through an invisible bubble with his bare hands. They said, when got there, before the mission, that engineers carried the whole FOB piecemeal through gaps in containment. It took years, they said.
His mother fast-forwards the tape. This good part is coming up, she says as if he hasn't seen it several dozen times. The shots cut from Katie to him, him to Katie, back to the map and the animation. She resumes it as one of the Stallions clips a rock ledge and crashes into the snow at the base of a long canyon. ""What was going through your mind then?""
He shook his head on the screen and in real life. ""Not much,"" he said with a kind of reserved smile they had made him practice. ""You don't think, your training takes over. As soon as Oscar 2-2 hit that cliff, we dropped about 50 meters straight down and I was on the ground before I really had time to think.""
""And what did you see?"" Katie says.
He swallows. He watches as his tongue comes out to moisturize his lips. ""Well, a lot of my friend were already dead,"" he says. ""A lot of them were dying, but some of them were trying to get up. That's when we heard the first shots.""
""And where did those shots come from?""
""I didn't know,"" he says, but he did know. A guy named Martin or Martinez or something had opened fire from behind him. At first, he fired blindly into the air. He was trying to get his mask off with the other hand. He was screaming something, but the machine gun was tearing the air all around them. Another man, Jackson, took a grenade from his belt, pulled the pin, and rushed aimlessly away from the Stallion. He was chanting something in a language no one had heard and no one knew. He exploded several yards from the second Stallion, crippling one of the engines which began to burn. The pilots bailed, ran a few meters from the Stallion, then pulled their sidearms and shot each other without a word.
""What did you do?"" Katie says.
Here, his mother says, this is the best part.
In the video, he looks at the camera. His eyes are wet. ""I did what I had to do,"" he says. ""I did my job.""
His mother claps her hands together. That is my son, she says like she is seeing it for the first time.
""I ran to the downed Stallion and found Cooper and Estrada. She still had her mask on,"" he says.
""And by she, you mean Corporal Estrada?""
""Yes,"" he says. ""She had a broken leg, but she was firing into the cliff side. That's the first time I saw them. I carried Cooper out first. He was unconscious and bleeding from his wounds and needed evac, which was already on its way."" On the screen, he pauses and half smiles again. ""All of this is happening, not like a movie, but at the same time, each piece of information has the same weight, you know?""
Katie nods. ""It was confusing,"" she says. ""Scary.""
""Yes,"" he says and wipes at his eyes.
""We're going to cut away for a minute,"" Katie says, ""but we'll be back with-""
His mother fast forwards again. I'll skip this, she says.
They have given him yellow pills and he fishes one out of the bottle in his pocket as several advertisements blur past. He pops one and swallows it dry. It tastes the way he thinks mustard gas tastes, dusty and sour and full of slow death. It bubbles in his stomach. I think I need to get going, he says.
Just stay, his mother says, for this last part.
I've seen it, he says.
Please, she says. Just stay.",0
"David Poke woke up and looked out his blob. It used to be a window, but now it was some kind of shape that he didn't know the name of nor cared to learn. He rolled out of what wasn't his bed anymore, and walked through something that could've been a house once, if you used your imagination.
David tried to open a rhombus of serial, but his arms were on both sides of what kind of looks like a body, if you turn your head a little and squint your eyes. This made it exceedingly difficult to eat. Fortunately, David, as well as the rest of post-humanity, didn't feel all that hungry anymore.
The Catartstrophe happened about a week ago. No one really understood it at first, but then again, they didn't really understand anything anymore.
This is what happened. Some shmuck with a BA in Art History realized she didn't have any marketable skills, so she when she graduated with a B- average from her safety school, she had little hope of finding anything resembling a job. Upon returning home, she was met with a litany of ""told-ya-sos"" by everyone in her family, including the dog who learned to talk solely to mock her life choices.
Distraught, but still convinced her opinions worthy of respect, the fucking moron went on a dark pilgrimage through the world, telling everyone of her brilliant socialist ideas that ""totally worked in Sweden, you guys. Seriously.""
From country to country, city to city she roamed. Each port of call she fell upon presented her with the existential dread of this certainty: reality was real, and one cared if she was triggered or not. She was laughed out of the Louvre. Mocked in the MOMA. Giggled at in the Gugenheim. Every place she went, no one respected her knowledge! *Inapplicable! * was cried.
*Seriously, get a real job! I think Bed Bath and Beyond is hiring. You get benefits if you work more than 35 hours a week, too! *
*Would you shut up, for fuck's sake? Christ! It's Jackson Pollock. My kid does this on the back of a Denny's activity sheet. *
How she gnashed her perfect, porcelain teeth and how she ripped at her unwashed, dreadlocked hair! How she screamed and howled when, finally, the indifference and stubbornness of the world finally broke her! Like Krakatoa her soul erupted and split in two! The anguished roar echoed in the four corners of the world...
She walked through the desert, seeking the sweet embrace of death. Within a cave she came to rest and wait the arrival of that grim savior. Plop, she lay and splayed her limbs out in total submission to this dark beast called life...
It was then something peculiar happened. Upon whipping her digits from her core, she made contact with something hard in the darkness. A metal peel rang out. Though hopeless depression muted her emotions, a bit of curiosity slipped through. Weakly, she grasped a small bauble and brought it to herself.
Her hands now eyes in the dark, she slowly molested the thing trying to understand what it was.
Thunder clapped and lightning dazzled the halls of her tomb! A roar from beyond time and space cleaved reality, and from the swirling void in this gash formed a being of smokeless fire.
""BEHOLD! THOU HATH SUMMONED, AND I HATH ANSWERED! SPEAK NOW, YOUR WISH, CHILD OF ADIM, AND SO SHALL IT BE.""
Also, this chick's name was Deborah. But I'll call her Deb or something.
For half an eternity, Debbie was blinded yet still stared-was speechless but still forced hair out of her huge, gaping mouth. For the first time in her life, she was speechless.
""It's just like Aladdin... ""she whispered, as she regained her senses.
""NO. NO, IT ISN'T,"" said the djinn. ""FRANKLY, I WASN'T VERY FOND OF THAT MOVIE. I'M MORE A *LITTLE MERMAID* ENTITY MYSELF, AND I'LL REVISIT *MULAN* FROM TIME TO TIME--BUT I DIGRESS! THE POINT REMAINS THAT THOU MUST MAKETH A WISH! NOW, SPEAK!""
Debbo thought for a moment. What would be the best use of this wish? Eliminating the gender pay gap? No, as much as she bitched about it, she was well aware that when adjusted for relevant differences, the gap all but disappears. Plus, she liked bitching too much about it.
That's it! She'll wish for everyone on Earth to have something to bitch about.
With a malignant grin spreading like a sin across her face, she stared off into forever and said those damning words: ""I wish everything... was CUBIST.""
And with that, the hot porn that David Poke had been stroking it to suddenly went ""Nude Descending A Stair Case"". Shocked, David rose only to find that his dick looked like a kaleidoscope puked on it. There were screams of terror outside his blob. Rushing over, he noticed that odd things were rushing about outside, shifting horribly through some god-awful medium, like koi through a raging pond.
Poke went to turn on the tele... something... and heard nothing but sobs from reporters not understanding what happened to their perfectly coiffed hair. There were people arguing over whether something was a leg or not. An oddly curved... triangle thing, I guess would be the best description, was beating the every loving... something....out of another thing. Really, it's all hard to explain, but it was an ugly situation.
Humanity had ended. Cubmanity had dawned. This was Debbie Shcloeman's curse. This was the Catartstrophe. And no one could ever really tell what was going on ever again.",0
"As the sky darkened and clouds moved in, a burst of lightning illuminated the charcoal sky and the surroundings low rises of Newarc, New Jersey. The artificial lights flickered to match the rhythm of the thunder. Above the operating table dressed in white robes, the Doctor was at work once again. After his last monster laid waste to his ancestral land in Europe, the Doctor was forced to exile himself. He chose the new world. With the town of Newarc in New Jersey as his home base, the Doctor was hard at work once again. This time with a plan to avenge those who wronged him. The thunder roared once again, masking the knocking at the door. He didn't hear the door slam open. It was Vincenza from the beauty salon on the ground floor, rollers still in her hair. With the spray tan on half of her body, she looked like she stepped into a mud pool on her way over. And with the expression on her face she looked more so the monster that jumped out of that pool.
Sneaking up on the Doctor she screamed, ""Hey would ya keep it down we gotta clients down der!""
The Doctor sprang into the air, surgical wire in hand.
""Oh my gwad what are ya up to?"" Vincenza, a New Jersey native and mob wife, confronted him in her thick Italian-America accent full of its nasality and coated with nosiness. She couldn't wait to see how this juicy piece of potential gossip would unfold. Her eyes widened.
""Erm ah um, vell I vaz jast doing some…threading"" The Doctor answered nervously in his thick German accent. He has been caught, he thought. After what happened in his homeland, he did not want to move again. Argentina would be his next destination; he has friends from his homeland's academia in exile there. But as a vegetarian with Crohn's he wanted to avoid steak and wine. Plus his grade school bully was from Buenos Aires. He did not want to bring back those painful memories.
""Oh threading! We do it all o'da time down der in our shop. We got some hawt badies comin'in today for a canstest and dey gotta look a real good. Real gold.""
""Bodies you say?"" The Doctor's shoulders and arms lowered and relaxed. A puzzled look came on his face. His creations were puzzles, and he personally carved the pieces. He was looking for a few items to compose his jigsaw.
""Oh ye! The hawtest badies in the state. Hell, the hawtest badies in da East of da country are a comin'a here. Happenin'in our salon in a half'a hour. You should come and checka her out. But keep da noise down ‘ cause we gotta get a finished making dem golden – if ya know what I mean sweethart."" Vincenza turned around and bounced towards the door like the jumpy mud monster that she looked like. Thinking she had the latest scoop on the new neighbour upstairs, who was now a mysterious eyebrow threader, she couldn't wait to share the news with her gals. She slammed the door behind her.
The Doctor was gleeful. That stupid monster has just handed him the parts for his next project. He removed his lab coat and ran to the back of the apartment. Climbing through the window, one leg at a time, he stumbled and fell onto the fire exit. The clumsy nerd that he was, he managed to tumble down the fire exit steps; the slippery rails and freshly wet steps helped him lose his balance. He forced his way through the back door of the beauty salon. There, his eyes widened and he froze. A tree of a man, with skin brown as oak bark and wide as the trunk, with a black hedgehog for hair stood in the narrow hallway behind the door and brought down his tiny dark eyes to stare at him.
""Hey boy you is a late. You must be dat natural fitness guy dey was a talkin'about. Scrawny as a mozzarella stick and soggy as a old pizza,"" The tree laughed, his roaring laughter shaking the walls
""Look at a yo scrawny self, and pale too. Good luck. But take a ya shirt and pants aff first, don't be a wuss.""
The Doctor was too afraid to say no. His Argentinian childhood bully taught him not to fight back. He complied. As he removed his clothes, his pale skin brightened up the room. As soon as he was in his bleached tighty-whities, the tree pushed him through a set of heavy and dark doors a few steps down the narrow hallway. The lights blinded him, and he covered up his eyes. The roaring laughter of the crowd pained his gentle academic ears, used to library volume. He squinted and viewed what was in front of him through the gaps in between his fingers…and froze...",0
"""Send orders for Sir Thompson to advance, General.""
The King's highest ranking officer bowed deferentially, and turned to pass the order down the chain of command.
""Wait, General.""
General Stewart stopped in his tracks, and turned back to face his King.
""Yes, your Highness?""
""If we have to do this 'Battle' malarkey, we do it the British way, or not at all. It's the other chap's turn right now, what what?""
Stewart betrayed his thoughts with a blank look of confusion.
""I...I'm not sure I follow, your Highness.""
""And here I was thinking you were a sporting fellow, Stewart! Poor show, poor show. Didn't you just see me order Bishop Allen to the attack? It's only right and proper that the gentleman opposite issues an order next.""
General Stewart considered debating the point, but soon thought better of the idea. ""As you will, your Highness. I will await the roundhead's next maneuvers.""
The King looked quite proudly, and not a little smugly, down at the man.
""Oh, and one more thing, Stewart.""
""Your Highness?""
""When you send Sir Thompson his orders, could you...could you tell him to just move...ooh, I don't know. Just move a little bit to the left once he's in place? Just to be proper, of course.""
The General sighed. What with the debacle involving a person instructed to wear a miniature castle in the last battle, and now this, the Royalist's hopes in this accursed civil war were looking slim.",0

"- So, what happened?
Well, I'm out chilling on my patio. Feet in the paddling pool, couple of beers and that fucking great new album Joey recommended on the speakers.
Suddenly some bloke runs up, panting and sweating. To be fair it was fucking warm that day, but he looked pathetic. He was whimpering and moaning that someone was trying to kill him. 'There's something off here', I thought to myself, 'he's either nuts or deserved what's coming to him'. There was something fishy about the man, a guilty, awkward look to him.
'Calm down mate, what's the problem?' I say.
'Hide me, hide me, he's coming', the guy goes, all high pitched and nervy.
By now I'm suspicious as fuck and there's no way I'm hiding this slug of a man. And then, just as I'm about to tell him to get to fuck, Joey comes legging it round the corner and down my path.
'Fucking peado cunt!' He yells.
Bloke tries to run but I trip him over. Gave him a right good boot. Instinct, right. Believe my man Joss before even speaking to him. And then, before I can ask even ask what's going on, Joey has hit the guy in the temple with this fucking spade. Sideways on, like. I've gotta be honest, I looked away but I don't think he stopped hitting him for a while.
What you expect the man to do though? This man was leeching on his 12 year old son. The man's a brute. I apologise for my language, but I say it as I see it. Joey's a good man, and you've already proved the guy was grooming his son. Self defence, innit.

"It's nearly 10 pm when you're driving down Basket Creek Road. There are no streetlights. This, combined with a heavy layer of fog, is really making you wish you had woken up a few hours earlier to make the 12 hour drive. It's been a full year since anyone has been to the little mountain home. Weeds have surely obscured the entrance, but sure enough you see a small piece of wood with the number ""42"" carved into it nailed onto a tree. You're here.
As you open the car door and step into the long grass, you find yourself again wishing you had gotten here earlier. The thought of snakes hiding in the grass terrifies you. Do snakes go out at night, though? Is it too cold for them? Even on these muggy summer nights? You can't remember your snake trivia, so you just hope for the best as you close the car door behind you.
The once red bridge has been stripped and repainted a dark gray. It sways as you drag your suit case across it. The brook underneath rages. It's been rainy lately. The water level is higher than normal. It helps to mask the problems with erosion that this area in the mountains has been having.
You reach the small house and look in your bag for the key. Did you remember to bring it? What if you left it at home? Fuck.
You find it.
You open the door and turn on the light. It's just the way you remember it. The black and white linoleum floor. Pictures of you and the cousins in the summer over the past 22 years. Pictures of distant relatives who would come up here before you. Some mouse droppings in the corner. You will have to lay out some traps tomorrow, but there's still too much work to do tonight.
You hate this part, but it's a necessity. You venture into the basement to turn on the water. There are only four stairs to get down there, but they creak loudly enough to alert anything down there of your presence. Not that anything would be down there, save for a few mice and bugs, maybe snakes. Those fears tend to stick with you though, even after childhood.
The water is turned on and you retreat back upstairs, closing the basement door behind you. You choose the small bedroom to stay in.
Opening the large trunk at the foot of the bed, you find sheets and pillow cases that somehow don't smell too bad. Usually you are met with a smell that takes a night or two to get used to.
You lay down, finally starting to think the long drive was worth it. You fall asleep looking forward to the week ahead of you.
In the morning you wake up and make a list of things to do for the day. You definitely will have to drive to Callicoon. You wonder if any more shops have closed in the dying little town. Without the ""Flea Market"" you realize that for the first time in 15 years you aren't going to be able to get a Cloisonne figurine to add to your small collection. Luckily though the supermarket, Peck's, is still there. You grab some groceries and as you drive back to the home you check to see which movie is playing this week. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is playing for the next two nights. Maybe you'll see it.
You get back to the home. Spending the day getting ready. You break out the old rider mower, hoping it still has some life in it after all the disuse and mow down the snake-hiding grass. You sweep up the bedrooms, set some mousetraps, and find the old cushions for the porch furniture.
By the end of the day you are exhausted, but all your hard work will be worth it. Tomorrow your family comes. Then will be the time for the fun. Will you hike the mountain tomorrow? See if the old diving spot about half a mile down the brook is still deep enough? Maybe tube down the Delaware River if the weather looks promising.
You sometimes wish you could bring other people up here. Sometimes you find yourself describing it to friends or dates or coworkers and they look at you like you are crazy.
No cell phone service. No internet. No television. Half the time you are here you are cleaning. The place almost always smells or feels damp. Rattlesnakes are fairly common. The nearest town is a twenty minute drive away, which isn't too bad, but there's nothing much there. A few kitschy shops, one grocery store, a one-screen movie theater. You worry that if you were to bring someone other than family that they won't appreciate it. But you do, and that's what matters. You spend the rest of the daylight reading on the screened in porch, listening to the nature around you.",0
"Summit Street is mostly empty in the fading twilight. This is the rough part of town, where the homeless guys huddle around a fire in an old metal garbage can and compare their goods after a long day of scouring the city for spare change and recyclables. A ragged man is clumsily weaving among the trashcans and streetlights toward the group of men holding their threadbare gloves out to the fire in an attempt to get warm. They ignore him; he's probably one of the drunks who frequently get lost on their way home from the seedy bar one street over.
When he finally reaches the group, they all make a point of avoiding his gaze, until he makes an inhuman sound: half gargle, half yelp. He tries again to speak, slowly forcing out the words ""help, please, help."" They stare at him as he produces a folded up picture from his pocket, obviously printed from a printer that needs a new magenta ink cartridge. With some obvious discomfort, and a few intermittent coughs, the man quietly says, ""This man killed my son. Have you seen him?"" They all study the picture silently. The printed face is clean-shaven and handsome; its owner is wearing a suit probably more expensive than what most people make in a year. He is smiling at the camera, but the smile doesn't extend to his eyes. Those are blue and icy, calculating. They all say ""no, sorry"" and turn away – all except one.
Glenn doesn't recognize the guy, but knows the sorrow of losing a son, and looks up to say something comforting. That's when he sees the man's eyes: a familiar icy blue, but no longer cold and calculating. Now they are sad and confused. This man has a scruffy beard, is caked with dirt, and has scabbed-over gashes on his face and hands. He's wearing old, worn hiking-gear, but he is definitely the man in the picture.
Glenn takes the picture, and unfolds the bottom part of the page. The news headline reads ""Hiking Disaster: Local Businessman and Son Fall From Faulty Rappelling Rope, Son Dies."" Glenn hands the picture back to man, who is now looking at him with hopeful desperation, and says ""no, sorry,"" turning back to the fire.",0
"""It's not posting.""

""Is this your serialized fanfiction?""
""Yeah, I've posted it every day and this is the first time it's ever had an issue.""

"Sometimes, when the sun goes down on the horizon, I close my eyes and pretend that I'm back home. I can practically feel the stained green carpet scraping the soles of my bare feet. The wind pushing my hair back from my face feels like it's coming in from the open window across from me, and even the heat from the sun brings me back to a simpler time of sitting in an overheated, overcrowded kitchen with my family. Yet when I open my eyes, I remember that that home is unreachable and unreal; it lives simply within a memory that will one day slip away. I often find myself searching for a solace in these sunsets, and leaving empty. I get so close to a life that I once knew, only to be brought back to a dimmer reality where the sun has hidden itself out of our reach.
A voice calls out from behind me, beckoning me back to here and now, yanking me from my daydreaming. It's silly, really, for me to be yearning for a life that I probably made up; there has only ever been Underground for me, and that's the home that I should be spending my time on. ""Winter?"" The voice repeats, closer now.
I let one last breath escape through my open mouth before standing. I make my way through the tall grass, then slip through the tree line like a whisper. ""Seth,"" I greet, silently stepping over broken twigs and dried out leaves.
""What are you doing out here, Winter? You know what Boss would say if he found out that you were here, let alone that you were sitting there in plain daylight – anyone could have seen you.""
I gently pull my hair behind my ears and into a tight knot at the base of my skull. ""And thought what, exactly? People out there don't expect much from someone like me."" I force out a chuckle, trying for a moment to picture myself from their point of view: a teenage girl with jet black hair, standing just above five feet tall. I would seem helpless, innocent, and naive. ""Plus,"" I continue with a small smile, ""it's not as though sunrise is plain daylight.""
Seth runs his hands roughly through his blonde curls. ""You know what I mean."" He puts a hand softly on my shoulder and catches my eyes. ""They all look up to you, Winter. If any of those kids down there heard that you were just sitting out here, you know that they would all try to come Outside and sit here, too. You have a responsibility, if not to Boss, then to them.""
""They're not my children, and I sure as hell didn't bring them down there,"" I snap. ""Just because they happened to be taken in by Boss, like us, and they just happen to be living in the same facility as us, it doesn't mean that I have to treat them like they're my children or something. I don't have to shape everything that I do for their benefit.""
I stop when Seth drops his hand from my shoulder and steps a few paces away. He studies the ground as though the answers to the universe may be hidden beneath the decomposing remnants of summer. He shakes his head before raising his eyes to meet my own. ""We're all they've got, Winter. You know that.""
Somewhere inside of me I know that he's right; it's the same part of me that's yearning for a home and a family. I've spent the past five years Underground, taking each day and each mission in stride, waiting for something to happen that gives me a glimpse to the past that's been taken from my memory. Boss told me, on that first day, that it was my thirteenth birthday, and it was time for me to grow up – time for me to take responsibility. He showed me around Underground, showed me all of the dorms and the classrooms, the lounge and the cafeteria, and explained to me the importance of my presence there. I was his prodigy, and I was to be in charge of Underground one day. I was to care for the younger children there, children as young as six, and I was to demand respect from any of them that were older than me.
It was never much of a choice for me. When you can't remember anything but your name, and what happened only a few hours earlier is shrouded in a deep fog, it's not as though you can decide what to do with a clear head. I did as Boss said, and I did it well. Five years later, I'm still doing what he says.
It's not as though I don't care about the kids that are Underground with us. I practically raised them, after all. My entire memory was taken up by long evenings training kids that were falling behind, and sleepless nights spent tossing and turning and praying that they would still be there in the morning. It wasn't that I didn't care about what happened to them. It was more about needing to breathe in fresh air every once in a while, and about pretending for even a minute that I belonged in a world of stained green carpet and open windows.
(This is what I have so far as a first chapter of an ongoing thought in my mind. Mostly hoping it's enough of a hook, but I am all for constructive criticism.)",0
"Ragnar was tired. He slouched low into his lair and slumped on his, albeit enormous, couch in front of the TV.
He loved his job, all he'd ever wanted to be was a cop, but something was missing. He'd assumed he could break the mold, be different to the other dragons in the force. The first few months were full of optimism and determination, but the last few years...well, the last few years were slowly wearing him down.
It wasn't the rejection from the Intelligence Unit that had disappointed him the most, it was difficult for a dragon to go undercover after all, it was the realization that he really only served one purpose. There was only one reason the Force employed dragons; traffic reports. The eye in the sky. It wasn't why Ragnar had joined up. Dwarves were the rank and file, Orcs the Riot Police, Faeries the under cover detectives, Elves were the Chiefs and Dragons were the air support. That's just the way it was. It's the way it had always been. Ragnar didn't think this was fair. On occasion, he'd voiced this opinion to the other dragons, but they would just laugh.
""We have wings, Raggy! Wings! What else would we do?"" they would scoff.
Varyn once suggested crowd control. ""Fire breath, lads!"" He would say. ""Fire breath! One quick huff and the goblins will scatter, we'll be heroes! And the ones that don't get out of the way would make a lovely snack."" He'd usually be drooling at this point.
Varyn's opinions weren't usually given much attention.
Ragnar sighed. He heaved himself up and climbed the tunnel that led to the top of the cliff. His cave sat atop a mountain overlooking the city to the south, but if he turned north and crossed to the other side, he could see the stars. Moonlight glinted off the river at the bottom of the valley, it led all the way north to the Plains. One day he'd follow it. One day he'd just keep going and never turn back. One day..... but not today.
There was a loud pop, followed by a high pitched whizzing, followed by another pop. Warlocks. Arching his neck behind him, he could see the faint purple and pink after glow of a firework. The Warlocks in their tower were experimenting again. It wasn't enough that he hated his job, but those damned Warlocks were trying to put him of it by building flying machines!
Ragnar had friends amongst the Faeries however, and faeries had no great love of Warlocks. Nobody was really sure if the Warlocks were a race of being unto themselves, or if it was just a coincidence that all the Warlocks were the same race. Either way, the Faeries were of the opinion that were thieves of magic. It didn't take a lot of effort to convince the Faeries to sabotage a few experiments here and there.
Ragnar sat perched atop the mountain watching the Warlock drift slowly to the ground. They at least, had the sense to invent parachutes first.",0
"Gieta sat in the field near her house surrounded by daisies and sweet-grass, weaving the two together in absent boredom. This place used to be her favorite place. It was a place where any adventure could happen, where any story from the imagination of an eight year old girl could and would come to life. Not any longer though. The grass seemed dull. The flowers seemed listless. How dreary it was. She didn't want to be there anymore. Gietas train of thought was cut off from the sound of footsteps striding through the grass.
""Uncle Brathe!"" She exclaimed, glad to see someone who would help relieve her problem of nothing to do. Uncle Brathe was always a favorite. If Uncle Brathe didn't have a good story to tell (which he always did) or if he didn't bring sweets with him (which he always did) or if he didn't pick her up and rub his bearded cheek against hers (may the powers forbid!) he would still be her favorite. He still remembers how to play. As she ran to meet him, her Uncle lifted her off the ground and greeted her as he always did.
""Uncle, where have you been? You have not visited me for weeks now!""
""I know Darlin', I know. Your old Uncle has been busy.""
""I wished for you to visit every day and you never came. But now that you're here, we can play!"" Her Uncle set her down, and as he did the cheerful demeanor diminished. He crouched down beside her in the over bearing shade of the orchard.
""Actually Darlin' I thought we could just talk for a bit."" Gietas face scrunched up. Her parents had been talking to her an awful lot lately. About how she spends too much of her time dreaming of things. She didn't see the problem.
""Did my Mom tell you to do this?"" She asked, feeling slightly betrayed.
""No sweet pea, she didn't. I haven't visited your Mom in a long time because she still hasn't forgiven me and you know how upset she gets when she sees me."" Uncle Brathe started weaving dead sweet grass together as he continued. ""You need to understand darlin' that the things you can do when you're asleep is a rare gift that many others can't do, nor can they comprehend what it is like."" He set aside the grass, and reached for leaves on the saggy tree. ""I understand though, because that's exactly what I used to do and look how I ended up."" Geita went to speak but he stopped her.
""I know it's like godhood described in the old tomes, to be an ultimate creator but the problem is that you are not a God of the Beginning. You are a sweet little girl with freckles. You must feed your dreams with the experience of life."" He stood and picked up a dried up stick, as a knight would draw his sword.
""Do you remember when we saved the village from the Shadow Breathers? You learned those sword tricks from your Father."" He slashed the air with his stick. ""Or what about the time you wove a web so great that we lifted the Ocean King to the surface so he could see his own childrens wedding? Your mother taught you to weave, you know."" Gieta picked up a stick of her own and swatted at her Uncle.
""Well ya, but real life is so boring! I can't control anything around me and I have to do everything that everyone else says."" They weaved in and out of the lack luster orchard sparring back and forth.
""If you don't live a little now and again darlin, eventually the dreams will get just as boring. The color will slowly start fading, and the adventure becomes a routine. Life is what creates dreams, not the other way around."" The thought stopped Gieta as she lunged with her substitute sword.
""What did you do then, Uncle? When your dreams became gray and still?""
""I blamed the waking world. I cursed it for lacking everything I had once been able to do in my thoughts. But I was wrong, sweet Gieta. I was so wrong. What I did in the name of dreaming was unforgivable."" They had stopped sword fighting now and held each others gaze for a long moment. A breeze drifted through, much colder than normal.
""I think I understand, Uncle. I will try to feed my dreams, but it sounds terribly hard."" Uncle Brathe kneeled in front of Gieta.
""It is my dear. It's very hard and very important that you start as soon as you can.""
""Ok Uncle. I promise I'll try. As soon as I wake up.""",0
"The first couple weeks after assignment day were kind of a blur of change and chaos. The first day not much happened, people were just trying to figure out what happened to them. Who did this? What does yours say? What does it mean? These questions were asked about a million times that day.
They were quickly forgotten once people realized that they also now had powers with their assigned roles. The roles were not random, doctors became healers or clerics, chemist were alchemist or potion brewers, farmers tended to be herbalist, gymnast were ninjas or acrobats. If you spent a lot of time hiking you would probably become a ranger or a druid. American football players mostly became berserkers or barbarians.
At first the government encouraged us to stay at homes, then they declared martial law, then there was no government. People quickly revolted once they found out most politicians were thieves or illusionists. People started forming militias and guilds, it is incredible how quickly people started using words from RPGs.
Most governments around the world fell in the first few weeks. Those that didn't started invading and conquering other lands. At first they used the old world weapons: guns and missiles. They worked at first but soon they became obsolete. Most classes had some sort of power against bullets. Magicians would cast ‘ barrier ’, warriors would ‘ protect'or ‘ defend ’, martial artists and ninjas could ‘ evade'and ‘ dodge ’.
New governments rose, there was a complete overhaul of the education system. Below the age of 14 everyone was a youngling. Then you would get your role and you were sent to that school to learn how to use your powers. Science had to be rewritten because most natural laws of the old world were no longer valid. The whole world changed in one night.
I know all this and more because when I woke up that morning the word on my arm was GOD. At first I couldn't do much. People didn't believe me much at first. Then they started following me and worshiping me. That is when I started having real power. The more they prayed to me the stronger I would become. Offering gave me tingles, sacrifices were a rush of power and strength. There were limits to my power but I was stronger than all the other classes. Except for the other Gods.",0
"The most predictable part about them is that they don't expect to be seen. Sometimes I'll see one on the street, and I'll take the opportunity to study them. If the notice me staring, they freak out. They'll hide behind people, bushes, lamps, anything that'll hide them from one who sees. I guess they're told that they must always remain hidden, or they'll suffer some great consequence; I can't really think of any other explanation for that kind of reaction.
Having asked many people in my area, I've come to realise that people like me are rare, but exist. We can see the ""soul escorts"". Not to be confused with spirit guides, the benevolent creatures who apparently help you through your life, these creatures help you end it. In the past I've been able to prevent deaths because I've seen them, but I decided, with the help of a forum comprised of only Seers, that the risk of playing with mortality is too great. Some have provided evidence that ghosts or other supernatural apparitions are what you get when someone dies without their spirit guide, left to wander Earth for eternity, with no way out.
I suppose I'm glad that most people can't see them, because mass hysteria would break out in seconds. They aren't a pretty sight. Imagine, if you will, a wholly intact, yet mottled corpse constantly standing next to you. When they walk, they do so with a slow, limping gait, trailing their umbilical cord behind them. That's how I see them, anyway. Others see an oversized fly hovering by the shoulder, and still others just see a dark aura around the unlucky bastard.
I've led my life carefully up until this point; if someone has *unwelcome company* I'll quickly leave their presence, and it's worked up until this point, because I'm still alive. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like I'll stay that way for long. In the past five minutes, more and more escorts have appeared in this bus. I've been trying to avoid looking at any of them. The last thing I want in my final moments is a bus full of both humans and escorts freaking out.
Mine still hasn't appeared yet, but I'm sure it will soon. I hope it does.
EDIT: All critisicm very welcome, I love doing this but I want to improve.",0
"""It is time now, father. I must depart on my quest to fulfill my holy greatness,"" said James as he stood in the doorway, covered in white flowing robes as gentle winds beckoned his body to free itself of the threshold. His father, balding and middle aged barely looked up from the comfy chair as his son stood with the holy light blasting from behind his head. ""On this day, I shall bring onto the world a new age of joy, but it will come at the cost of tremendous strife. What say you, father? What shall I do to temper the world's terror as this new age dawns?""
His father cleared his throat a little as he folded the newspaper over and saw an advertisement for a lawnmower he wanted. Most people didn't read the newspaper anymore, but Milton was old-school. He glanced at James above the rims of his glasses and then went back to the paper. ""Well, you probably shouldn't talk like that if you want people to take you seriously."" James blinked. He didn't know what to say.
""Is that...is that it, my father? I go forth to usher in a new age, have you nothing else to give unto me before I depart?""
""That's what I'm talking about. No one says unto and go forth anymore, James. I mean, your mother and I put up with it...because, well because you're our son, but...but you probably should put a lid on that,"" Milton elaborated.
""Father, please- I love you so greatly, impart unto me a greater word of wisdom before-""
""And don't go around telling people you love them,"" Milton cut in, dropping the newspaper now. ""People don't want to be told by random strangers that they're loved. You'll- you'll end up in the loony bin."" James stood speechless. Milton watched him for a second and then turned on the TV and started watching the football game.
""Well...I guess I'll just go then,"" James shrugged. Milton nodded halfheartedly as he turned up the volume. ""I'm- I'm off now. I'm off to change the entire world. So...uh, so goodbye!""
""Alright, goodbye James,"" Milton mumbled. James looked around, unsure of what else to say and closed the door silently, as to not disrupt his father's beloved football game.",0
"The memory came unbidden. A wretched child, unwanted in a city without orphanages. Scraping a living to survive like all the other urchins. Dashing between alleys to avoid the urban predators. Begging for alms and receiving kicks as often as kindness. Being tormented by those who were older or just larger.
The flashes of ancient emotion flooded into the mind. Fear, anger, longing, hopelessness. The child was chased out of so many places, forced away from cramped fires and meager meals. Despondent and starving the child went the only place left for the night: a cemetery.
The tombs were always cold but dry at least. Sometimes even some moldy food offerings left for the spirits by the priests. Some few other miserable and lost lost were already there. Claiming these slight refuges as well. The Child finally finds a crypt not guarded. Clawing a way through a rusted grate.
Inside was safety at last and a surprise. A fire, black as a void, burns eternally in a sconce. It offered naught but were-light, but also heat against the chill of night. This place of death gave life for the child in more ways than one. The only other occupant a brooding raven atop her nest high in a broken window. The child curled up to rest.
---------------------------------------------------
An age later the mighty Lich stoods over it's domain. The cries and groans of a fallen army writhing in its death throes rose up to the delight of the carrion eaters. The flocks and murders of them followed the Lich like a fell cloud. From this phenomena the Lich was known as the Carrion Bringer. It's coming was always foreshadowed by the arrival of the Lich's pet: the Raven King.
---------------------------------------------------
The child is awakened by by the chirping cries of hatchlings. Insisting on morsels from their mother. When she left one attempted to follow but his meager fledgling wings proved insufficient and he fell. The baby bird dropped right onto the child and this proved enough to disturb the torpor of awakening.
""You fell? You can't go back home?"" The child asked as the chick cheeped and pecked at a finger hungrily. The child tried to return the infant but alas the nest was too high. ""I'm sorry, I can't get you home...I can't go home either...Let's find some food okay?"" The child soothed the trembling chick and tucked it into a tiny breast pocket.
Casting about there was indeed a tray of spoiled food left for the dead, pushed through a slot under the door. The child consumed it but the little raven could not eat it. knowing the dead are eaten by bugs and the birds eat bugs the child decided to push open the crypts solitary coffin. It's brittle wooden lid gave way even to the Child's meager touch.
Inside there were indeed insects to be had. Which the tiny bird ate happily. Yet as the Child sought through the moldering remains something else was found. A book strangely enough one that hadn't rotted with it's owner. The Child pulled it out and admired it's black leather binding, and blue-gold script circling the bejeweled skull emblazoned on it's cover.
---------------------------------------------------
The Lich strode through the frozen city, listening to the howling winds of winter in it's deserted streets. The corpses left bloody smears in the pristine white as the undead dragged them from their homes and shops. Soon they too would join the ranks of the un-breathing horde. These streets were so familiar and yet so foreign now.
Once the Lich reached the cemetery it stopped and beheld the trove before it. It raised its spindly fingers and from withered lips an incantation went forth. The ground began to tremble and gravestones began to topple as the earth gave way beneath them. More recruits for the Lich's army clawed their way back into the daylight.
The Lich walked among them looking for one particular crypt...
---------------------------------------------------
Child became adult and adult became mage. The cruel writings of the book forced themselves into the impressionable mind. Growing in power and meaning as the Mage became more skilled. The Mage happily ignored this dark influence and enjoyed a simple life. Mending broken items and lifting simple curses was always in demand.
The fledgling too had grown into the Mage's familiar. Uplifted from a simple beast by their unbreakable bond. Speaking to each other in their own language, sharing life's little joys and pleasures. The Mage was not wealthy nor influential, not having had the money or connections to attend a school nor attract a master. No a simple lodging over a small shop was all they required.
The Mage sat on his balcony taking in an afternoon's sun with a cup of tea and a table of broken wares to repair. Chatting amiably with the Raven on his perch. The cries or a pack of children in the street below brought a painful smile to the Mage, a remembrance of a wasted youth. Then the unexpected happened.
The children were taunting a small urchin. Throwing rocks and insults alike. The Mage knew that pain and called down angrily from the balcony above for them to stop. The distraction proved enough and the victim got away. The bullies didn't take lightly to this and one unfortunate stone sailed up to the balcony...
---------------------------------------------------
The tomb doors disintegrated easily and the Lich strode inside. The long ruined coffin and darkly burning sconce still stood where once a sad urchin had once found solace. The coffin was swept aside and beneath a stone lid was revealed. Inside was something the Lich had long sought and killed to find...
---------------------------------------------------
The Mage screamed aloud in a pain deeper than any previously known. The bloodied stone sat beside the wounded raven at the base of his perch. The old bird had always been there for the Mage. Huddled together in the streets, finding food and hiding spots they had become more than partners.
The children below had died quickly when the fireball struck them. The screams and alarms of other citizens around had led to the clang of alarm bells. The Mage cared not except for the grief, and anger. Soon the guards would come to take the Mage away. To leave the beloved Raven here as it's vibrant but meager life bled away.
NO that could not come to pass...words welled up from forgotten times. A foul mist began to seep from the locked chest in the attic. The Mage tenderly scooped up the beloved familiar and carried him inside. The Mage barred his doors and threw open the chest, drawing forth the black book. There was something to be done....
---------------------------------------------------
The Lich beheld the object of it's long quest. An item so lost to history as to become a legend. The Philosopher's stone. It had been here all this time not far from the resting place of it's creator above, whose wicked tome had guided the Lich for so long. The Raven King cawed from the rafters of the tomb. The Lich turned and saw that the creature had settled upon a long abandoned nest.
""Yes my friend, we are finally home""",0
"Unrequited love is the worst kind of suffering a man can endure. I pined for her, my Anna. She with the hair like chocolate and her skin as pale as the moon in the sky. She moved like grace through a crowd of sinners, touching each person who had the benefit of knowing her. I was not among the lucky.
High school ended and the years softened the ache that had settled within me. I went through relationships like colds, seeing her face in each and moving on. I learned she left our small town and with her went my chance at happiness, but I was happy for her. Truly I was.
It was a cold day in December when I saw her again. She wore the years apart like the fine scarf wrapped around her neck and her eyes reflected the places I imagined she'd been. With nothing more to lose, I said hello and she spoke to me. I offered her a cup of coffee and a place to warm up and she agreed with a smile that I would've killed to see in high school.
By the end of our impromptu date, I'd learned that she had indeed seen the world, had been to places I could only imagine and done things she was hesitant to talk about. We each had our demons and I knew a girl as beautiful as Anna had surely made her own share of mistakes with men.
Reluctantly, she agreed to a second date. Then a more enthusiastic third. I was in love before our first kiss, shared on the bleachers behind our old high school under a full moon. I learned she liked to bite when she kissed, a quirk I fell in love with. It was heaven on earth.
I dropped her off that night already planning on the ring and proposal. She liked emeralds over diamonds. White gold over yellow. She was a simple girl with simple pleasures, just looking to rediscover her roots and settle down.
The sensation came to me in a flood. I knew it meant that she loved me back and I rejoiced. It was a common bond that could never be broken. She was truly my souls mate.
I stopped for flowers in the morning and noticed the cashier as if for the first time. She walked weakly on her left foot, perhaps due to an old cheer-leading injury. She was slow and I knew I could break her neck as quickly as a cat's and deposit her body behind the dumpsters where no one would discover it until I was safely out of town.
I vomited and left the building without the flowers, leaving the cashier with a questioning look upon her face. My Anna had the answers and I knew it would be a rational one.
She was sitting on the sofa with eyes that looked like she'd spent the night crying. She embraced me when she saw me and my fears evaporated in the air between us. There had to be an explanation. This was meant to be a happy occasion after all, but even as I held her, I knew I thought of all the ways I could kill her and how easy it would be to slip a knife between her third and fourth rib into her heart.
My eyes strayed to the kitchen. I felt her heart beating against my chest and thought of the ways I could separate it from her body. I knew it would have to be cooked on a low heat to keep in the juices and that the human heart was best paired with Pinot Noir. I loved her and in spite of myself, my stomach grumbled.",0
"Shoot! I woke up late.
I pulled whatever clothes I could find out of the drawer; they're all basically the same. I check the mirror to make sure the top is lighter than the bottom. That's the only fashion tip I know, and I need to look good today. Today is the first day of high school, a new start, and I am not going to mess this one up. This past summer, I finally convinced my parents to move me to a private school. In my public school experience, I was constantly bullied. They laughed at my appearance, my hobbies, my voice and I was done with that. Today I was going to make a great impression, make lots of friends, and finally be that popular kid. It all begins with this, the first day of high school.
I put on my backpack, grab my lunchbox, stick a slice of toast in my mouth, and I'm out the door. If I sprint, I might be able to make it before the opening ceremony starts.
As I round the corner onto the main road, I see a cat. I've heard bad things about cats. Some of my neighbors tell me that dark cats cause bad luck. I'm hoping this doesn't mean I'll have bad luck at school today; I ignore the thought and keep on running.
I see the gate up the street and there are still other kids walking in! Thank God! I'm going to make it! The five minute bell rings as I make it through the gate. Now I need to head towards the auditorium. I stop to check one of the floor plans posted in the halls; I find the auditorium and continue towards it.
I stop outside the doorway. I'm a little out of breathe, so I want to regain some composure before I make my grand entrance. I take a deep breathe. As I'm about to step through the door, someone shoves me to the ground.
I lie there for a few seconds. Everything is ruined. My grand entrance, my chances to be popular, my new high school life is gone. Tears form, and I try to hold them back as I pick myself up. Suddenly I notice something change. It's impossible for me to describe what I see, but it makes me feel warm. There are still shades, some lighter some darker, but there's something more. Nothing looks like it did before.
My thoughts are suddenly interrupted.
""Why were you lying on the floor?""
I look behind me and there's a girl staring at me. I try to describe what I'm seeing, but nothing comes out of my mouth. I end up just staring at her.
""Whatever, bye.""",0
"Caius paused, sighed, and placed his goblet on the stone slab between them. ""Another wine. I'm gonna need it.""
Favian obliged, taking care to remove the cork silently. ""So what happened to him?""
""You remember the way Aurelius, in the river drills, would always insist on helping the last soldier up the bank before finishing it himself? He couldn't let another man go down, just wasn't in him. It kept him out of a centurion position, I know it."" He took a sip. ""Also made him perfect for this mission. Just make sure Caius gets back alive, they said. Well, he was born for that kind of assignment."" Another pause, as he set his goblet down and rubbed his brow.
""I don't know why he couldn't just look after his fucking self for once!"" Tears welled in Caius'eyes, but he banished them with a grit of teeth.
Favian looked around the cave nervously, pricking his ears for footfalls. He studied Caius'dimly lit face, silently urging him to continue.
""You have to understand, we'd been paddling up that godforsaken river for months. The rains had come and gone, we'd gone through most of our original crew and two sets of conscripted natives, losing them all to sickness, or arrows, or any of those insane jungle beasts they grow down in the southlands; snakes, swarming fish, leopards. And those bloodthirsty chimps. Fuck, the sound of those things.
""But what befell Aurelius, my god. At least with a chimp you can fight, with a leopard you can run, but these things -""
He stopped his tale as they heard a crash in the passage above. The two soldiers froze, listening for a sign to retreat to the crevice again. After long moments of measured breath, there was nothing. Caius steadied himself, took a drink, and went on.
""We'd reached a point in the river where we felt sure we were near the source, close to the ‘ mythic fountain'of the traveler's legend. Supposedly there was a point in the river where we would pass a sharp bend and come upon a confluence of three waters into a shallow lake. ‘ A steamish, bubblish bath from devil!'”--Caius mimicked the traveler's broken Latin. ""Supposedly at the bottom of that lake lived the god-shells.""
Favian's eyebrow raised. He'd heard legends of the god-shell, but wrote them off as military grandstanding, something to give hope to the dwindling ranks.
Caius sensed his skepticism. ""You never held that piece of god-shell, did you?"" He flared a grim smile as Favian shook his head. ""Say what you will about that traveler, his blade was like nothing I've ever felt.""
Caius lightly ran his finger across the lip of the goblet. ""Were this a god-shell goblet, that would have cut me to the bone. The traveler's blade was as light as eagles'feathers, yet you could place it over a campfire, mold it into any shape you desired, and it would cool rigid as bronze, and twice as strong. I saw with these eyes the traveler mold his blade into a visage of Diana, and back again, in only the hour of the setting sun. In my darkest moments on that river, this vision pressed me on. Such a weapon, if produced for an army…""
""But where did it come from?""
Caius'gaze wandered to the cave depths. ""We had it, too. Sure enough, Aurelius dove to the bottom of that pool and came up bloodied but ecstatic. ‘ It's there, he said! Hand me the straps!'Within hours we had hauled one of them up.""
""What? What was it?""
""How to describe the god-shell? In essence, it was some kind of oyster or clam, but each one was the size of three men, and instead of mottles on its shell, it was all spires, and flourishes like acanthis on the temple columns, spiraling and sprouting, and razor sharp, spangled in colors from aged copper to deep oxblood. The traveler's blade was made from it, I knew immediately.
""Now this lake was the length of ten circuses, as wide as five Tibers, and the bottom was completely lined with god-shells. It seemed such an ordeal, but if we could bring back a couple specimens, we could breed them! And with an army clad and armed with god-shell, we could beat back any of these bastard Vandal hordes. We could push the borders outward, we could tame the very jungle! And just imagine, the splendor of our temples with this wonder as ornament! It was a worthy cause. Aurelius, you died for a worthy cause, I swear.""
He drained his goblet and placed it on the slab. Favian did not move to pour another. Caius eyed him menacingly, and Favian poured again.
""Now remember it was just the two of us and the boat at this point. But we let the thought of glory overcome our better judgment. We drained the last of the voyage's remaining wine that night, and fell asleep in our tents beside the pool, instead of climbing back aboard the boat.
""When it happened, I remember thinking it was a dream or nightmare. I opened my eyes to look out on the lake and I saw one of the shimmering shells, slowly, almost imperceptibly rising from the flat plane of the lake. How could I react, when it was like nothing I'd ever seen? How could I prepare?""
Favian waited for him to gather himself, ever wary of the thought of intruders.
Caius continued – ""Aurelius never woke up. I still wonder whether I did. But just as slowly as the god-shell rose, so quickly its shell flew open and a tongue thrust out--just past me--and it was around him! I saw his eyes bulge in awareness for a moment before the thing tightened, wrapping around him, this horrible pink pulsing mass, it just took him. It receded into the shell, with him in its grip, and before I could even sit up it was all gone—sunk back into the depths.",0
"Dr Phillip Rothsen checked the address twice before he pressed the embedded ID Chip in his palm to the sensor panel. He was travelling incognito, hoping that no one would recognise him as the celebrity CEO of RoboInc, and the last thing he needed was to ring the wrong doorbell.
In his mind, the missive which arrived via old-school snail mail the week before played on repeat, taunting him ceaselessly – ""Your robot has gained sentience. See for yourself.""
The encrypted link included in the missive saved it from being regarded as just another tasteless prank. What Dr Rothsen saw intrigued him, but prudence prevailed. He would investigate quietly, and only if there was any merit to the claim would he let the rest of the board know.
""I'm glad you've come to observe,"" said the teenaged girl who answered the door, ""I was about ready to go public with this, and your endorsement of my findings will certainly lend weight to it.""
""Sharlene, right? Where are they now?""
""In the bedroom upstairs. Come, I've set up an observation post.""
Dr Rothsen trailed after Sharlene as they reached the top of the stairs, skipped the first door, then went into the second. His trained eye seized immediately on the sophisticated surveillance setup on the only desk in the room. On the screen, he saw an elderly gentleman tending to an equally ancient lady in bed.
""They know you're watching them?""
""No. I had it set up before my grandparents moved in."" Sharlene pulled up a chair for Dr Rothsen, then went back to tending the complex array of controls. ""Though I only started watching them after my suspicions were aroused.""
""How did you even get all this equipment?""
""Earned it, doing odd repair jobs here and there. I'm going to be your company's biggest competitor one day, you just don't know it yet. But this is more important than some petty rivalry, so please, focus.""
The rebuke stung, especially since Dr Rothsen was used to being treated with veneration. Sulking mildly, he held his tongue as Sharlene turned up the volume, and the sounds from the next room wafted in gently.

Stirring from her light slumber, the bedridden woman coughed, and her companion immediately set aside his book and brought over a cup from the nightstand. The man eased her up into a sitting position, then held the cup to her lips as she sipped.
""I've enough, thank you.""
""More. Drink, more.""
""Later, please,"" the woman said firmly, gently pushing on his forearm. ""It's such a bother getting to the loo. And my throat's better now.""
""You are not well,"" the man said, grimly. ""I will take care of you.""
""Oh, Roger, I know you mean well, but you fuss too much sometimes. Has the next episode of *Not The Devil Again* been simulcast? Be a dear and put it on, will you?""
The man shook his head, not unkindly. ""In an hour. Still early.""
""Did the Devil ever find out why he lost his ability to time-travel? I can't imagine him escaping this particular predicament.""
""Maybe today he will,"" came the reply, slow and plodding. ""Yesterday he almost solved it.""
They resumed their silent companionship, she looking out the window to the boundless sky, he peering to the dog-eared book upon his lap. Then, her hand, creeping slowly across the quilted covers, found his.
""Roger, there's no need to be here with me all the time. Go on, don't worry about me.""
""I like it here. I will stay.""
""You would, wouldn't you? Even if I can't walk like how I did, dance like how I did?""
""Stay. You still smile like how you did. That's enough for me.""

Dr Rothsen's hands, shaking violently, gripped the edge of the table. A violent ball of queasiness, equal parts fear and wild untamed excitement, churned in his belly. Sharlene muted the audio feed, then sat back with a grim expression on her face.
""See what I mean? The robot's obviously exceeding its programmed parameters, and somehow circumventing the mandatory daily memory wipe.""
""Yes, I can see that,"" said Dr Rothsen, ""I know that show they were talking about, it is simulcast daily. And for the robot to be able to recall the previous episode…""
""That's not just it, of course. In the clip I sent you, I highlighted no less than 10 other examples confirming the circumvention. The robot is learning, and the robot is remembering. Fast.""
Dr Rothsen tapped on his biometric watch, and hastily activated the diagnostic tools he had brought along. Unseen signals flew frantically between his watch and the robot in the next room. The display frizzled briefly as he struggled to make sense of the numbers streaming past.
""This is an ElderCare model you purchased last year?""
""Yes, to provide basic company, assist with minor chores.""
""Then your claims of sentience? How do you know that's not the advanced linguistics we installed?""
Sharlene's eyes twinkled. ""Because I asked. I asked the robot to its face whether its memories extended beyond 24 hours, and the robot said no. Tell me, Dr Rothsen, do any of your other ElderCare models know how to lie?""
The images on the holoscreen loomed before them, impossibly real, impossibly onerous. Dr Rothsen's eyes tracked the robot as it moved, talked and behaved just like one of them. His heart beat wildly.
""Have you tried deactivating it?""
""What? And risk upsetting my grandpa? Of course not. In his condition, he needs stability, familiarity, and the last thing I want him to see is me opening up grandma for a maintenance check. He's happy just taking care of her in the only way he knows, and that's good enough for me.""
""So then how are we going to find out what makes it different, special? How on earth did a simple AI subroutine learn to circumvent the mandatory daily memory wipes?""
Sharlene shrugged, leaned back and propped her feet on the desk.
""That's why I asked you over. But if I had to guess, I would say that the robot may have just been won over by my grandpa. Such a charmer, isn't he?""

"In the land of the dead, a healer is a bad thing.
I accidentally made a vampire explode trying to heal his cut. The elder lich to his left tried attacking me, but was so badly hurt by a simple touch that she ran off. And then there was the incident with the zombie hoarde. I didn't know that healing a sodding zombie would make it loyal!
And then the spirits started to come to me. They wanted either deliverance or residence. I jokingly said I needed an empire first so that they could haunt somewhere in peace while I tried. Didn't realise they and the zombies took this to heart and started planning. The next thing I knew, I had angry dead and undead attacking me, and a body count higher than Dracula (he sent his congratulations). And an empire.
In the land of the dead, a healer can be a very bad thing.",0
"Macdillion sat at his desk fiddling with the controls to the American nuclear arsenal. He didn't swear but felt tempted to then. Everything was in disorder-his fine, pianist fingers, his memorabilia of the World Wars and the struggle to liberate the world from itself was trashy. Chaotic. Disgraceful. He glanced up and glowered at the next peon to roll in.
""What?"" he demanded, scrabbling the nuclear control in his sticky hands, hating the rough feel and smell of it. ""I might kill you if you don't have a good answer for me.""
The peon stuttered.
""Talk. I won't kill you then. Calm down."" Macdillion reasserted control over himself and set the control down.
""Sir, there's a spy in the base!""
""And?"" he demanded. His servants never told him enough and he suspected they hid things from him.
""He's after you! He's killed the guard!""
""Send security after him then. It's not as if we don't pay the louts enough. What else has he done then? Why haven't I heard any of this?""
""Security's gone!"" The servant twisted his fingers alarmingly. ""All of them, dead on the ground! The wires been cut and the cameras are all out. We've been trying to contact you sir, I promise, but he came in like a bolt of lightning and chopped us off! Look!""
He thrust a computer screen up for Macdillion to look at. Macdillion gazed balefully at the screen.
He pulled out a gun and shot in one solid motion. The servant flopped onto the ground and spilled blood on the expensive carpet. Macdillion sighed, and sat down.

"It was a giant hammer. Bob didn't have any time to react, but his police trained instincts did.

"I wiped the blood from my cleaver, a crimson pool forming as my rag pushed the substance down the blade. ""Such a beautiful thing..."" I mused to myself as I set the steak on the pan.

""Allison, I need twenty two more this week."" said the figure in the shadows. I pretend she's a she and her name is Zephyr; it's so freeing compared to the shadows she cloaks herself in.
""I suppose that's doable...I presume you'll handle the paperwork?"" I respond as I take a sip of my drink; a cold amber ale fresh from the taps.
""Of course. Don't I always?"" she responded before slipping out of the booth and slinking towards the back hallway. She always did have such a lovely gate. Oh, if only...
_________________________________________________________________
Alexis is such a delight. I met her on Monday and she has the very best schedule! A truly gifted life;
* 0800 she wakes to the gentle chorus of lyrebirds saying beautiful things
* 0810 she walks down her mahogany floored hallway to her private shower
* 0840 she towels off...
* 0850 is breakfast, prepared not by a machine, but a personal chef
* 0945 she dresses for work
* 1100 she heads to work, her chauffeur navigating her helicopter through the busy air ways.
* 1700 the office work ends and her chauffeur whisks her to the Zoroastrian Temple on 1E5D7C Ave
* 1900 with her chosen deities attended to, she heads for dinner, the chauffeur at the wheel once more.
* 2200 dinner finished, her stomach and mind at ease through meal and wine she sends for the chauffeur and heads home to begin it all once more.
I do love watching Alexis, her routines are my routines. My retinal clock flashes:
**17:00**
**17:00**
**17:00**
""Work...how I detest when you interrupt my subtle games"" I mutter to myself as Alexis walks into the Temple.
She sets down her bag and walks to the altar of fire just as she always does. Her scarf unravels as she takes off her jacket and sets it aside.
The beauty of churches...so many rituals to follow. I release my grip and fall from the rafters, my stiletto plunging nicely into the soft of the back of her skull. She slumps: dead in an instant. The chauffeur screams and I idly wonder if they were lovers as I pull a small silenced pistol from my chest harness and put him down.
______________________________________________________________
""Two? Already?""
""Yes, you'll have the location as soon as you make the transaction."" I reply
""Or I could wait...and let you hang for your crimes.""
Zephyr can be such an asshole sometimes.
""No no, you wouldn't do such a thing. You like me FAR too much for that.""
""Check your accounts. Goodbye."" and the line goes dead.
I watch from the alcove of a nearby building as a small army of bots arrives outside the temple. Like so many ants they collect and clean. Scurrying too and fro in an effort to make things right.

""Your first delivery last week was quite difficult. Were you showing off?"" asked Zephyr as she twirled a pen on the table. Her pen is oh so like my stiletto, though it draws ink instead of blood; they're both guilty of so many things.

"""You know what I don't get?""
""What's that?""
""If these dicks all have invented or discovered time travel, why do they all seem to come to the past?""
""Because that's when history happened, Delta.""
BANG
""Nice shot, Beta. I just mean that they can travel to any point in the past, present, or future, and they always seem to choose here, now, April 30th, 1945. Whoa, watch that one.""
BANG
""Got him. I think it's because most people in the future learn of the things this guy did, and try to stop them from happening.""
""They really don't get how time works, do they?""
BANG
""What do you mean by that?""
""Think about it, Beta. We have no idea how time travel works until it actually happens and someone has changed something.""
""…I'm still not sure I follow.""
""Oh for the love of…""
BANG
""Okay, Beta. Let's say I go back in time to kill this guy we're guarding as a baby. Instead of killing the baby, they just switch it with another baby. They go back to their time only to find that the baby grows up to be the guy anyway.""
""With you so far, Delta.""
""OR let's say I went back in time to kill my grandfather. I kill him, but I also prevent my own birth, thereby preventing me from killing my grandfather, so I never go back in time to kill my grandfather, so that all just creates an infinite loop of me killing, but not killing my grandfather.""
BANG
""A little confusing, but I still follow.""
""And the last way is I go back and kill both my grandparents. But nothing happens, because I just created another reality. History continues, and I can't return to my original time. I've just created an alternate timeline in the multiverse.""
""Multiverse…I haven't heard that term before.""
""That's because the multiverse theory doesn't appear until 1957.""
""How do you know…wait, why're you pointing your gun at…""
""Sorry, Beta.""

"I always feared death. That is, until I died myself.
All these years, I gave every ounce of strength just to fight the disease. Hell, even the doctors were amazed at how I could survive for two years after I was diagnosed by Stage IV lung cancer.
""Miracle,"" I often heard them whisper to each other.
But in reality, it just scared the living hell out of me to die. I mean, what would happen to my daughter? I can't just leave her alone. It would be so selfish. I think of my child, who just started schooling. She'll grow up without a dad.
Who would help her with her homework? Who would be there to read her bedtime stories every night just so she could fall asleep? Who would keep on telling her that her mom isn't really gone but she just traveled way up into the sky to watch over us? My heart crushes at the thought of her. She'll grow up an orphan.
My baby Bela, clutching her favorite stuffed toy in her tiny hands. *All alone. *
I remember the day that I gave it to her. Also my first paycheck from the firm. I was so happy to be living off my own hard work that I went straight to the toy store to give her something. She named it Hello. And no, it was not a Hello Kitty. It was one of those minions from Despicable Me that had the word ""Hello"" written over its shirt, hence the name.
She means everything to me. The way her face lightens up whenever I tell her something funny, or when we watch cartoons together, or when we devour our favorite ice cream. She was like a Fourth of July fireworks spectacle that only ended whenever she gets scared that Dora the Explorer was turning into a mermaid and she would start crying.
Every day with her is a constant reminder that is, and always will be the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
That's why I always pictured that I can't die. Not today. Not ever. I think it was my adrenaline that fights off the cancer. Ever heard of how we could basically do anything if we just focus hard enough on doing said thing? I concentrated damn hard on surviving. On living, not leaving.
Wednesday came, and I was still the helpless, semi-dead, motionless pile of crap engulfed in the hospital bed that I may have pissed on. I felt repugnant.
""Mr. Stone, might I have a word with you?""
It was Dr. Perry. He was one of those doctors with the reassuring smiles that seemed to tell you that everything was going to be fine.
That Wednesday, he was not wearing one of those smiles.
I stared at him for a long time, eager to squeeze something out of him that didn't need to be spoken. That's how I examined witnesses during trials. That's how people are, give them a cold hard stare and they give off clues about and I didn't need words coming out of their mouths to know. Based on their fidgeting and the sweat running down their necks, I instantly knew whether they were telling the truth or not. That's how I earned the name, ""Male Medusa"". Said that I could turn anyone into stone just by looking at them. Fitting, for my name.
""What is it, doc?"" I gave up looking at him. This wasn't a trial. I can't win this.
""I regret to inform you, Mr. Stone, but the cancer has spread all throughout your body. How you withstood the cancer always astounded us, but we knew that this was inevitable. Your parents have decided to take you off life support. They can't pay the bills, and they said that neither could you,"" the doctor said grimly.
***No, *** I thought. I can't.
""Your daughter is here to see you.""
With that, I push myself up. I tried to stand, but I stagger, and Dr. Perry sits me down.
""Mr. Stone, please, I'll bring her to you. No need for that,"" said Dr. Perry as he walks out of the room and comes back a few seconds later with a little girl no more than two feet with a yellow toy squeezed tightly in her arms.
""Bela.. Come her and give your old man a kiss,"" I say weakly, the words barely escaping my mouth.
She runs towards me and climbs up into the bed, and kissing me in the forehead.
She lays down beside me and holds my hand. Life will only be good with her on my side. I think she's asleep.
""Doc, do it. Now.""
Doctor Perry responded with a look. I know he understands.
""But Mr. Stone, your parents --""
""Please, call me Xavier. And I don't want my parents here. I don't want them waking Bela up. This is my last request, Dr. Perry. Help a dying man out?""
He hesitated at first, then he taps me on my shoulder.
""I hope it has been a good life, Mr. Stone. I mean, Xavier,"" he said.
I look at my daughter for the last time.
""Its never been this good, Doc."" I smile.
She was the last thing I saw. My eyes closed automatically, and I felt like I was flying. Damn, I thought. Death was a better drug than any combined. I feel the softness of her hand leave me, and that was it. For a fraction of a second, I was certain that I was dead.
...
A flash of white light overwhelmed me. I was in a daze. I felt unsteady, but soon, I realize that I could open my eyes.
My surroundings are starting to form into something. A room.
*Wait. *
I've been here before.
But I can't move. I see the room, its familiar atmosphere. The pink bed and the drawings taped on the wall. A picture of a man and a little girl in a fairy costume.
I look down, and I recognize what I'm wearing. ""Hello"", my shirt says.
The door opens. I see her.",0
"Aug 8, 2034
Dear Son,
It is with a heavy heart that I write you these letters. You are not born yet, but already you are a man in my eyes. I imagine your hopes becoming reality, your hard work paying dividends. Success is what I always wanted for you. A long, happy life.
I'd always wanted a son. I never imagined the hard times—who does? I instead imagined all the clichés: games of catch, talks about girls, sessions in front of the mirror as I teach you how to shave. I wanted you beside me as we traded thoughts on life with a couple of fishing poles in our hands. Sadly, this will never come to pass.
I thought I was done crying, but here I am, bawling like a doomed man. That's okay, son. Men cry sometimes, and that's okay. But I can't continue this right now. My regret, my utter disgust, is threatening to overcome me and I have to put this aside for now.
Thinking of you,
Your Father
& nbsp;
Aug 9, 2034
Dear Son,
I cannot tell you how bleak my horizon is. I cannot ask you to understand the depths of my suffering. It's been only two weeks now since doctors discovered the cause of my growing pain and looming dementia: an infectious prion, source unknown. I have a mutation of a spongiform encephalopathy never before seen. It's lucky that I can write you at all. In mere days I would be reduced to a babbling mess of a human, and frankly that scares me to no end. It's okay to be scared, son.
But that's all I want to say about that. I'm not looking for your pity. All I have for you is love, and that is all I ask from you in return, even if that is something I do not deserve. I would hope that one day you would forgive me for not being there for you.
I write to you from a place of pure love, even if you never get these letters. You are doing more for me than you will ever know.
With a broken heart and broken mind,
Your Father.

Aug 10, 2034
Dear Son,
Why can't I just say it? Your father is a coward. I am a coward. I love you so much, my unborn son, but I cannot live without you. Please do not blame your mother.
It was an accidental discovery. Something that would've slipped through the cracks were it not for my case. But science has no moral fucking compass and here we are.
Son, your embryonic tissue is the only thing that will save me. It is not a choice you get to make; it is a choice I am thrusting upon you, because I am a coward. Because I cannot live with desiccated mind and body.
I fought myself on this, believe me. I wish I had the *balls* to take my life, but I do not.
Son, I love you. I will always love you.
But I cannot live without you.
\- Your Father.",0
"I hated him nearly as much as I hated myself. Stupid fat Yuki, the type of ham-fisted ball head triple chinned Jap that you see in animes being bullied, rather than in schoolyard brawls beating the shit out of the Gaijin. I didn't choose to be a Gaijin either, the kids here stuck it on like a label and decided never peel it off. I gave up Robbie, except at home, in the classroom, I was punk-Gaijin and *Lo-beh* to my teacher. They've got a real problem with R's and L's on this side of the world.
The three o clock bell couldn't have come faster. Shifting a look over my shoulder, I darted to the school corridor and for the hover board docking bay.
Lo and behold, fat head was waiting with two of his cronies. They stood near the hover board bay gate with arms folded and shark grins adorning their pudgy mugs. Yuki, the one in the centre, wore a black suit uniform with a white shirt that threatened to burst over his stomach. His two pals let their coats hang open and their collars twisted in all sorts of random angles. They were textbook baby Yakuzas and I was having none of it.
""Step off, Yuki. Unless you want Principal Joku down here,"" I said, stopping two feet from the entrance.
Kids began piling through the school doors behind, only to notice Yuki and the Gaijin facing off before joining the crowd.
""Kowai desu ka?""
*Are you scared? *
The twerp knew enough english to make chit-chat, but he chose to respond in Japanese to make a point. You see, in this world you're either Japanese or you're not, and assimilating doesn't allow you to make the cut. I was the sore thumb in a row of neatly curled fingers and in Japan there's nothing worse than standing out. Yuki had taken it upon himself to make sure this problem would go away, and most of the other kids secretly agreed with him. Either that or they were too afraid to help out--experience leant toward the former.
""You're not dumb enough to get kicked out of school? Are you?"" I asked, shifting back toward the crowd.
Yuki inched forward, a giant on the prowl. ""Anata no korosu tsumorida.""
*I'm going to kill you. *
Some of the kids in a rush had poked out from the sides of the crowd and past his cronies, into the docking bay. Now that the gate was open, I could maybe make a run for it.
""Good thing fatsos can't run!"" I yelled, turning and pushing into the crowd.
Yuki jumped for me, I felt a hand grip my bag but was able to shake it off. The kids drifted away, like water separating for the passage of a foreign body. In this case, it gave me more leverage to push into them and keep them in disarray, making the job difficult for Yuki.
His cronies joined the search, chasing for the yells from each student I bumped into. Someone pushed me and I rolled centre circle, only to notice Yuki and his pals on the other side of the students now and fighting to get to me.
I darted into the hover board bay, grabbed my Jetson 220--one of the latest and greatest. It could keep up with motorbikes and clamped your feet in so there was no fall-chance. This board was about as big as my forearm and its width was slightly longer than a skateboard. The jagged edges meant that it could slice grass and other frail material.
The board lit up red from my touch - owner recognition - and clamped me in as I jumped on.
Yuki and his Cronies were through the crowd now and beelining it for the hover board bay gate, no doubt they planned to shut me in.
I grinned at the idiots. There was nothing quite like the thrill, those few moments before the board shuddered to life and blasted from 0 to 100. It's the type of energy that preceedes a lightning strike or the tension that occurs right before elastic snaps. The board levelled out above the ground, thrusters powering on and causing the hair on the back of my neck to rise.
My heart thudded, both from the adrenalin and the thrill of the hoverboard. When I'm on here, I forget who I am, and that there are people like Yuki in the world. For the sixty minute ride home I'm away from Japan, and in my own reality, wherever I want the board to take me is where I go, and there's nowhere out of reach. It's a reminder that bad things are only temporary and that happiness always comes in the end.
I pushed forward with all my strength. The air around me cracked as I zipped out, swerving past Yuki and his cronies. There was a huge dust cloud in my wake, and the group of students were left coughing. I dodged pedestrians like obstacle cones and swung hard right onto a biking lane. And then I was off, my problems at my back and the sunset ahead. But none of it mattered because I was here, happy, on my hoverboard.",0
"I stare at the retreating figure of the witch who had just cursed me.
I feel the cold spread from the lump of ice now in place of my heart.
Did she seriously just do this so I can't love again? Love doesn't create *actual* heat.
""Bitch don't you understand the laws of thermodynamics?"" I shout after her slowly fading form.
I see a minute shrug as she disappears from my eyeline and give out a weak gurgle as I fall to my knees. As the floor rises to greet my face, it occurs to me that she doesn't much understand the laws of biology either.",0
"The doctor always said I had a problem. What they meant by that, I don't think I will ever know. I guess the way I live my life hasn't been entirely right but in the end what can I do? I live how I feel I should and will continue to do so. Unfortunately that type of thinking has placed me in Boarding Group B on American Airlines flight 1321 to Atlanta. Apparently there are people who explain to me what exactly I am doing wrong. Until then, here I am in line waiting to take my seats. After a while I notice a lovely blonde standing a few people in front of me. Maybe I should talk to her. Am I even capable of talking to a attractive woman? I used to think so when I was a bit younger but after several bad rejections I think it would be best to just forget about her. Yet what is this? She begins to show consideration for the family that stands behind and in front of her. ""You all can get in at the same time, I'm by myself and I have no problem letting you guys get situated without me in the way."" She says cheerfully. She is like a breath of fresh air. In my experience, with looks comes arrogance, yet with such a minor yet gracious act she begins to unravel my previous notions. Soon this wonderful creature stands before me. The smell of her perfume is intoxicating, almost to the point where I can't think straight. She hums quietly to her self as she puts on her ear buds. I can hear the muffled music playing from them but the sound suddenly stops after a few short moments. She seems frustrated as she removes her phone from her pocket only to notice that it had died. ""The battery is dead, damn."" She says quietly.
Dammit, I can do it! Say something! ""That sucks."" I say shakily. ""Did you forget to charge it?"" She looks up from the blackened screen in front of her and removes an ear bud. ""Yeah, I guess so."" She says with an awkward chuckle. I finally get a good look at her gorgeous green eyes, spectacular. ""I have a charger for that phone with me if you want to borrow it for a bit before we board, there are still a few more minutes left."" She smiles slightly at my gesture of kindness causing my heart to throb uncontrollably. I can barely breathe. ""Thanks, but no thanks. It's no big deal. I can read on the flight."" She replies. All at once I am crushed. I never expected something so small to affect me so much. I smile back for a moment and return to my thoughts. How can someone in need reject such an offer. She obviously wants to listen to her music, and I have given her an offer that would satisfy her wants, yet she declines. Maybe I was wrong about her. She is just like the rest of them: arrogant, cold, disheartening. Her small and sensual frame must be her only true virtue. Everything she says must be an act of some kind, I know it. I can see it now in that beautiful yet deceitful gaze of hers, shes better than everyone else and she knows it. She doesn't do anything out of kindness but out of pity for those she deems underneath her.
While I drown in anger the plane begins to board. The line slowly moves forward as people ring their boarding passes. The succubus in front of me is next in line. She rings her pass and soon afterwards I do as well. As we walk down the ramp towards the whining engines of the jet liner I realize something. I had almost been taken in by the epitome of what causes me heartache. There is only one thing left to do. I must save others from feeling the same way I do. I can't allow her to sow more and more disdain. She's small, and said she was traveling alone. Once we reach our destination I will become the champion of the heartbroken. I'm sure my hands could fit around that elegant neck of hers quite easily, and due to her serious lack of appreciation for random acts from kind strangers, she is without a phone.
The doctors always said I had a problem.....",0
"When I was young, I was obsessed with lucid dreaming. I would always browse the internet for tips and instructions on how to achieve that coveted state - where one was in full control of a fake reality. I imagined nightly trips to exotic worlds, and a place where I could stand up to the bullies and always, always get the girl.
I gave it up after the first night. Instead of being transported to a beautiful fantasy the beckoned at my every whim, I became frozen in place within my own body, forced to watch as malicious creatures seemed to crawl towards the bed. I felt something sit on my chest, slowly and inexorably exerting pressure. *Oh*. My breathing drew up short. *So*. I felt as if I would throw up. *Slowly*. I could've sworn that I heard a rib crack.
Of course, when I woke up I found that none of those things had actually happened. I was fine, and what I had experienced was simply a side effect of attempting to reach a lucid dream state. Needless to say, I did not try ever again, and slept with my parents for a few weeks afterwards.
I never did forget that feeling of helplessness, though. Watching what was happening, fearing the inevitable, with no power to stop it.
I'm a grown man now. It has been many years since I was last afraid of the dark. Since I last thought of helplessness, and creatures in the night. But now I remember again. Now I am afraid.
It was such an innocent looking thing. A tiny chip. It could've been anything - my optical implant, intelligence enhancement, hormone regulation. In fact, if I were any other person, I probably would've just shrugged it off. But I knew. It could not have been any of those things.
How long had it been there? The question burned in the back of my mind. Who had put it there? What did they stand to gain?
Was my whole life a lie? Did I truly have any free will? How long has this thing been influencing me for? Which decisions were my own? Did I really love my wife? Do I really like my job, my children, my friends?
I have to get it out. I know how; I've done it before with more complex implants. I just need access to my workshop and time.
I'm taking it out tonight.
---
""Tonight"" has come and gone. Chip's still in.
That evening, as I strode through the door in a daze, I came to realization. What if it wasn't just me? What if...it was everybody? What if we were *all* the playthings of some person or group, being directed and nudged towards certain goals? What if they could tell that my little light had gone dark on their screens?
No, it's too dangerous to take it out right away. Not until I know more.

I did some diagnostics last night. The chip definitely is some kind of control apparatus. It gets a little ping from an unknown signal, adjusts dopamine and hormone levels *just so* when the target thinks of something in particular - be it a job, a person, or what-have-you - to influence them into making certain choices. Then, like the good little machine it is, it sends a return 'ping' to confirm success or failure.
I thought of my wife first, fingers trembling on the receiving device that I had built out of spare parts and an old radio.
*Ping. *
My children.
*Ping. *
My job.
*Ping. *
My ambitions.
*Ping. *
The shit I took an hour ago.
*Ping. *
Huh. Must be something wrong with the damn thing.
---
I got the machine working a few hours later. It's still on in my workshop, crackling static every once in a while and emitting a faint light.
I tested it out. I'd rather not talk about the results, but it will suffice to say that a lot of who I am is not entirely my own.
I've spent the last week thinking about it. If someone out there really does control my chip, and potentially others', surely I couldn't do anything about it? Even if I removed mine, I would be stuck in a world where I didn't belong, miserable in an otherwise happy society.
I mean, I'm pretty damn happy, right? My wife loves me, my kids are amazing, and my job pays well. If this is life as a puppet, I can't think of anything I'd rather be.
I'm going to destroy the damn receiver.
I'm going to leave the chip in.
I'm going to try to forget it's even in there.
It's for the best.

"The air raid siren howled into the air, a desperate yet futile plea to the masses scurrying in the streets like deer running from a forest fire. There was no denying it; our annihilation was at hand.
Unfortunately, the time to flee had long since passed. Within minutes the very world around us would be turned to ash, a toxic wasteland branded onto the face of this doomed Earth.
However, during the chaos I did what those around me could not - I remained calm. The will to live burned brightly inside of me, brighter than the nuclear storm that seemed destined to engulf me. Thinking fast, I gutted the majority of my refrigerator and climbed inside.
It was quiet, almost idyllic. In fact it was rather comfortable - up until the bombs fell at least. I don't remember much after that, other than waking up some time after, still encased in my chilled shelter.
You wouldn't believe my excitement and surprise, although, you needn't bother. My glee was very short lived. While I had indeed survived the onslaught of nuclear rain that had washed over me, it seemed that ultimately, one's fate cannot be so easily avoided.
Protruding from my chest was a large, solid carrot.
For several minutes, pain burned through me. I began to feel faint as my crippled body drained into what was destined to be my cold tomb. After a short time, the pain subsided and a feeling of calming warmth washed over me, my vision fading into an unfocussed blur. My eyes began to close, and as I lost consciousness I couldn't help but think...
...I don't even like carrots.",0
"He wondered what his memories hold. He sat beside the machine wandering if he should ever use it. On one hand, he is excited about remembering past experience. The first time he walked, the first time he wrote a code, the first time he found his meaning in life.
However, as a scientist, he could never stop considering the possible negative outcome of reading his own memory. After all, he couldn't pinpoint or possibly knew which memory to read. How could he know which year, which month, which day, which hour, which minute, which second to is the joyful memory he wanted?
What if he memorised the failures? This frightened him and his was already starting to recall the pain. The pain of dislocating his shoulder when he fell down his bike when he was eight. That painful memory lead on to another agonising memory. That test he failed when he was in high school and got taped to the bathroom wall. The dreadful and distressing and horrible and hopeless feelings crawled up his sleeves like the cockroaches that crawled up his trousers on that day in his lonely youth.
He stood up and decided not to use the machine. As he slowly walked out the door and left the room, he began to feel regret. He leaned on the door and started to think. It's odd that he could remember the nightmares so vividly and the most beautiful memories were just like half remembered dream. Maybe it was because it was the pain that made him. If it weren't for the difficulties he faced, he would probably never became a scientist and made this machine.
That machine is his life work. Years of hard work would be for nothing if he never tried it on. He was a scientist after all. Giving up on something just didn't fit the job description. He then thought about the possibilities of avoid unwanted memories. Perhaps if he could program the machine to avoid terrible memories. He was hopeful again.
Suddenly, he felt a sense of discomfort. Perhaps it was because of the long hours he spent on working. Or perhaps it was because he forget to take the pills for his heart. Then he became sure it was his heart because of the pain.
He reached for his pocket and took out a little cylinder container. He stared at the container and wondered why there was a mark of something being ripped off. His hands started to tremble and then dropped his pill. He rushed back in his room and search for a calendar or his cellphone. Anything that shows the date. Then he checked the machine. Quickly, he checked the time log on the machine. It was empty, as expected. But there was a wrenched feeling in his gut. Like his gut was tied and untied over and over and over again. ""What's my name?""",0
"I've been addicted to salt since the butterfly dropped Paris on its heels, my small town is your belly hacked wide open. Public office is a doorstep to insanity, my bruised smart phone case may be replaced using federal funds, I'm waiting in the lobby of a patriarchal badger body that doesn't see me as an unequal. I'm a women inside, I'm not a man. My apology is sincere, the time is right, I'll backpedal on earlier statements, I just needed the moment to address the discrimination within our communities.

"""Well?"" Eli peered over my shoulder as I scanned through my GeoWatch.
""I don't know,"" I said, as I discretely pointed my wrist at the cute girl across the bar. ""This seems kind of... stalkerish."" The watch recognized its target and quickly began sorting through my location history.
Eli pushed at my shoulder. ""Come on, man,"" he said, ""it's pretty ingenious. I mean, it's the perfect conversation starter!"" He hopped up from his bar stool and began a haphazard impression of my pickup skills: ""'Hey there, have I seen you somewhere? Were you at that Barnes and Noble on Fifth Street?""' He reached for his beer glass and chugged it back. ""'Why yes, I like to read as well...""' his voice trailed off as he started laughing uncontrollably. I rolled my eyes.
*Ding! Ding! * A metallic beeping noise indicated that my GeoWatch had finished its scan. I glanced down at the tiny screen. The algorithm had returned 7 matches. ""Holy shit,"" I said out loud, to no one in particular. I scrolled down the list of previous encounters, with the first one beginning...
I nearly spat my drink out. I had to squint my eyes and lean in closer to make sure I read it correctly. *March 15, 2015. * I was only 5 years old, then. What were the odds? I hadn't even lived in the city then, that was back when I lived in Georgia. Even so, there was something else about this particular date that struck a chord; I racked my brain to figure out why, until the obviousness of it hit me like a train: that was the day my dad died.
*Okay, either some asshole just hacked me, or this chick has the worst timing. * Just out of curiosity, I checked the second match. *June 29, 2035. * The day my girlfriend of eight years had broken up with me. *What the fuck!? * I kept scrolling.
*August 13, 2036. * My mom died.
*December 4, 2038. * I got fired from my job.
*July 15, 2039. * I shuddered. That was a particularly bad day--it was the day I tried to kill myself.
*July 16, 2039. * My frustrated sister called me a coward. She never called me since.
Tears started rolling down my face. What asshole would hack my watch like this? Just so I could suffer? I glanced across the bar at that cute girl. Was it her? Was she a friend of my ex-girlfriend's or something, trying to make me feel like shit? I couldn't control myself. I stormed across the bar. ""Hey --"" I began to shout at her.
It seemed as if she had expected me to come. She stood up out of her seat, with an amicable expression on her face, and ambled towards me. ""Thomas,"" she said, in soothing tone that somehow rose above the noises of the bar.
I couldn't see through my tears. ""Did that bitch put you up to this?"" I started to sob.
She shook her head, her face turning to one of sadness. ""Thomas,"" she started. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean for you to get angry.""
""Answer the question!"" I shouted, my fists starting to clench.
""No,"" she said, sternly. ""I didn't mess with your watch. It's accurate.""
""Then who the fuck are you... ""
She smiled. ""Someone who cares about you. Who's always been there for you.""
There was something about her voice, her tone, that made me believe her. My skepticism melted away.
She continued. ""Every time you were hurt, I watched. And I cried."" A single tear rolled down her cheek.
""Are you, like, my guardian angel, or something?""
She chuckled. ""Or something.""
I shook my head. ""It isn't fair, you know. I've had a good life. You can't just judge me by my worst moments. You can't --""
She interrupted me. ""I understand. I understand you've had a great life. I'm happy for you. But I'm sad I have to be here tonight.""
I didn't say anything for some time. We shared a silent moment between us, allowing the background noise of the bar to take over. Something had *happened* inside of me. For some inexplicable reason, I believed everything this girl had told me. And the strangest thing was that I felt at peace. ""So I'm going to die tonight,"" I finally said.
""Brain aneurysm.""
I moved my hands up to my temples. I felt a warmth that I hadn't felt before. ""Is it going to hurt?"" I asked.
She shook her head. ""Not as long as I'm here,"" she said.
""Why the whole trick with the watch?"" I asked. I couldn't help but think that it was all just a setup to get me to talk to her.
""Us angels like to have a little fun every now and then. Although, like I said, the watch was accurate. I *have* been there for you in your worst moments.""
I glanced around the bar, back at my friend, who had already passed out and was drooling on the floor. ""He's going to miss me,"" I said. ""He was there for me, especially when I tried to kill myself."" I turned back to the girl. ""Do I have time to say goodbye, before the aneurysm hits?""
She wore a sad expression. She shook her head solemnly. ""No,"" she said, softly.
My peace was starting to run out. Hot tears rolled down my face. I felt the burden of death right around the corner. I wished now more than anything that I could just rewind the clock, that I never spotted this cute girl across the bar. *But it would have mad no difference. * ""Why not?"" I managed to mumble out between short sobs.
""Because you've already died.""
Darkness came crashing in.",0
"Ricky remembers little of his life before he decided to join the army. His parents were against it, though, that much he's sure of. Everybody was against it. But his will was stronger. He wasn't gonna let the very first nation in the world fall down on its knees in front of the enemy without putting up a fight. He believed he was doing what every young man his age should do, really.
The chances of him coming back were slim and he knew it. If you had asked him, he'd say he wasn't doing for himself and he was right at that. He'd pitch some half-thought speech that he had rehearsed some times before, about the nation and the importance of his duty and how he wouldn't take anything less than a victory for his country. The guys who had a chance to listen to this realized at the time how right he was. He had a point, young Ricky.
Thing is, Ricky's memory of the time before the army was kind of hazy. The training was very intense, every soldier said the same. The army wasn't preparing just their bodies, but their minds, too. And that involved a lot of military drugs; to make sure kids wouldn't freak out in the middle of the battlefield, minimize the ocurrence of shellshock, all that psychological stuff that the government had found a way to deal with.
Of course he remembered his parentes, being a kid, growing up as an awkard teenager and everything. It was just the period right before the army that was a little fuzzy in his mind. He payed no thought to it, though, as none of his friends ever did. His mind was occupied with much more important things. He had lost some friends, he had killed some guys, he had done the whole lot. All in the name of duty. He'd been promoted to sergeant and got some medals along with it. He hadn't been able to talk to his parents, but he was sure they were proud of him, if they were getting his letters. They never got to answer them, since he was always moving from one place to another.
This one day Ricky went to the Major's office to request his vacation, like he would always do. He'd been stationed at the camp for about two months then and had been serving for 3 years without ever getting a vacation. He really missed his parents and his young brother Arthur. The major denied his request, as always; something about lack of manpower, which sounded as bullshit to Ricky. He never questioned it, though, couldn't have. It was the major's word and that was that. He could only come back in a week and ask again, wishing for better luck next time.
But on that specific day, something on the major's office caught Ricky's attention. The newspaper on the major's desk said something about some Arthur Holler, a sixteen year old boy. That could very well be Ricky's brother, he would be about that age then. There was no papers in the army camps, to keep the young killer minds focused on killing, so Ricky had to stole the major's if he ever wanted to read it. And that was exactly what he did. Of course this would have no bigger consequences, even if he got caught.
He read the news with a big grin on his face. It really was his brother, by the likes of it: Arthur Holler, sixteen year old, Old Hamilton High School. Everything was a match. Apparently, his brother became some High School hot-shot. He had made the touch down that got his school the national prize. Ricky was very excited and happy for his little brother. He always knew Arthur was going to be big.
But the excitement went away rather quickly. There was a picture of Arthur holding the cup on the other page. He was next to a guy that looked a lot like Ricky. A lot, except for one little detail. On the guy's arm there was no number, and Ricky had had the inscription ""1005941"" on his left arm since he joined the army. But he had a little scar next to his right eye, the same Ricky had since he fell off his bike when he was just a little boy. And suddenly he got it all. He remembered the scientific experimentation that was going on a little before the war started. The new way of warfare that the army has been developing, according to the news of the time. He realized he wasn't really himself.
He stormed in the major's office, who was already on the phone asking for someone to find him. Ricky demanded explanations. The major said everything would be answered with a file he kept on his drawer. Ricky asked to see it, but the last thing he saw was the metallic colt.45 that the major had as a souvenir. Rick had time to think the gun was too old to fire a bullet before he had hit the ground.",0
"Like every other morning I got woken up by my dog, Max. He certainly knew what to do when he wanted food. I got out of bed and could hear the coffee machine already buzzing as it created my coffee. I went to the bathroom, closely followed by Max, who, obviously as a dog, wanted food. I finished my personal chores and gave Max his breakfast, a nice piece of beef. I was drinking my coffee and walking to the door.
""Hmm, lots of mail today"" I said to myself.
One of the letters caught my attention, it had golden lining and the paper was more like parchment, on the front, my address and a wax stamp saying 'Salve', no idea what that mean however. I opened the letter and started reading.
*Dear Archie*
*He survived*
The handwriting was peculiar, messy, *unclear* is a beautiful sort of way, it was flowing. ""He survived"" I whispered under my breath. I looked at the back of the paper and no return address was there, no send address, just mine, the recipient. I had no clue who survived, or who sent the message. I haven't lost anyone in my family, nobody was in the hospital, I was living a happy life...But I never met my biological father, he had left my brothers, my mom and I on the house and dissapeared when I was born.
After quietly thinking by myself I headed to the post office. I gave them the letter, which had a stamp, no clue if I mentioned that, it had a stamp dating 1796, quite old, I am unsure how it was even sent on todays post. The person on the counter said that letter was left on a letterbox, therefore they dont know who sent the letter.
""Thanks!"" I said and left, the post office once again prooved useless.
I walked back home, the rain had started pouring fast now and I had to protect the parchment paper. I sat on my couch and read the letter again and again, the handwritting was becoming more and more recognisable, the letters more vibrant and so much clearer, ""He survived"" said the voice in my head, ""He survived"", the voices inside my head kept repeating those two words.
It must've been an hour now and the letters were now imbedded in my head, I put the letter down, closed it, and walked off. I did nothing about the letter for the rest of the day.
I went to sleep and the dream fullfilled my question. I was there, reading the letter, as the words were getting clearer, an image appeared on the parchment and I had seen this image before. It was my dad.

"""What kind of Idiot are you? I said give me your fucking wallet, not your cards!"" The gruff voice said. I chuckled, pushing my blond hair back over my shoulder. He moved closer to me, placing a hand on my throat.
""Give. Me. You-"" His eyes rolled back in his head as blood gurgled in his throat. A clean cut went right through his black ski mask, as blood soaked into it. My ace of spades was soaked with blood. The mugger collapsed, trying to breathe as blood pooled onto the ground. I looked at my card, as the blood disappeared. My cards worn edges became flat, meanwhile the card regained it's former shine.

"""So President McCain, what do you think will be the chances for the Republicans in 2016.I mean you have no incumbent, you don't really have a front runner for the Democrats, what do you expect?""
As former President McCain looked into the camera, he had trouble thinking of an answer. He wanted to talk about how the GOP was too divided and how many folks on the religious and conservative right had felt their hadn't been a true conservative in office since Reagan, and even then, no one really knew what he would have done since he wasn't in office for so long.
He wanted to talk about how even with a similar split between far left and moderate democrats, they still were winning due to votes from minorities, as well as riding the fact that they convinced the Soviet Union to hold free elections and let their republics and satellites vote for independence. Never mind that Putin had started wars against Georgia and the Ukraine under a democratic administration. He even wanted to mention how Democratic policies might have led to an 08 financial crisis though saying that would be the equivalent to farting in church.
Of course he could talk about his troop reductions for the Iraq war and his stand against torture, but he still kept some troops there, even if all they did was train Iraqis.
""Honestly Stephen, I think that it'll be interesting. I think we have a good shot. Obama was a fine president. He certainly did get some things done, but I think people will want a change.""
""Yeah I think that people will want that too. Its not like President Obama can run for a third term.""
""We'll you never know, some people say he's sneaky.""
The crowd burst into laughter.
""So is their any candidate you really like. I mean is there anyone who makes you think, well maybe we won't get our ass stomped this time?""
""I think that maybe someone like a Marco Rubio would do okay. The Democrats are just all over the place. Bill Clinton's practically ran for the job since 96 but I think he's too old. I like Bill though. He's a character. I'm kind of surprised Obama beat him in the primary in 08. I'm sure I could have beat him at least.............. But seriously I think Bill is a good man""
""That's right. Ladies and gentleman let's give a hand to former President McCain everyone.""
After the show was done, former president McCain got a call.
""Hello John, It's me Barack. Did you hear the news? President Carter just passed away. I've already called Bush and Cuomo and Gore to come to the funeral down in Atlanta. You are going to come correct?
""Of course Mr. President""",0
"John picked up the little black cat from the street. Her head rolled limply to the side. The car that had hit her hadn't been going that fast. The driver would have only heard a small thud, but the cat was undeniably dead. There wasn't any blood. Surely no creature could just die without any wounds? If she wasn't bleeding then she had to still be alive.
John carried her inside. The cat looked exactly like Trixie, but this couldn't be his pet because Trixie was an indoor cat. She'd never had the slightest interest in going outside. John could have left the front door permanently open and Trixie wouldn't have even considered leaving. So this couldn't be Trixie, no matter how similar they looked. Even though both cats had that same patch of white fur at their throats.
This was just the sort of thing that Trixie would do. She was probably hiding somewhere, making him worry about her while she was napping in a closet, or on a bookshelf. He put the dead cat down carefully and went to fetch a bag of cat treats. Once Trixie heard the rattle of a bag of treats, then she would come running, no matter how fast asleep she was. John walked around the house, going into every room, calling her name and shaking the treats. Trixie didn't come.
He stopped, the bag frozen in his hand, as he saw the corpse again. This was Trixie. She was dead and he'd been an idiot to not recognise her at once. John threw the treats at the wall. Why had this happened? Why couldn't drivers be more careful? People were always speeding along this road and nothing was ever done to stop them. What kind of maniac ran over a harmless cat? He'd kill them, if he ever found out who'd killed Trixie then he'd kill them himself.
But that wouldn't bring his baby back. He picked her up again, cradling her close now that he was sure it was her. In life, she never would have allowed him to hold her this tightly. She should be meowing in complaint, she should be giving him a warning scratch.
""Shh, Trixie, it's ok,"" John whispered, rocking her back and forth. ""It'll be ok.""
If he could just make her comfortable then maybe everything would be alright.
""You know,"" John said, trying to keep his voice calm so that Trixie would know that she hadn't done anything wrong. ""You know, you should put your tongue away. Maybe you'd feel better if you did that.""
Trixie didn't move and her tongue lolled out of her mouth in a way that it never had before.
""Please, Trixie, please, just move a little. We can have tuna for dinner. It's your favourite.""
John held her tighter, closing his eyes as his voice cracked.
""You can have tuna every day. Would you like that? No more dried food? Please?""
But Trixie didn't respond and John knew that she never would. His little girl was gone. She didn't look like herself anymore. She'd stopped being a living thing and now she was just an object that resembled a cat. Her fur was just as soft as it had always been, but it didn't matter anymore. John was alone. Just like he'd been alone before he'd adopted Trixie. He wasn't meant to have friendship or love in his life. He'd never done anything to deserve them. He could barely get on with other humans, why had he ever thought that having a cat would be any different? He'd doomed poor Trixie the second that he'd brought her to his home, because nothing good could come into his life and survive.
He held her until she started to become cold and then kissed the top of her lifeless head. Trixie had been a good cat. He should have taken more care to make sure she never got out. He was going to miss her; the soft purrs when he petted her, the midnight crazies when she ran through the house late at night, the 7am wake up call to let him know it was time for breakfast. No other cat could ever compare to her.
John put her down and went to find a box that he could use as a little coffin.",0
"""That's not quite accurate love.""
She raised an eyebrow. ""How so?""
""While my recollection does stretch back to my time in the womb, I do not recall all of the time in the womb. I do not recall my conception,, or anything that came before it for example.""
She waived a hand in the air. ""Well, surely not. After all, your consciousness must not have developed until your brain had grown to a certain size. The zygote would not have had any organs with which to think or feel. Still, your memory stretches back further than any other person alive.""
""No love. There are those who can recall further back in their lives than I can in mine. I've known people, rare and few, who cannot only recall their conception, but things which preceded it.""
Her jaw slowly dropped open. Her eyes widened until they resembled black saucer plates with brown trim patterns on white table cloths.
He smiled at her. ""Later this week, I shall introduce you to such a person.",0
"""Who the fuck are you and how did you get into my house?"" Lenny said, exasperated and confused as he set down his groceries. ""It's Leonard, right?"" said the stranger, with a blank expression, and just a hair too little of an upward inflection. Lenny reached for the baseball bat he kept by the front door. ""Oh. Leonard, there is no need for violence. I've only come to grant your wish."" ""What the FUCK are you talking about? Who are you? Get the fuck out of my house!"" Lenny pointed the bat at the stranger and then the door. ""Out!"" he roared. ""August 2nd, 1982. You wished for a radio flyer and your parents to stop quarreling all the time."" Lenny's eyes opened wide as he remembered the night vividly. ""It takes about 20 Earth years to travel from my quadrant to twenty-two twenty-two Muskogee Court, but I am here. Here to grant your wish. I couldn't make it in time to stop your parents from divorcing, but please take this wagon as a token of my grattitude."" ""Gratitude?"" Lenny asked. ""Yes. You see. My 'people' need to be invited to Earth in order to make the journey. Your wish served as that very invitation. Not many of us make it."" ""Why do you come here? What's the point?"" ""Oh, resources, to study life,"" the stranger trailed off. ""Too feed."" He said, coldly. Before Lenny could let the words register and send a signal from his brain to his arm to pick up the bat, he'd need swallowed entirely whole.
The end.",0
"You can find them everywhere: in old coat jackets, on gritty parking lot asphalt, bunched together between stitched-together patches of dead flesh. If someone were to hand you one, you wouldn't think twice before you took it. And why should you? It's not like you personally tore the cotton from a bug-infested field, mashed it flat, stained it a dingy green, and painted it with a perfect representation of a dead man. But you did lay our bare, uncovered, unwashed hands upon it--just like millions of people before you, and millions after you. You made an exchange, all right, and it wasn't currency.",0
"""*What do you mean I can't get another refill*?"" I muttered in annoyance. The Dr. Jackson's face was stern and he seemed concerned. What was it? Sixth? Ninth time I've gotten an extension on my sleep meds? I guess I'd be concerned too if I was him.
""*Look, Mr. Davis. I can't give you any more of the medication. It was suppose to be a temporary solution for your insomnia, but a permanent one. Perhaps I could refer you to a pscyh*-"" I sighed and muttered a curse under my breath as I took my coat and left the room. I didn't want to waste more time with him; I had bigger plans for my evening. I headed out the door of the doctor's office and fumbled for my keys as I walked to my truck.
It was about four in the afternoon now, and it'd take me a good hour to get home through rush hour traffic. I rubbed my eyes as I got in the driver seat, thinking about the dreams again. The sooner I get home, the sooner I can get into bed and the sooner I can get back to it. It'll be faster once I get on the highway.
It started about four months ago after the accident at work. Something fell from the conveyors overhead and I was in the way. Out like a light. The first time I was there, it only felt like a couple hours, but even then it wasn't enough. I relived moments from high school but I was doing better than real life though. My grades were great, and I was way more popular. I even got a date to the prom and we were crowned king and queen. It was great to have control of my life, even if it was just a dream. I just thought it was a lucent dream that I've read about. One of those ""once in a blue moon"" thing-
""*SHIT! The Blue Moon Cafe! *"" The small diner swishes by as my left hand flicks the turn signal immediately and I swerve into the lane next to me and onto the off-ramp. The car behind me brakes hard, pounds the horn, and raises his unappreciative finger to me as I wave an apologetic hand back.
It wasn't all the time at first. Tops maybe two or three times a week, but slowly they became more frequent, and after about two months, it was nightly. It was addictive though, like writing my own story of my own epic life. **I started off by going back to high school and finishing it off. It felt great to see old friends again and to show that I was worth something to the teachers. At first I was kinda worried that this was from the injury, maybe bleeding in my head or something. Eventually though, I stopped worrying about it. I enjoyed the dreams, even more than my real life. I had nothing going for me in the real world. My disability pay was barely enough to keep me going, I lived in a small apartment with no family, no girlfriend. Not even a dog. But in my dream world? I was doing great. I rose up through the business world with my Master's degree and created a company worth billions. I had TWO dogs AND an albino lion for pets. I was popular and partied with celebrities every weekend. On Facebook I had like 837 friends.
""*837*,"" I said to no one in particular ""*and that is my exit*."" The traffic had thinned out by now, and I was on the home stretch to getting back to my ""good"" life. Every day I spent awake seemed to drag on now, like distractions from my fantasy world. The meds really helped to get me to sleep, and to keep me asleep, but I guess I'd have to find another way now.
Not only did they start occurring nightly, but the time I spent in my dream world got longer and longer. They were clearer each time too. At first it all seemed fuzzy, and I couldn't hear much. But eventually all the senses came with them. I could hear things clearly, see things in vibrance, smell and taste delicacies. They only lasted Hour at first, but then days, and then weeks. Last night I went for almost a year, and what a year it was. I was doing great in my dream world. I was on top of the world. I was famous, a great political leader, and my empire was rising. A war had started between another country, and I wasn't about to back down. I gave a grand speech to my men as we headed out to the battlefield. Planes boomed overhead as my men marched forward with me in the vanguard in my tank-
The sound of glass breaking and metal tearing made me wince in pain and my ears throb in protest. The truck flew out of my control as the tanker clipped me. My foot stomped on the brakes as I frantically spun the steering wheel to try to maintain a direction. The tires slipped off the road and I felt weightless as my truck flipped over into the ditch; then the world couldn't stop spinning. Everything was airborne inside the vehicle and my body jolted around without bounds aside from the seat belt. The grinding of metal against the ground, the piercing of glass into my skin, the thundering of the cannon shots and the roar of the fighter jets above. The world was dark and cold.
""*Wake up! *"" a voice screamed at me. Eyes adjusting to the light of day again, the wreckage smoldered in the distance. ""*Thank god, I thought you'd gone into a coma there*.""
""*Dr. Jac*kson?"" my trembling voice gasped.
""Sir, I know it is painful, but we need you to get up again.""
""W-what? Why? I-i c-"" I felt like I had a tube down my throat.
""The enemy marches against us in great numbers, the men need you to guide them.""
My eyes widened, and the pain faded a bit, but all my senses came back to me with clarity. I felt alive again.
""I'll lead the charge.""

"I've been trying to sleep. I have to work early tomorrow. If I fell asleep right now, I'd get about, I look at the clock, 6 hours if sleep. I'd have been asleep an hour ago if my FUCKING CAT WOULD SHUT THE FUCK UP! His nonstop meowing was driving me crazy. I let him out, I fed him, I was out of options.
""Just shut up please! Shut up or tell me what you want in English and I'll do it yourself stupid cat!""
""Fine by me, you've got a deal.""
And the meowing stopped.
Wait. I sat up, finally realizing what the hell just happened. I look at my cat and he's sitting there looking at me. Surely it was just my imagination. My cat can't talk. That's dumb.
""I would like you to quit your job and come with me on an adventure.""
Nope. Not my imagination. Definitely heard that. Definitely saw his mouth move. Definitely losing my mind. I stared at him complete dumbfounded. He stared back like I was an idiot.
""Well? Will you do it? Are you gunna go I to work tomorrow and quit?""
""You can talk?""
After a moment of silence he replied ""Uh, yeah, we established that, now back to the point at hand, are you going into work tomorrow morning and coming back jobless?""
""But why would I do that?"" I somehow managed to reply as if it was a normal conversation.
""I know you hate your job, and what have you got to lose? I mean, your cat is talking, so I'm clearly not just trying to get you fired for nothing, obviously there's something more here."" He had a point. But I needed money. I wasn't poor, but I wasn't swimming in it either.
""Fine. When I get back tomorrow, we better be going somewhere exciting."" My cat seemed to smile at this and his tail quickly flicked back and forth.
I cannot believe I actually just quit my job...For my cat. I was driving home after a really awkward conversation with my boss about having to quit immediately because an emergency came up with my pet. I probably sounded like an idiot. Hell I still sound like an idiot to myself. But I swear if that cat was lying to me I'll see him to some Chinese restaurant. I pulled into my driveway and he sat on my windowsill watching me. I walked in my house and he greeted me like normal, brushing up against my legs. I got changed and he still acted normal. I was worried I just quit my job over a bad dream I had.
""Well, what this big adventure you talked about?"" I asked him, a little upset.
""Don't worry, she'll be here soon. When the lady gets here, we'll be on our way to the greatest adventure you've ever had!"" So at least I wasn't insane. I mean maybe I was, but I was either insane and didn't need to be working at a normal people job, or my talking cat wasn't just a figment of my imagination.
""What lady is this that we're waiting for exactly?"" I didn't notice the small dark spot in the corner of the living room. The growing shadow despite the big open window. The figure climbing out of the shadow as if it was a hole. I was looking the other direction at my cat. He stared right past me and didn't even reply.
""Hello!?""
""Hello."" That was not my cat's voice. That voice was raspy, feminine, and came from behind me. I spun around to see the woman appear as if a shadow had materialized and manifested into a physical being. Her skin was grey, her hair, eyes, dress and...Smoke/essence/aura that seemed to emit from her was all black.
""That lady."" My cat said snidely.",0
"The sound shattered a universe. Steel twisted and bent, the chassis collapsed, and the front windshield ruptured. It was like God had taken my car and crumpled it between His hands.
I opened my eyes.
I hadn't been showered in shattered glass. My chest hadn't been cored by a steering column. I could feel my hands and toes and neck. And all I could see was...leather? Leather, and a hemisphere of white plastic.
Slowly, achingly, I pulled myself backward. I was sitting in my backseat--how did I get here?--and had ended up with my head shoved against the leatherette exterior of the front driver's seat. The car was reasonably intact, considering. The windshield was indeed gone, but the front of the car had collapsed almost perfectly, preserving the interior. And me.
I could see an arm in a white suit, and white gloves, holding firmly onto the steering wheel.
""Hello? Who are you?""
The hemisphere of plastic turned. I saw my own face, shocked but unmarred, in the reflection of a mirrored visor.
I wish I could tell you what we talked about. I wish I could remember. But I was in such a daze from the impact that I don't remember much. And what I do remember would sound unbelievable if I told you.
All I know for sure is, he's called the Stig.",0
"...
...
She was shaking, I was too, he was dead. Blood on my hands, I hoped there was still light behind my eyes. I never killed a man before, I never had to save someone before. I didn't feel good, or mighty. She broke, slumped to the ground, her body, a tremor as she sobbed. I dropped the knife, I turned to look at what I had done. She shouted my name through tears. He had so much red on his stomach, his throat was open too. I did that? I did that, I had to. I said as much out loud. Again she shouted my name. I couldn't touch her though. She is so white, and I haven't decided if now I am dark. I didn't feel tainted, my heart was still beating so fast. I took a long hard breath, he is dead and so is his intent, we are alive because I would not allow him to have his way. Again she shouts, but I'm deep in thought. Another long breath. I came to a conclusion. I killed a man today, I did the right thing, I beat him to the punch, and I'm still here and I still have to take care of her.
I told her to stand, nicely, I offered her a meek smile, and apologized for what she had seen and what I had to do. I started to explain why, but fuck it, she can't hear anything, *she's in shock Boone, get her inside*. I walk her up the street, she remembers she can't walk in heels. She sees the life on my hands, and that sets her off again. We go inside a shitty mexican restaurant. I sit her down, I go to wash my hands. I do it with my closed, I'm not sure if I wanna look at the guy who looks back at me above the sink. I'm not sure if I wanna be the voice on the phone to the police. I puke in the sink, maybe some got on my shoes.
What the hell am I doing?",0
"What a fantastic end to the night. Downtown always looked best after dark and the snow fall added just the right amount of contrast to the scene. It was my annual Christmas office party and we had just left the venue. As I opened the cab door to let my wife in she smiled at me and I thought for the hundredth time how right she was about not driving here. We knew it was an open bar and we decided to just be safe about it.
We were sitting in the back seat as I went over all of the office gossip about the people I had just introduced her to when she picked her head up my shoulder.
""What is that guy, drunk?"".
I looked up just in time to see a pair of headlights swerve from the oncoming lane and into ours.
Everything was dark, well almost everything. Two glowing ovals floated in space right in front of me. On the left one of them read 'New Game+', and on the right the other said 'Exit to Reality'.
""What the hell is this?""
I was just in a car with my wife, but now...where the hell am I? I tried to search around but there was nothing else here and no matter which way I looked those two buttons were the only things I could see. It occurred to me that we must have been hit by that other driver. I've read before that when people have traumatic things happen to them their brains come up with elaborate scenes to process the information. This must be what my brain came up with instead of a tunnel of light, like this was all just some kind of video game.
I immediately dismissed the option of ""Exiting to reality"". If this was my life's version of the tunnel of light then there was no question, I was walking away from it. The sense of panic started in my heart and lit my entire body on fire in less then a second. My arm flew up and selected the other option without any more thought, I had to make sure she was OK. I couldn't waste anymore time here, I *had* to know what happened. The sign lit up, letting me know that I had made my selection. As my arm came back down to my side something occurred to me ""Shouldn't that say 'Continue""'?
I blinked and then I was surrounded by darkness, I knew I was opening my eyes but it didn't do any good there was nothing to see. I could feel my body again but I couldn't move. I heard some strange noises coming from outside, but they were distorted like they was coming through a thick wall.
I thought right away that the car had been crushed and that I was stuck inside and upside down. The accident must have been bad. There was a pushing down near my feet and feeling that I was moving, slowly toward something. Then came the unbelievable crushing pressure on my skull, like it was in some kind of vice that squeezed down on it from every angle at once. I wanted to scream but my chest was paralyzed and there was no air in my lungs. ""Oh God! What is this? What is going on?"" The sensation that I was being pushed slowly through this coffin continued as I struggled to move my arms so I could create some amount of space for my self.
Then I saw the light. It wasn't the pleasant feeling of safety you get when you finally find the lamp in a dark room. It was a searing pain that shot through my eyes and stabbed into every corner of my brain. I could finally breath now, and I could finally scream. I risked opening my eyes again just for a second, just to see if I could figure out was going on. I saw men surrounding me, pulling me out of something. I knew that they must be the EMT's. They must have arrived in time to get me out of the wreck and I have never been happier to see another living being. I couldn't keep my eyes open for long though and the pain forced me to squeeze them back shut on reflex. I felt my arms and legs flailing around now kicking at nothing but air. I was finally free.
My entire body hurt like nothing else I had ever felt. I can't stand any kind of light and even when I get up the nerve to open my eyes again I can't see more then two feet in front of me. I can't control my arms or legs and I although I am aware of people talking, their sounds they are making don't make any sense. I must have a really bad concussion. I think my skull is broken. As my body is wrapped from head to toe in a warm blanket, I finally feel that I can pass out. Just before I do a thought finds its way into my mind; I'm six foot four, how fucking big is this monster that is now holding me?
A new bubble pops up in front of me: ""Achievement Unlocked: Forever Reincarnated"" The smaller text below it says: ""Respawn to this world 100 times."". What the hell does that mean?",0
"""Life isn't quite fair, is it? For us to end up this way."" Said one hobo as he sat down next to a travel worn man with a beard under a bridge.
""It is what you make of the gift you have been given."" replied the travel worn man.
""But is it? There is so much injustice, won't you share a drink with me?"" as the hobo hands out a bottle of dark liquid.
""There is a time and place for alcohol my son, and this be not it.""
""Well, how about hitting this crack pipe then my friend?""
""My son, these substances you use will only confuse you further. They will not illuminate the path you must take to find the light"".
""You sure, its *really* good"" as the hobo offered out a fat lump of crack and sparked a butane torch.

""Alright. Is *everyone's* phone on silent this time?""
Jenny shuddered, remembering her first trip with the group, only yesterday, involving an escaped tiger and an angry elephant. Set off by a blaring ringtone.
""Okay, good."" Jenny snapped her head back up, trying to seem like she had been listening. It was no use. Charlotte gave her a long look.
""Jenny, you're with me,"" the group's 'leader' continued. ""Everyone, get into your pairs and lets go.""
Automatically, the huddle of 8 girls split into four pairs. Jenny felt Charlotte yank at her arm.
""What was her name again?"" Jenny asked quietly, pointing to the tall girl with red hair lounging absent-mindedly against the solid stone wall of the museum.
""She's Nikki...but it doesn't matter for now, we'll be just on our own for this mission. Chin up, Newbie, you'll learn everyone's names soon enough.""
*Mission, * Jenny thought to herself. *More like Death Wish. * She berated herself for joining the rag-tag team. All because she wanted to fit in in her new school.
Jenny brushed the hair from her eyes and looked around- had the older girl...Charlotte...left her? Her eyes caught on the familiar figure standing tucked against a dimly lit staircase, motioning for her to follow.
They walked in silence, the distant buzz of fluorescent lights the only noise to be heard. Charlotte turned to face the new-recruit.
""How old are you? I never asked...""
""Um, 14,"" Jenny said, tugging awkwardly at the sleeves of her hoodie. The rest of the gang seemed older- would Charlotte laugh at her for being so young?
Jenny's mentor only nodded wisely. ""I was that age when I joined. I'm only 16 now. And I've been here the longest."" Jenny felt a little weight lifted off her shoulders.
""Really?""
""Yeah. And Miranda was only 15.""
Jenny shuddered. *Was*. All she knew about 'Miranda' was that her position was suddenly empty- and Jenny had filled it. There was no doubt that Miranda had died during one of the gang's so-called missions.
Charlotte thrust an arm out in a 'stop' signal, interrupting Jenny from her thoughts. She had just enough time to mutter 'what the...' before the older girl clamped her hand over Jenny's mouth.
""Warden..."" Charlotte hissed. The pair watched in concentrated silence as a fat man in uniform wandered past, swinging torch from side-to-side lazily.
Jenny let a second pass before she allowed herself to breathe. They were in the Lockhart Museum, home to the world's most famous pieces of art...and the exquisite ancient chinese urn that the girls were about to steal.
*No laws for us. We can do whatever we want...* Jenny reminded herself, repeating the thought like a mantra in her head again and again. It didn't help to stop the niggling worry in the back of her mind. *But that doesn't mean the electrified security systems are disabled...*
---
Charlotte and Jenny worked in silence, sawing- quiet as a mouse- through the cables. They were the thickest cables Jenny had ever seen, and wire cutters seemed useless to them. The two of them had resorted to the little saw on Charlotte's pen-knife, each taking over when the other got tired. They were making progress, but slowly.
""Charlotte,""
""Mmm?"" Charlotte continued to saw, beads of sweat forming on her temple. They were pressed for time, and they both knew it. ""If you're about to say 'saw faster' don't.""
""I won't!"" Jenny exclaimed under her breath, scared to talk at normal volume after a run-in with the mechanical attack dog roaming the halls. '*Security measures these days...* Charlotte had remarked. ""It's just. Charlotte is a bit of a mouthful, don't you think?"" Jenny swallowed. *Please be cool, please be cool...oh god I'm trying too hard...She can tell...* ""Sh-should I call you Charlie instead?""
Charlotte gave her a dark glare. ""No. Absolutely not."" She picked up the saw and handed it to Jenny. Her hands were red and raw, but the cable was almost done. ""Here, your turn. You can do the last bit..."" the teenager took a swig of water from her water bottle. ""*Never* call me Charlie, okay? That's a name for try-hards trying to look tough. I'm naturally awesome, I don't need some shitty nickname based in my insecurities.""
Jenny took in Charlotte's cropped hair, dyed a shocking blue colour. *She's right, * Jenny thought to herself. *She doesn't need a nickname to be cool, she's so badass already...*
Jenny looked down at the cable. With one last drag of the saw across the hardened wiring, it broke in half.
""Finally!"" Charlotte turned to Jenny and winked. ""Action time, rookie.""
---
Nikki and a girl with gorgeous dark skin were already waiting by the glass case of the urn. From behind a corner, Jenny could see the guard's limp body and dark red blood pooling out from below.
*Thou shalt not kill, * echoed the theology teacher's words in her head. Something told Jenny that these girls probably weren't religious.
Nikki nodded to the body. ""We dealt with *this* chump. But the dog is still out there. We better hurry.""
From out of nowhere, more of the gang appeared and converged around the glass.
""Geez, is that all?"" asked one girl, blonde dread-locks spilling out from her rainbow beanie. ""Doesn't look all too worth it.""
Charlotte folded her arms. ""Trust me, girls. This one is worth it. *5 million credits* kinda worth it.""
Jenny gasped, and the blonde girl's eyes grew wide.
""5 million!? For *that*?"" she said, waving her fingers towards it, careful not to set off the heat sensors. ""It's so *ugly*,""
""Well, tell that to the collectors,"" Charlotte replied, gesturing to the dark-skinned from earlier. ""Jane, if you will,""
""Certainly,"" the girl winked. With one graceful motion, she unhooked a small device vaguely similar to a breathalyser from her pocket and clicked it together with a device she had procured from the guard's pocket.
She sauntered over to the case and the girls parted. Nikki pulled out an aerosol can and sprayed it around the casing as 'Jane' slipped on gloves.
With a sly smile, she pushed the machine against the glass and it let out a low buzz. The glass melted away, dripping like tiny hot raindrops.
""Be careful,"" Charlotte started, but there was no need. The girl had finished melting the glass and had gently lifted the urn from it's stand, replacing it with a small weight.
A mechanical whirr started in the background, followed by a robotic bark. The lights flickered on, illuminating the dark room.
""That's our cue to leave,"" Charlotte grinned, turning on her heels and motioning for the others to follow as the loud drone of alarm bells began to sound.
---
Jenny crawled back into her bedroom window, exhausted. Flashes of the mission whizzed through her brain, still crackling with fresh excitement. Nikki lighting a flare and rolling it into the corridor as the building echoed with footsteps...The gang piling into a car and screeching into night...Charlotte shaking her hand and driving away with the urn, ready to sell it on, leaving Charlotte alone and tired in the dark outside her suburban house.
A light flicked on. Jenny jumped.
""Just what do you think you're doing, young lady?"" boomed Jenny's dad. Her mother came dashing in, face stony. ""Sneaking out late at night? There's been a robbery at the museum! One of those gangs- think about it, Jennifer, you could've been hurt! If you had run into those *criminals* no doubt you would be dead! Think about your poor mother! We had no idea where you were!""
""I --""
""No, I don't want to hear it. The damage is done."" He took a step away from Jenny. ""There may be no laws regarding youths like you, but we are still your parents, and we make the rules. You're grounded. You will never be so reckless ever again, you hear me?""
Jenny pretended to pout as her parents exited the room in a swirl of rage and stern disappointment. Jenny tucked her head into her pillow, grinning.
*If only they knew...*",0
"The morning was overcast, a confusing illusion of alternating brights and darks that made everyone waking up straighten in panic at the *afternoon light* shining through their window. The first licks of fall crisp peppered at the window of a taxi puttering through crowded streets, stray medleys of red and golden leaves crackling under the tires'tread. Inside it a woman was adjusting her corrective lenses, craning her neck over a slight stain on the passenger seat in front of her to peer out ahead.
""Turn here, please?"" She asked.
The driver nodded, making a sharp right in to the entrance of an alley lined with multistory layers of graying brick and concrete.
""How much?"" She inquired, opening the gleaming black leather of her handbag.
""Twenty-two,"" huffed the driver, ""but this isn't where you wanted to go, ma'am.""
""It's fine,"" she said, handing him a bill.
From outside, someone would have seen two things of interest: a middle-aged woman wearing business attire stepping awkwardly out of a taxi, preparing to carry her handbag and a single briefcase in to the shaded uncertainty of a Chicago back-alley; a taxi driver, staring equally with suspicion and shock at a fresh one-hundred-dollar bill.
""Ma'am,"" the driver said with annoyance, ""this is too much. I can't break this.""
""Oh,"" she said, adjusting her glasses again to peer at the bill, ""is that a bad thing?""
The driver thought about this. His conscience wrestled with his suspicion, until avarice jumped in to the fray and stole the victory.
""No,"" he said, ""that's fine. Have a pleasant day miss...miss...”
The woman opened the handbag with a flicking wrist, briefly glancing at its contents. The driver's face fell by a fraction of an astronomical unit.
""Mrs. Scharre,"" she said, closing the handbag. ""Have a niceness day.""
Mrs. Scharre winced at the linguistic error, closed the door, and walked off at a brisk *step-step-wobble-step*. The driver took no notice, and sped off before she changed her mind.
Ten minutes later Mrs. Scharre was sitting at the end of a conference table, unclasping her briefcase and spreading its contents on its laminated surface in neatly ordered stacks. It spanned nearly the length of an intensely lit room within the fourth floor of a wan office complex. Sitting to her left, a man in a gray jacket with brown hair on its way to silver leaned in closer to her.
""They're late,"" he covertly whispered, ""again.""
She stopped, considering this, and continued her preparations.
""They are consistent,"" she said with a monotone, ""and that is what I like.""
The office's double doors opened with a hollow creak. A casually dressed man with a tan messenger bag strapped to his shoulder peered in and around the inside.
""You're Mrs. Scharre, right?"" The newcomer asked, his sharp eyes darting between the two.
""Yes,"" she said, not looking up.
""Awesome,"" he said, ""I'm Tony. We spoke on...”
""I'm aware of who you are,"" she interrupted, ""take a seat in the appropriate place.""
She blinked, stopped her shuffling, and gave a quick side-long glance to the man on her left, and then Tony. Tony cocked an eyebrow, and sat on the opposite side without comment. She cleared her throat, and began to read from a thick pile she'd made to her right. The man to Mrs. Scharre's left stood up, leaning over the table to extend a hand.
""Don't mind her,"" he apologized, ""she's grumpy in the morning. I'm Gary.""
""Glad to meet you,"" Tony said, returning the hand with a firm shake.
They sat retook their seats. Silence ensued, broken only by the turning of Mrs. Scharre's pages.
""So,"" Tony awkwardly offered, ""is there anyone else coming?""
Gary glanced at a watch on his wrist.
""Any minute now, but we can start. First I'll need you to sign some...”
Mrs. Scharre's hand shot out in front of Tony with a packet. She dropped it, and went back to turning.
“...Things. A non-compete, non-disclosure – basically everything we need to save our collective skins."" He finished, casting her an annoyed look.
Tony blinked. He blinked again.
""She was serious about the,"" Tony said, adding air quotes to, ""*alien* thing?""
""We have considered our options, and it's been unanimously decided among us that a story about extra-terrestrial contact would adequately draw attention away from our business interests. We've also decided that your affiliations with multiple media outlets in addition to your popularity as a public figure will make this possible."" Gary said.
Tony waited for the joke's punchline – maybe a camera crew to pop out. Nothing happened. He bit his lip, and tapped a finger on the table in thought.
""Does a position with our organization still interest you?"" Gary asked.
Tony's face fixed in to a contemplative mask. He looked at Mrs. Scharre, at the packet she held, at Gary, at the papers turning in her hands, and...
Tony's face became a mixture of puzzlement, and uncertainty. Gary - noticing the change – tracked his gaze across the table to his right, up to Mrs. Scharre's hands, the pages fluttering in precise motions, and her eyes darting across their surface with alarming speed. His smile also transformed – in to dumbfounded panic.
""Judith,"" he said quietly, ""what are you doing?""
""Reading,"" she said, with a tone that suggested this should be obvious.
""Judith, you are aware the pages are upsidedown,"" he said in low tones, ""aren't you?""
She stopped reading, and closed her eyes in concentration. As if with effort, she blushed.
""I like to keep sharp,"" she said, opening her eyes and staring evenly at Tony, ""but if it bothers you, I will cease to do so.""
""That's incredible,"" Tony said in awe, ""like the scary kind of incredible. Count me in!""
Gary let out the breath he'd held in a noiseless *whuff*.
The door opened with a loud thud as two more figures walked in. The tallest of the two – long multicolored knit scarf twirling behind him as he walked in as a neon blur of tracksuit – wordlessly took a seat to Gary's left. He was balding, somewhere in the confident highground of his thirties. The other's age could only be guessed. Covered from head to toe in multiple layers and colors of winter clothing only appropriate for an arctic climate, the ageless brunette took a seat to Mrs. Scharre's right. In unison, they turned their heads and beamed at the stunned Tony.
""Right,"" Tony said to Gary after a long pause, ""intelligence and eccentricity go hand-in-hand, I guess.""
Gary winced, and managed a blank-faced, ""They very much are – to my left is Mr. McReady. To Mrs. Scharre's right is Ms. Palmer.""
The two, in perfect unison nodded and without a single pause said, ""Hello Tony it is a pleasure to meet you welcome to our humble office in downtown Chicago, Illinois.""
Mrs. Scharre looked up abruptly. Ms. Palmer, and Mr. McReady buried their toothy smiles under six feet of cement, and sat back in their chairs.
Gary, sweating slightly from the spectacle, addressed Tony with forced formality, ""I'll give you a brief overview of our problem.""
""Alright,"" Tony said, seemingly amused, ""lay it out for me?""
Gary nodded.
""We have had the benefit of greased wheels with respect to regulations that would otherwise restrict our interests in the harvesting and resale of lumber in and outside of British Columbia. That is going to change fairly quickly – it's been discovered that a large oil reservoir is buried there, and we intend to use it. Our efforts will inevitably suffer once this information spreads. And it will spread – quickly. Our sales within the United States make up the bulk of our revenue, and where most of our opposition will come from. Mrs. Scharre has alerted me to a very convenient explanation for the deforestation, and inevitable contamination of that entire area – that we are a cover up of a larger goal by prominent citizens within our government to search out, capture, and stem the tide of a hostile extraterrestrial species that has begun to colonize the area. We need you to make sure there are enough people here who believe this that any opposition will be met with resistance. Everyone will eventually forget, and we'll all walk away richer.""
""That's it,"" Tony snorted, ""that's your big plan?""
Gary smiled.
""No,"" Gary said with a wink, ""That is *your* big plan.""
Tony sat in stunned silence.
""I...I'll see what I can come up with,"" he said, mouth dried to a desert wasteland.
Gary reached over to shake his hand, and said, ""Mrs. Scharre will assist you with your paperwork. I'm overdue for a lunch meeting, so I will leave you in her...their capable hands."" He said, reluctantly including the two anomalies.
Tony shook his hand, ""Thank you, I look forward to working with everyone.""
Gary left. The door snapped shut.
Mrs. Scharre slowly looked up at Ms. Palmer, and Mr. McReady. Something silent and chilling passed between them. Mr. McReady spooled his scarf around his neck, rose up out of his seat as if gravity had no place in his immediate lifestyle, walked smoothly to the doors and with a loud click they locked from the inside. He took up a defensive posture in front of the double-doors, and smiled. Mrs. Sharre's hardened gaze turned on Tony.
""Paperwork…"" she intoned with all the mirth of a funeral march.
Tony reached in to his bag, grabbed a manilla folder, and with a half-cocked smile slid it over to Mrs. Scharre. She reached out, flipped it open and began reading it all within the same blur of motion.
""All of you need more exposure,"" Tony said, ""because that was terrible.""
Ms. Palmer started to let out a series of whistles, clicks and polyphonic hoots but Tony cut her off with a glare.
""No,"" he said, ""From now on, you speak like them.""
""Is the crash-site safe?"" Asked Mrs. Scharre.
""Yup,"" said Tony, ""and any others can land where they like. Once they're cloaked from view, the ship's landing sites will just appear to be deforested sections.""
Tony surveyed the room with an imperious sweep, and said, ""Phase two can begin as soon as this charade gets underway.""",0
"""Wire me to any patrol bots near the crime scene."" I said, as i prepare to connect to investigate a case of murder. Not any ordinary murder, but one of the famous Oscar winning actor, Sebastion Jones.
""Detective Alex Burton, LAPD."" I said to the officer at the scene. After being let into the crime scene, I immediately look for any evidence. I immediately spot a puddle of oil on the ground, confirming my deepest worries. A robot did this. I sighed, this is going to be one hell of a case.
After thanking the officers at the crime scene, I disconnected from the patrol bot. In order to gather more evidence, i will have to head down to the crime scene myself.
This murder was unlike any others. The scene was clean. I've been on the force for 31 years to see multiple thousands of murder cases, this is the cleanest murder yet. There were no traces, no fingerprints, no murder weapon and no motive of murder to be found anywhere at the crime scene. This was a professional job. Someone who had done this before.
""Sir, we found something"", a young officer with holding a transparent plastic bag said as he approached me. The bag seems to have some opaque brown liquid in it. ""Whats this?"" I asked. ""Type 18 Oil"", he replied. ""And how is this evidence?"" I asked, puzzled. Ever since the introduction of Human-Controlled Robots (HCRs) six years ago, my life and job started to become literal hell as more and more people learnt to control robots. As a senior person, i'm not fond with technology. ""You see sir, the robots working here are all Model H robots, which uses Type 16 Oil, and not Type 18 Oil, which was only used by the model X robots."". Amazed at the newfound evidence. I commended the young officer. Indeed, this was the big break that we needed. I surveyed the surveillance footage once more, and indeed, a model X robot had gone through this corridor.
I turnt to the police officers who were busily discussing their own theories. ""Boys, we've found the bot, now lets find the man"". Feeling confident and at the same time partially worried, i headed off back to the station. Only god will know where this case might take us. After all, this was a professional job.
(Thank you for reading! Please leave some feedback for me to reflect and improve on! This is my 2nd writing prompt ever!)",0
"The world was divided into three sorts of people. The castle folks who lived a comfortable life in the sky. The Valiant, who either had flying contraptions or tamed dragons, and lived in the valley or the castle. And the people beyond the valley. The valley was protected by the Valiant. The dragons were usually enough to keep the outsiders out, but there were some outsiders who were braver, or curious about what was beyond the mountains, or why there were always clouds coming out of the valley. Policy about what to do with the intruders varied from generation to generation, ranging from ""kill on sight,"" ""test their worthiness,"" to ""offer them trade deals,"" depending on the how life in the valley was.
Currently, the policy dictated that the intruders be administered a test or other challenge, of which there was an approved list of options for the intruders to choose from. If they passed, they would be presented the option of either permanently relocating into the world inside the valley (they would be permitted to bring their families), or entering a trade partnership with the people of the valley, but never being able to see the valley themselves. If they failed, they would be administered a memory-befuddling drug and sleeping drought, and then safely returned to the outside world. Repeat offenders would be blindfolded and brought to trial in the castle.
Despite being the safest city in the world, the princess was still heavily guarded within the castle, and was rarely allowed to wander the streets of the castle town. Occasionally she would be able to arrange a Valiant escort down to the valley floor to swim in the crystal clear river. Still, she longed for freedom. She had been known on multiple occasions to have attempted to trade places with her servants, sneaking out to the castle town, but was always found quickly. Her new plan was even bolder and more daring though.
One day, on one of her trips to the valley floor, she drugged all but one of her Valiant escorts into a deep sleep that would last for more than a few hours, ensuring she would have sufficient time to convince the last guard, a trainee only slightly older than her, to show her the rest of the world.
""I wish to see the world outside the valley,"" she said, point blank, to the last remaining guard.
He looked around at his sleeping comrades. ""What have you done?""
""I thought you might be the easiest to talk into showing me,"" she said, in a bit of a singsong voice. ""You have a dragon. You're only a little older than I am.""
""Do you know why you always ride the contraptions?"" he asked her.
""Seats are easier to add to the contraptions than to a dragon's saddle,"" she replied.
""True, but there is another reason. It's one your father tried to keep hidden from you, because your mother died when you were young, leaving you as sole heir to the throne.""
""I know he wants to keep me safe and unscratched, so I can be queen when he croaks."" She was getting impatient, and curious. ""He has a long line of suitors from around the castle lined up to court me. Tell me something I don't know.""
""Your mother was Valiant. A dragon-riding Valiant. You mustn't tell anyone I told you this. Your father would have me killed. But if you ride a dragon, you will establish a link with it. Such links are not easily broken. It's part of your blood, a legacy your mother left you, and which will be passed down for a few generations further. The trait is renewed, ensured to pass to the next generation, by bonding with a dragon.""
The news was a shock. It took her a moment to process it. ""I still want to see the land outside the valley.""
""Having two Valiant bonded with a dragon isn't wise,"" the guard said. ""Not only does it create a mental link between the dragon and riders, but between the two riders.""
""Then find me a dragon,"" she demanded. ""I've seen you flying in groups and formations.""
""You don't just find a dragon."" The guard was starting to both be angry with the princess and admire her determination and fire. ""Until bonded, they are incredibly secretive, and will return to that secrecy to nest.""
Nobody had spent more time watching the valley floor than the princess, who, while trapped in the castle, did have some license to explore the secured confines of the innermost circle of the city, the royal circle, and had spent a fair amount of time in the upper parapets, staring out the windows. During that time, she had seen her fair share of dragons, both with Valiant riders and without. And the ones without always vanished into the distant northern cliffs, where the valley was bounded by even taller mountains, that nobody could scale. ""Unlike you, I have spent many a day watching the motions of the dragons, and may know where they nest. Now, will we be walking or riding?"" She began to lace her boots back on.
Nobody in the castle denied that the princess was beautiful. Besides the fact that denying her beauty was nearly as terrible as treason, she was indeed fair in appearance, with long, wavy brunette hair, sparkling green eyes, and fair, clear skin. Only the richest, most prominent families in the town had any hopes of wedding their sons to the princess, but as she still a few months before coming of age, her father had not been able to present the suitors to her yet. Here in the valley marked the first time she had been alone with a man other than her father.
Something came over the guard, which most people would call attraction to the princess, and he weighed how much the rules really mattered up against the wishes of a princess. Combined with curiosity, what remained of his zeal for the rules crumbled. He smiled at her.
With wild giggles, the two young people climbed onto the back of the Valiant guard's fire-colored dragon.
""Not many women number among the Valiant,"" the princess commented as they tried to figure out the best way to fit both of them onto the saddle.
""Most leave the service once they are betrothed,"" the guard explained. ""Or will assume less dangerous jobs until they have children to care for.""
The princess felt strange tingles all around, from her head to her toes, as the dragon stirred to life, preparing to take flight.
As they took flight, she began to sense her guard urging the dragon north, and the dragon's resistance to going there.
""I am Princess Madelina of the Castle in the Sky, daughter of the King of the Hidden Valley and Queen Adelina, a Valiant dragon rider,"" she thought. ""I wish to claim my birthright as a daughter of a Valiant dragon rider, to find for myself a dragon, and embrace the bravery of the Valiant Order and see what lies beyond the Hidden Valley.""
The dragon continued to resist going north, but it was losing the mental battle with two rides urging it north.
""You need to be careful,"" the Valiant guard said. ""If you try to direct a dragon too much, you can become lost in its mind.""
""You cannot ride another dragon and properly bond with it,"" the dragon spoke to both of them, in their minds. ""Not unless you both break this bond with me, or I find a mate and we have hatchlings. Then you could also ride my mate.""
""Return us to the highest parapet of the castle, and do not return until such a time,"" Madelina thought.
""Are you mad?"" the Valiant guard said aloud. He knew she was. He kinda liked that.
The dragon did as Madelina instructed. She led her Valiant guard down to her father's chambers.
""Where is the rest of your guard?"" he asked.
""Safely asleep on the valley floor,"" she said. ""I know you have prepared a list of suitors for me, for when I come of age in a season. I will deny all of them."" For in the time that both she and her guard had been bonded with the dragon, the found a mutual sense of adventure, and a knowledge that the course both of them had been put on by their families would never allow that.
---
Some years later, well after Madelina and Arturo were married, to the shock and joy of the castle, but before they had children, the fire-colored dragon returned, with an emerald blue one by its side, and with an oddly shaped gem in one of the blue dragon's talons, their hatchling, too young to fly any great distances or any great height.
A great army was arriving from beyond the valley, moving under the dead of night and vanishing from sight during the day. One dragon riding Valiant escaped the initial battle. Madelina and Arturo had only just had time to mount the dragons when the news arrived.
""Fetch me a sword,"" Madelina ordered. Her father was old and ailing now, and most of the castle's management fell to her and Arturo.
Minutes later, outfitted for battle, she, Arturo, and the dragons took off for battle, followed by all the Valiant in the city, save the few messengers sent in other directions to summon the other Valiant from their stations. There was a fierce look on Madelina's face as the wind rippled through her hair, for though she had never fought, the thrill was in her blood, as was riding dragons.",0
"(This actually happened to me)
*what a fucking day*
I eased open the door to the building, wondering how this bleak weather would greet me.
*wind in my face. not surprising*
Clacking my boots on the pavement, I headed towards my car. The last one in the parking lot.
*shit, my tire is losing air again. i wonder where the closest free air pump is*
I started my car and before I put it in reverse, my mind wandered to where I should stop on the way home. Not only for air in my tires, but for groceries too. Nothing sounded appetizing. I shot a quick text to my boyfriend asking what sounded good for dinner. As the text was sending I pulled out of the parking spot and swerved out of the lot.
*at the rate my errands are piling up, i'll never get home. maybe i'll just eat that ice cream that's in the freezer for dinner. *
I decided to get groceries anyway. Being winter, the sun set at 5pm when I got off work, it was barely dusk when I got to the store. I grabbed some beef, chives, onions, tortillas and cheese. Enchiladas.
*yum*
I merged into the bypass that would take me home. My commute was typically only a 20 minute drive on a country backroad I usually take. No stoplights or stop signs. But going to the store took me off that route and into town. Traffic was a nightmare.
*i'll just stay in my lane and take it slow and easy, no need to rush*
It was dark now. I decided to skip the air in my tire. I'd get it tomorrow. Today was shitty anyway, I just wanted to get home. A customer called and asked where their order was, I had forgotten to place it the day before and got in deep shit with their sales rep. Basically a day from hell.
*alright, passing sunshine street and i'll be home in 25 if there's no traffic jams. *
The long road I was on was dimly lit by street lamps. It curved back and forth over and over. No discernible landmarks or streets. A straight shot til my next turn. The bypass is on the west part of town, so it's next to a bunch of farmland. It was an easy drive. Not difficult to let your mind wander. I turned on the radio and let the road take me home.
*good god i am hungry. *
I texted my boyfriend to let him know to preheat the oven and I was on my way.
*nice, sunshine street. i should be home in no time*
Wait.
I already passed sunshine. I was way passed sunshine. If I hadn't clearly seen the sign on the stoplight as I passed it that said Sunshine street, I wouldn't be concerned.
*what the fuck is happening*
The road started to bend. Just like it did after passing sunshine. That familiar back and forth suddenly sent an eerie chill through my body.
*this isn't right*
It was already past dark. The faint streetlights seemed to mock me as I sat up in my carseat and leaned forward, pressing on the gas just a bit more.
*maybe i'm just confused. i hardly ever take this way home, i'm just not familiar with the route*
I looked around. In my rearview there was one car in the distance following me. ""Sunshine Street"" had disappeared. Around each bend the car got further behind me until I couldn't see him anymore.
*alone*
I felt a deep sense of dread. Of loneliness. Isolation. It was cold outside. Cold and dark. The road never seemed to stop.
I looked at the clock. 5:57pm. Time had gone too quickly, I should have been home by now. I hadn't gotten a text from my boyfriend yet.
*what is going on? *
The stress of the day crescendo'd into a panic, and then diminished as I saw a stoplight far ahead.
*finally*
Whatever anxiety I had about the situation broke, and I could feel my heart thumping in my ears as I pulled up to my turn. There were other cars at the stoplight. I waited...It felt like a loose string needed to be tied in my brain.
*what the hell was that? *
I turned left.",0
"I thought it would be colder, overall.
When my body was being prepped and I signed the mandatory liability claims, which I felt were more of a bureaucratic formality, oh how I wish I took that 10-day legal studies master course in Khan VR. My very nerves were glazed instantly with a thick preserving frost with its usual instant numbness, but something was off, I remembered the warning now: All Neural implants must be declared before service. I felt everything shut down except my tinnitus, a usually tolerable aftereffect of my subpar self-surgery.
""Fuck"" echoed through my very empty mind.
When I decided to be an investigative journalist, examining the wrong doings of conglomerates that control entire asteroid mining expeditions and star-skimming operations, I felt that I was smart enough to know how to make a difference without being a martyr. Having illegally and home brew connected neural enhancers and occipital lobe 'plants tied to my eyes was one of my ways to get a highclass admin position at Orion-Noko Production Enterprises without getting flagged as a corporate espionage agent, or worse a freelance reporter with a high sense of ethics.
What I was lacking, was the actual experience with cryo-interaction with deep cognition implants. Luckily, 8 years in my own head without any sense except for thought has at least gave me time to manually reconstruct several lessons of nano-computing physics and bio-connections. What it hasn't done, was keep me from making over 6 million different plans to crucify the O.N Enterprises CEO's scrotum on live feed. The one where I learn to terraform an asteroid into a large space golem that punches through that fucker's personal earth orbiting satellite island is my favourite. Though, what it helped me do is learn about the human machine, I knew my philosophy courses would play out one day.
I could keep track of time through an internal clock, my neural works allow me to multitask cognitively, which most people without an implant will find a cognitive impossibility to actually think of two things at once, which is a life saver since I can keep time running. I knew the approximate time of our cryo-trip was 8-years, 3-years manual observation of the mineral harvest and some self-experimentation for those interested in the extra-credit. I'm a person known for thinking things through, as I am doing so in the 49.5 miliseconds as I can literally feel my body being unfrozen, the blackness only filled with my own mental illusions lifted and my first words being uttered,
""That was a nice 5 minutes of sleeping upwards. Got any cheese?""
I'm going to break this conglomerate apart and show the world and suffer another 8 years in my circus of a subconscious if I need to do it.",0
"**October 7, 2046**
They rode in silence.
The crew compartment was stuffy, cramped. Slim tendrils of blue smoke snaked from the captain's cigar, dancing in the red running light. John sat with his back to the hull, listening to the dull roar of the hoverjets, the mechanical chorus of readied weapons, the whispered prayers.
This was the third year of the operation, the largest ground war in living memory. Before they shipped out the CO had praised their bravery, their courage, their strength. They were rebuilding America, one city block at a time. They would be remembered as heroes.
* ""Thirty seconds!"" *
The call came through his headset. Within the claustrophobic confines of his helmet John watched his heads-up display flare to life; suit vitals, overhead map, bullet-pointed objectives.
He looked around at the up-armored soldiers around him, watched as they went through their pre-battle rituals. He tried to guess who they were beneath the dull, emotionless visors.
The captain rose, cradling her helmet under one arm, the other bracing against the hull. ""Alright, listen up,"" she shouted over the bubbling commotion, ""our target is an insurrectionist strong hold out past Old Seattle. Reports indicate a large stockpile of weapons and ammunition has been moved underground, into the subway tunnels. They've been peppering our boys for weeks, and we're gonna stop em. So check your weapons, keep your heads down, and don't get killed.""
John could see the exhaustion in her eyes, the haunted thousand-yard stare so common among the veterans. The captain surveyed the soldiers, nodded, and slipped on her helmet. With a wave of her hand the thirty men and women rose.
The light shifted green, the transport landed with a spine-jarring impact, and the rear hatch hissed open. Into chaos.
***
His head pounded, he could taste blood. John came to with a start, fighting for breath. His vision was dark. For a heartbeat he feared he was blind, until a small, red warning icon flashed before his eyes.
John reached up, undid the clasps around his neck, and tossed his dented helmet aside. He was on his back, staring up at a smoke-clouded sky. He could hear the staccato retorts of small arms fire echoing across the city, the tortured screams. He tried to rise, but collapsed when his knee buckled. He looked down and nearly vomited at the site of his leg.
A nearby explosion shook him to his senses, and he took in the scene around him. The transport listed over him, nearly toppled. It had touched down along a residential street lined with burned-out houses and smoking craters, before meeting its end; the front half had been ripped open and was dripping molten slag on the cracked pavement. There were bodies.
He felt for his rifle, but it was gone. He reached for his sidearm, but it too was missing. He pulled the reserve radio from his belt and scanned through the channels, but all that returned was static. A thought surfaced through the daze; get off the street.
Bracing himself, John rose on his elbows and crawled away from the smoldering wreck, wincing as his mangled leg jostled along the uneven ground. He didn't know where to go, just that he should be away. His head was spinning, and he had to stop several times to catch his breath and fight back the encroaching darkness.
Feeling his strength returning, John reached out for a fallen tree branch and hoisted himself to his feet, using the limb as a crutch. Before him was a house, relatively untouched by the flames and the battle, and through his addled mind he figured it to be a safe place to hide, to wait for reinforcements. There would be reinforcements, right?
John looked around, but the street remained empty, save for the occasional crow swooping in for a feast. The shelter of the house called to him, reached out. He doubled his pace.
As he hobbled up the driveway, past the scorched hulk of a minivan, he did a double-take. There, in the window, was a face, for just a moment. Ignoring his mounting fears, he called out, a desperate wordless plea.
He stumbled, landing on the ruined remains of his leg. The world swam, he tasted copper, and the darkness swept over him like a warm wave.
***
John awoke to a sharp pain in his leg. He tried to call out, but his throat was parched, and all he could manage was a wheeze.
He looked around through crusted eyes; he was in a room, thin streams of light filtering through pin-prick bullet holes. As his eyes adjusted to the dark, he began make out figures, sheltered in the gloom.
As the past events surfaced in his memory, John instinctively pushed himself upright and nearly swooned as the pain returned in full. He managed to reach the far wall and sit up, his back supported by the rotting woodwork.
A break in the cloud cover cast a ray of light into the house; it was a living room, tattered and singed. Furniture had been shoved against the windows, boards had been hammered across the door, and there were people.
For the first time in the war, John got his first true look at the enemy. They were men and women, some old, some young, all hunched, grey-faced, exhausted, and all carried weapons. They stared at him with dull, lifeless eyes.
For what seemed to John like an eternity, nobody moved. The gunfire beyond the thin walls slowed, then stopped. The group before him shuffled, seeming unsure of what to do.
Finally, John stomached his fear. ""Water…"" he croaked, reaching out the group.
There was a hushed conversation among the gaunt crowd. Then a man walked forward, who must have been their leader. He was young, yet the pain in his eyes denied his age. He carried a pistol.
The man walked across the room to stand before John. For a heartbeat the two locked eyes, and John realized that they were likely the same age. They might have even gone to the same schools, before the insurrection.
The pistol wavered, then rose, the cold barrel pressed against John's forehead.
""This is for Lisa…""
Beyond fear, John nodded, closed his eyes, and waited. But the shot didn't come. The barrel fell, and John heard the young man step back amid a torrent of angry whispers.
When he opened his eyes there was a face there, a young girl of no more than six. She reached for his hand and wrapped his fingers around a cracked china cup. ""Drink…""",0
"The Pop Idols, as they have been taken to calling themselves, count on their catchy tunes and simple melodies to command the weak willed. As such, they have command over most of the land. Only the Bluesmen of the South and the Grunge Lords of the Pacific manage a hold over their lands. As they try to keep life as normal as possible with their grounded tones, few rouge Idols wander into their territories, seeking to rule over all of what was North America.
I try to live my life in seclusion nowadays. After the events of my last skirmish some four years ago, when my power began to manifest, I decided that I had to learn control to avoid the near destruction of my town. Plus, being hunted by the Idols tends to keep a lively jolt in ones step. Just outside of the Grudge Capital Seattle, in a town now know as Veddersberg, I make a living repairing the strings and kits of other musicians. There tales of battle and small victories over Pop Idols worry me. More and more repairs are having to be made. I decided it was only a matter of time before they come.
I did not know it would be tonight.
Under the cover of darkness, the Pop Idols amassed a force of Stadium Rockers and Rap Rockers to overload the town with earthquakes and confusion spells. The Grudge Lords begin to amass an offensive of their own, with mumbled lyrics and crafty rifts scattering some of the Idols forces. I wait in my home, for I know what is to come next.
Suddenly, a large clap is heard. A blonde haired girl drops down with a piano, General Swift as I thought, and she mixes her country and pop together to force down her foes with several bars of You Belong with Me, healing her soldiers with Shake it off. Before too long, the Grunge Lords kneel helplessly as she finishes them off with keystroke of her massive piano. My love has perished among the ranks. The forces approach my door, Swift smiling at the destruction she has brought.
It is time.
My throat begins to vibrate, my stomach tightens, and my growl deepens. The Pop Idols stand stunned as the earth around them begins to break and open, sending dozens falling into the shallow ground. Before they can pull themselves out, my army of Berserkers grab hold of their victims, slashing violently at their prey. As Swift attempts to amass her forces, my Valkyrie band descends from the sky, assembling my home into my longboat. Hundreds of bearded men and ten frost giants now await my command. General Swift stands horrified at what she has just discovered.
She has forced open the gates of Valhalla. One greedy Idol has forced my hand. Now is the time of Ragnarok.",0
"You wouldn't think that a jolly fat man who brings presents to little boys and girls would have so many enemies but he does. There are a ton of politics that go into being Santa, and for the past 10 years I've been his ""repair man"". I helping fix any problems that may arise. Labor disputes between elves, reindeer suppliers wanting to back out. Originally it was easy for the big man to deliver joy to all the little boys and girls of the earth but that was back when A piece of fruit and a wooden car would put a smile on their face. Then along came things like Hasbro, Lego, Barbie then those were all that kids wanted. These things aint cheap. So Santa had to start doing the one thing he could think of to make ends meet, drug trafficking. I mean no one could beat ""around the world in one night"".
I guess he got lucky with me. You see I was never the smartest guy. I dropped out of high school and spent the next six years trying to make ends meet however I could. One night I got desperate. I was going to sell my soul to the devil in order to get what I wanted. I had everything set up, candles, pigs blood, the whole nine yards. Except one small thing, I wrote Santa instead of Satan, I mean looked right to me but must have been my dyslexia. And so here I am, the assassin for a jolly fat man.",0
"When I was a young boy, my father and I went into the city on a cold winter day. He told me never to go to the city alone, but that it was important I see what happened there.
As we entered through a large, ornate blackend iron gate, I began to ask how that could happen to metal but hushed me and told me not to speak until he spoke to me. I nodded meakly and we continued into the city.
There were scores of people lining the streets, but no one made a sound. The silence in a city so large was eerie at best. Even as a child I knew something was wrong. Once again I began to ask my father our purpose but he shushed me once more. Then I heard it.
From what seemed like a great distance, music began to play. But not any kind of music I had heard before. It grew in volume exponentially fast, covering what seemed like miles in mere moments. Then they turned onto the street we were standing to the side of.
What I saw would later be explained to me as the black parade. It was led by a marching band, but something was wrong with their instruments. Every chord and note seemd sour somehow. Behind them were scores of soldiers, all armed to the teeth and dressed in black combat gear. Once they had passed my father and I swiftly left the city.
Once we got home, he told me about the black parade and why it existed. There were things in this world which needed to be contained and controlled. He said that because I was his first born son, that one day when I was older I would need to become a savior, someone who could bring salvation to those who were broken and dammed. That I would join the Black Parade. Today is day 421 of my march, and the music plays on.",0
"I've been driving all night, and most of the day before it. It doesn't help that it gets dark at like, four in this god-forsaken state. To make matters worse, just like every other state with more cows than people, it's absolutely frigid. If I see one more empty cornfield, I might just scream.
I glance down at the radio. Two AM, exactly three minutes from the last time I checked it. On the bright side, that means only about six more hours of driving. On the other hand, I've been on the road for about ten hours more than that.
There are a small collection of lights up ahead; I utter a silent thanks to whatever may be listening, as I have three Red Bulls and a Gatorade's worth of a piss to take. The town is tiny, and the 'Welcome' sign says it on both sides. I always thought places that small were a joke.
Really, it's a wonder this collection of farmers that happen to live next to each other has the traffic for a 24 hour gas station, but here it is. I pull up in front of it, and briefly consider turning off my engine. 'Fuck that,' I think to myself. I'm not getting back into a freezing car, and the twelve people that live in this town are either asleep or working in a gas station. I step out, careful not to hit the 'lock' button as I exit. This is not a place one should be stuck out of their car.
The high-school aged kid working the till doesn't even look up from his phone as he mutters something unintelligible that I assume is a greeting. I grunt back in kind, and go into the bathroom to take the most glorious leak of my life. On my way out, I buy one of those 1.5 liter 'travel sized' waters, just because I hate stopping at a place just to use the facilities.
The exchange is over, and I brave 15 yards of frigid weather to get back into my warm car that I'll spend the next quarter-day in and pull out of the lot. 2:16 AM. Could time pass any slower?
I sort of zone out for a while. Straight roads, dead of winter, not a single other car since about 10 PM, what reason is there to pay attention? I snap back to reality when I hear it.
The song. Everyone says something douchy about it. ""You'll know when you hear it."" ""I could never even begin to explain it"". Without exception, I responded with a smart ass remark, never believing a word. But it's loud. So loud, I worriedly begin to look for a train, or a semi honking at me, about to end my life before I realize how beautiful it is. I'm nearly brought to tears listening to it, like some cheesy choir of angels was descending, telling me what was about to happen.
The voice is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Like honey pouring into my ears. I'm so entranced by it, I wouldn't have even noticed the gun if not for the cold metal against the back of my head.
""Hey, sweetie,"" the apparent love of my life says softly. ""I'm still gonna need you to pull the car over.""",0
"""But why was I given an 'F'? I covered every requirement on the report, and even did the extra-credit portion at the end,"" I exclaimed.
""My dear boy, your paper was well written, but it misses the point of the assignment entirely."" Mr. Alder sighed as he steepled his fingers and leaned back behind his desk. ""This exercise was supposed to be a literary review of the themes and devices used by the author, but you paper reads like a war report by a field marshal.""
""But-""
""Now, don't get me wrong, Bernie. It was a creative piece. However, this does not excuse the blatant disregard for the assignment. Hence, the 'F'.""
""But I told you exactly what the author was thinking throughout the entire novel!""
""How? How could you possibly have known that the author *ahem* 'was expressing his fear through the main character' when he wrote about 'the Creeping Tendrils of Venus', unless you were the author himself. He was clearly commentating on the corrupting effects of the female personality in our society, by the way.""
""I...Bu-...What?"" I spluttered.
I slumped back into my chair, defeated. It was useless. I could defeat the armies of Mars and save Pluto from near destruction, but I couldn't correct one high-school English teacher unless I gave away my secret identity.
Oh, well. I'd just have to prove him wrong in the next volume of Nebu-lad.",0
"My team and I had found where the humans were hiding. We all decided they posed a threat to the advancement of our race. It was either us or them. We could bring our race to the edge of the known universe, colonize, thrive, live in a way God couldn't have even imagined. But as long as the humans lived, they continued to hate us, they continued to attack us.
We were hovering over where a group could be hiding. I looked out the window of our craft, and I saw the target. We had been searching through China for months homing in on their location. And now we reached them here.
We landed. Our craft's ramp fell to the ground, and we walked down. The temple was dark. It was night, and there haven't been any artificial lights in China for centuries. We didn't need them. Our sight was enhanced for the darkness, unlike the imperfect humans'.
""Toad,"" I called his name. We called him so for his abilities. He could scale walls and jump ten times higher than a human. His best attribute, however, would be his incredible tongue. He could extend it upwards of fifteen feet and then latch onto anything it could get a hold of. ""See what you can find,"" I told him as I pointed to the top of the temple. He sprinted towards the temple, jumped, and latched on to the side of the stone wall. As he clambered to the top, the rest of us decided to bust in through the front door.
The entrance seemed to be sealed off with a boulder, barely an inconvenience. One of our team just ran straight into it, knocking the rock away. I gave him a pat on the shoulder, and we walked in. We found a hallway, and at the end we saw a room glowing with light. I lead the way into the room. I turned the corner, and on the ground was a lamp surrounded by ten or so horribly thin humans. They looked as if they hadn't eaten for days, and they were covered in grime and dirt. They looked up at us but didn't try to run. They realized their defeat.
I could sense one of the humans had a knife on them. I felt the knife with my mind and yanked it from his backpack and into the air. I had the ability to control metal objects with my mind, and use them without even moving a muscle. The knife hovered above his head. One of the women screamed as I plunged it into his face. The rest died quickly by the hands of my team.
My team calls me Magneto. And the humans are near extinction.",0
"The storm came on slowly, looming ominously throughout the day until the fading light vanished beyond the horizon, and with it, peace. The winds howled furiously, the trees' branches shaking violently, the weaker ones snapping off. Then the black clouds unleashed the might of their rain The torrent drowned out all other sound. Only the terrible crack of thunder rose above the din, thrumming with deadly ominousness. Dust turns to mud, roads into rivers. Animals are driven inside with frantic energy as their minders urge them onward. Elsewhere, others race about in urgency as well.
Up on the cliffs overlooking the port, the castle is awake in the storm. Staff enlist the aid of the palace guards, sending them to and fro bearing buckets as they struggle to prevent the leaks from damaging the castle. Throughout the castle can be heard the *Drip, drip, drip* of tin buckets and wooden pail as they rapidly fill up. The housekeeper directs battle-hardened soldiers as they race to keep the storm from ruining any of the priceless items within the palace.
Perched up on the banister overlooking the great hall is Sir Lawrence, garbed in his cloak of office and badge of rank. Leaning against a tall marble column, he lets one of his booted feet dangle freely in the air, tapping absently to the sound of the nearest filling bucket. His eyeless sockets stare out emptily over the teem mass of servants and guards, taking in the scene like twin black holes. A skeletal hand is hitched on his sword belt, the leather well worn and oiled. The other scratches at a beard that hasn't existed for a hundred years.
Thunder roars. Then lightning strikes the castle, blinding the castle's staff and Lawrence's soldiers in a feverish light. Several cry aloud at painful brightness before it abruptly vanishes into lingering nothingness.
Slowly, the work is resumed, men and women reorganizing the brigade of buckets and moving irreplaceable carpets and furniture to drying quarters. Sir Lawrence however has his attention directed elsewhere.
His rotting head raised in alarm, he swings his hanging leg back over the railing and breaks out into a jog, chain mail rippling with his movements.With his left hand, he loosens the sword from its scabbard, readying it in case.
*That was unnatural. Thunder before lightning? Impossible. Save for one reason...*
His heavy boots thud against the cold stone of the floor as he races past the portraits of previous rulers, their usual stern gaze darkening. Eyes drip like melted tallow, leaking darkness onto the grey stone. Mouths widen sickeningly, growing wider and wider until their smiles stretch from ear to ear. Needle like teeth are planted in gums black with rot grin at Lawrence as he begins to sprint. Dark parodies of his own affliction laugh at him, hissing in delight as a cold knot forms in his mummified throat. Rain drips onto Lawrence's shoulder. Stealing a glance upwards, he witnesses the fresco overhead writhe in horrific fashion. Hundreds of beasts tear into one another. Hydras duel with griffins while phoenixes claw dragons before being roasted in bale-fire. Manticores are turned to stone upon gazing into the eyes of the Cockatrice.
Lawrence pays them no heed, instead barreling down the hallway and slamming the door at the end clean open. The inch thick oak cracks as he enters the room.
Queen Malvina is sitting down amongst physical darkness blacker than death itself. Kicking it up like fog as he makes his way towards her, the corners of his eyes glance around the room, at the corpses within the paintings that hang on the walls. His boots squelch from some unknown source hidden in the inky fog. Cradled within Malvina's arms is the limp body of Dieter, portions of him visibly rotting, his bright shining teeth revealed through the gaping wound in his cheek. One arm is but bone with shreds of ligaments hanging on. His open eyes are pale and dim.
""He's dead..."" She says softly, tears dripping down her cheeks.
Sir Lawerence kneels down, gently taking the form of Dieter from her hands. ""No. He's not.""",0
"I am alone. The silence is empowering. Nothing to hear. Nobody to talk to. I can finally be alone with my thoughts. Eternity is mine, and mine alone, and in it, I am whole. I am free. Someone tried to take my eternity from me. A man. He liked to talk. He didn't want to be alone. He would talk for hours, stealing my time from me. He said such strange things. He wanted to bring back humanity. He tried to force me to help him. I hit him in the head with a rock. The man finally stopped talking. And now I am alone again.",0
"The telescope was patterned with verdigris and fingerprints, but the brass was still bright.
It had belonged to Robin's grandfather and her grandmother had set it up for her on the rural porch, preparing for the orbiting object. The young girl had done the mathematics herself, figuring out where in the sky the satellite would fly by and helping her grandmother's spidery, blue-veined hands to get the old instrument at the correct azimuth.
""I polished the lens,"" the old woman said as she gazed up into the clear night sky, ""you can see Sirius clear as day.""
Robin nodded and flipped though her notes, her auburn eyebrows drawn together in worry.
""I hope I got this right.""
Her grandfather's pocket watch sat nearby, ticking resolutely. They had another ten minutes before it was due to breach the horizon.
The old woman draped a shawl around her granddaughter's shoulders; it was cold and the girl hadn't dressed warmly - she was flushed with excitement and the heady thrill of adventure.
*Is this a mistake? *
The thought came unbidden to the grandmother's mind. Was she a fool to encourage activities like this? Her own mother - were she still alive - would be sniping at her about encouraging girls to be dreamers, not homemakers.
But the old woman remembered her own dreams at Robin's age - selfish dreams of inventing electric devices, of making circuits of copper and batteries, exploring the seemingly unlimited potential of the new age of electricity.
""Grandma,"" the girl began, ""do you think they'll ever put a man in space?""
The matriarch gave a frail smile,
""I don't doubt it child; it is only a matter of time and money I'd say.""
Robin pursed her lips, wondering if she should ask the next question.
Detecting the reluctance of her granddaughter, she wrapped her thin arms around the child's shawl-draped shoulders in reassurance.
""Grandma,"" Robin licked her lips,
""Yes little one?""
""Do you...do you think they'll ever put a *woman* in space?""
Even though she'd known the question was coming, the old woman known as Jolene sucked in a sudden breath, a curious *pang* touching her heart.
""I don't know,"" she admitted with bald-faced honesty - the kind she didn't normally use around children.
They sat in silence for the remaining four minutes, watching the hands of the pocket watch tick around the mother-of-pearl face.
As the moment arrived, the girl pressed her eye to the telescope and watched intently.
For a few precious seconds, she saw a dim, moving light rise through the lens - then it was gone from her view.
With a whoop of joy she leaped up from the wicker chair and hugged her grandmother around the middle,
""I *saw it* Grandma! I saw *Sputnik! *""
Holding her granddaughter close, the old woman smiled. The girl had calculated everything correctly; her mathematical precision was uncanny for a nine-year-old.
""Come inside Robin,"" she said, ""your hands are frozen.""
Leaving her dead husband's telescope on the porch, she took the child's hand and led her back inside.",0
"""Look fuhrer, look here! these people have made a writing prompt where killing you is a sport and the entire point is to be the most creative person who killed you!"" I claim while pointing at the screen of my laptop, which I brought with me into the past. it's amazing how you can connect to the internet of the future in the past just by bringing something from the future into the past, it's a strange occurrence called ""temporal information bridging"" and is based on the idea that the universe is composed of information, so bringing something from one point in time doesn't necessarily disconnect it from that point in time, in other words because there's an internet signal in this specific location at some point in the future, bringing a laptop connected to that specific internet connection at that point in time into the past doesn't terminate the connection.
makes my head hurt just to think about it.
""so...even now my enemies in the future who have demonized me continue trying to hunt me and doom me."" the fuhrer clutched his head, and i could sense the existential anguish.
""to think all this time I would be immortalized as their private devil! to think I could have done so poorly in my life that i am like the demons of hell! you time traveler, you have confided in me when I needed you the most, when you first came to the past you protected me from these other time travelers, brought order back to the reich and killed these fools contending to slay me. now that too has become a running joke in some alternate timeline! what a tragedy this life of mine is! that I could become so trivial and hated that I cannot even defend my image from the ravages of time!""
he slammed his fist down on the laptop, breaking it before realizing his error and fuhreiously apologizing.
""what must I do to atone for this? how can I bring myself from the hell I have coming to me?!""
""furher."" I began. ""you're not to blame, you suffer from a disease, syphilis.""
""yes, I recall you mentioning that...but does that absolve me?"" he asked angrily.
""No, it doesn't absolve you I suppose, but you aren't entirely responsible for your actions either."" i explained. ""you fight two enemies now, the time travelers and their future, and your own mind, ailing, breaking. you can repent for the crime of the holocaust, the people will still hate you of course, they'll never pay attention to your redemption because the story of the wicked adolf hitler holds their hearts in far greater sway. but you can prevent yourself from doing the world any further harm.""
I hand him a gun.
""the japanese believe that death by suicide carries its own form of honor, that to act out of duty to that which you believe by taking your own life is a firmer statement than simply dying fighting for it. you regret the holocaust, you accept your illness and we both know there is no cure for your mind's degraded state. you will only get worse from here, if you truly wish to redeem yourself.....well...show the world by sacrificing your life for that redemption.""
""will anything change?"" hitler asked suspiciously.
""no, but good people, german and jewish, will be spared the madness of adolf hitler the villain, because adolf hitler the repentant man stood against his own mind, his worst nemesis, and defeated it for them.""
adolf turned the weapon over slowly before nodding to himself.
""very well then.....but do me a favor, yes?""
""what is it?""
""remember me for this...remember that I redeemed myself and renounced my foolish, wicked actions....if the future hates me so be it, but please....remember this final moment.""
he put the gun to his temple, I stared impassively as the flash from the muzzle rang out, shattering his skull.
with a sigh I returned to the future where the judges awaited me.
""amazing, simply amazing! such a masterful manipulation of a man's emotions!! you're truly frightening!!""
they awarded me maximum points, and from there I decided to post this in the /r/ writing prompts of reddit on a return trip to my vacation home in the year 2016, which happens to be the old fuhrer's home.
all in all it wasn't that hard, driving a crazy man to suicide? pff, easy.
getting hitler to redeem himself by humbling him with visions of the future?
that shit was the hard part.",0
"""Hit him.""
""What?""
""I said hit him.""
Jacob's mouth set into a thin line, but he did as he was told, and delivered a strong blow to the angel's delicate face. Blood oozed from the side of his head, painting his golden hair a rosy pink, and in the dim light, it looked as though it were tinted with bits of sunlight.
""All you gotta do is answer our questions, Halo, and we'll let you go."" Marin said, propping herself up on the angel's chair. She was becoming frustrated with the being that sat before them. For three days they have shot him full of questions, kept him in solitary confinement, and they still didn't even know his name.
The angel grinned and spat some of his blood onto the ground. ""You're as likely to let me go as I am to answer your questions. I'm not stupid, Marinda. I've already come to terms with my fate.""
""Then why don't you just answer our questions? It won't help you in any way to stay loyal to your brethren."" Jacob spoke up. He was twiddling a knife between his fingers, an action that didn't go unnoticed by the angel. Marin almost laughed. She knew it was his nervous habit to always play with whatever he was holding, and at this moment, it just so happened to work in their favor.
The angel chuckled. ""They are my family. I won't dishonor them. Not even with torture or death being threatened.""
Jacob sighed and drove the knife into the table, watching as the freshly sharpened blade splintered and shattered the wood beneath it. Then, he motioned towards the door, silently telling Marin that he needed some air.
When the barn door swung shut behind him, Marin spun back on the angel. Three days ago, he had been caught harvesting a soul from their neighbor, and they jumped on the opportunity of taking him prisoner. The neighbor didn't make it, unfortunately, but losses had become the norm ever since Heaven and Hell met on Earth.
""You're a fallen angel, correct?"" She whispered, yanking Jacob's knife from its place in the table.
The angel merely glared at her, though he was more surprised than angry. Her entire aura had shifted dramatically within a fraction of a second.
""Don't bother lying, I know you are. The burns on your back- two slits that perfectly match the outline of wings. You were cast out. Tell me, Halo, if your loyalty is not with your so-called brothers and sisters of Heaven, then who is it with?""
He actually looked dumbfounded by her words. He was looking her up and down, taking in slow, shaky breaths, until he finally sighed.
""You caught me."" He breathed. ""I am not aligned with Heaven.""
""But surely you wouldn't work for demons?""
He laughed sourly, the action shaking the chains that held him in place. For a second, Marin wondered if the sigils branded onto the iron would still be able to hold him.
""I'd rather die than say I work for those black-eyed abominations. No, I work for a much...greater cause."" He spat more blood onto the ground. His eyes met Marin's, their deep ocean blue struggling to connect with her in any way possible, but it wouldn't work. He was far too weak to use any kind of mind games.
Marin glanced over her shoulder to make sure Jacob was still outside, and then turned back to the angel. ""Why are you telling me all of this now? You weren't talkative five minutes ago.""
""Why did you suddenly change your questions when Jacob left the room?""
Marin bit her tongue and turned her eyes down to the floor. This angel fell, so he must have done something upstairs to warrant getting booted, but the major question on her mind was *who* his boss was. That was the information she wanted out of him, but it would be nearly impossible to break out of him.
The angel shifted in his chair. ""I'm going to warn you now, Marin, my boss is not the kind of man you want to play with. I'm sure he has heard about what you've been doing to me, and when he shows up here to take me back- you'll wish you had listened to me sooner.""
She held the knife up to the light. Jacob had gotten it from his father when he was seven, he said it was a very special blade that could protect him from any and all danger, even divine. Now, in the thin light that surrounded them both, she could see that something was written on the edge of the blade. *Do not forget, my son, God has abandoned you. *
Marin looked from the blade to the angel, and then smiled. ""Well, I guess we'll see then, won't we?""",0
"Julia woke, wincing in the harsh light, to see the doctor inspecting his instruments. He hummed a jolly tune to himself while laying the glittering tools out in front of him. She was lying upright on an operating table, her whole body at a forty-five degree angle. Her head felt thick with wool, from whatever he'd injected her with, and his voice sounded as if coming from another room.
""Had a nice nap did we?"" he said, studying a sharp scalpel.
As her dizziness faded, the realisation of what was happening came to her with slow, horrible pulses of clarity. The light from all around her pressed in, oppressive and unyielding. In spite of it, she could just make out the room she was in; an operating theatre, white, clean, smelling the same as a combination of any ordinary hospital or dental surgery she'd ever been in. Opposite her was a large, metal door, that looked like the sort used in the hidden bank vaults she'd seen in films.
""I must say you led me on quite a merry chase,"" he said, letting out a sharp, loud breath that ruffled his blue surgical mask. ""Yes. Quite a merry. Chase.""
He whistled to himself now, waltzing over to the sink and washing his hands, ignoring her struggles to break free from the thick, white leather bonds that bound her. Julia tried to piece together the preceding scenes. She had been walking in the woods, as her father had instructed her not to. She could see his wrinkled, reproachful face that had made her want to do it even more. She'd cut her knee when she spotted the house amidst the bracken, and now felt it throb. *So strange for a house to be out here*, she'd thought, and such a strange house too, all big, boxy and white. It made her think of a cartoon, though she wasn't sure which. It had looked abandoned and she'd ignored the warning voice in her head because it spoke like her father. Always sensible. Always safe. Always dull. She'd peeked in a window and saw red paint, splattered crazily on the walls and the floor of the white living room. *Someone must've danced around with a whole can of it*. That was what she thought at first. Until she saw the body propped up against a sofa, the skin torn to ribbons. Even then her brain worked to explain around it. *A film prop, like a dummy*. But it was too real. Much too real. As she turned to run, finally heeding her father's increasingly panicked voice, the front door slammed open, and a tall, rake thin man in blood-spattered doctor's attire burst out, chasing after her at once.
""Get back here you bitch,"" he'd called in a high, petulant voice. ""Fucking useless little shit,""
She ran. And ran and ran. Dodging trees and bounding over rocks, until her chest felt set to explode. And still he came, yelling and cursing, getting closer and closer. She didn't know what tripped her, but he was on her in an instant. She'd kicked and thrashed but he was so strong, and then there was a stinging in her neck. As her world turned to black, she thought, *the Powerpuff Girls'house. *
And now, he stood over her again, his clothes pristine. His eyes were filled with nothing remotely close to sanity, and she could do nothing but scream.
""No point in that,"" he said, in the tones of a friendly school teacher. ""Even if these walls weren't soundproof, there isn't anybody about for miles. Well...apart from nosy, shitty little girls. And what're the chances of there being another one of those. Actually, quite likely, if you ask me.""
He laughed in a manner that suggested it wasn't something he did often.
""Please,"" Julia said, her throat, for some reason, dry and cracked. ""I don't...”
He was right up against her face before she could finish, holding a scalpel to her left eye. She smelled his hot, sterile breath as he yelled at her in his shrill, childish voice.
""Don't you *fucking* whine like that, you baby. Don't you ever *fucking* do that again. You hear me, you fucking stupid little whore. *Pleeeeease, oooo pleeeeeeeease*.""
""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just...” she almost said it again, ""don't hurt me, don't pl-""
She felt the blade push up against her lower eyelid. Felt the tiny marble of blood that welled up against it, and stopped speaking, holding her trembling lips closed as best she could. The doctor sighed and stepped away.
""Don't take this personally,"" he said, calm now as he wheeled his tray of tools over to her, ""But it's just a matter of bad luck, really. For you, I mean. For me this is somewhat of a privilege. This is my passion, you see. My art. And the only way to truly master your art is...” he picked up what looked like a silver corkscrew, brandishing it like a paintbrush, ""Practice.""
Julia stared with wide, panicked eyes at the other instruments, hating her mind for the assumptions it made as to their usage. The doctor leaned towards her. She got the hideous sense that he had licked his lips behind his mask. She bucked and writhed as best she could, but the straps may as well've been wrought of iron. She screamed through her hoarse throat.
""Yes."" he cooed, ""Scream. There'll be plenty more of that to come.""
And then, a mighty crash as one of the walls erupted in a shower of dust and concrete, accompanied by a roar like the blaring of a titanic hell-train. Julia coughed and spluttered, and the doctor stumbled, shielding his eyes. The ground shook with the steady rhythm of an ancient god's drums and, striding forth from the rubble, emerging from the haze with awesome, primal splendour, came the tyrannosaurus.
""Curses!"" the doctor yelled. ""My secret genetic-engineering project that I keep in my basement. Oh, why didn't I use a stronger lock?""
The great beast regarded him with one cold yellow eye as he ran to the door, hopping cartoonishly on his feet, fiddling in vain with the lock, tittering nonsense to himself. Yawning it's tremendous maw, the t-rex brought it's teeth down upon the doctor and lifted him, wailing and flailing, into the air. Julia heard his bones crunch as it shook him around, like a dog with a toy, and then he was gone. The rex stamped his great, scaly foot, and roared again sending tremors throughout the room, and causing the table Julia was strapped on to come crashing down, and the bonds holding her to come loose. Her ears were ringing, and her body ached terribly from the fall, but she was alive. She rose awkwardly to her feet, dusted herself off, and stood face to face with the king of the dinosaurs. Well, more like face to knee. It looked down at her, moving it's jaw in a thoughtful way. Julia thought she saw approval in those amber eyes. With a low growl, the tyrannosaurus lowered it's head, just enough so Julia could climb up it, and over the horny scales of his brow.
And so, with her legs dangling either side of his mighty neck, the t-rex crashed through the house and out into the forest, and together, they rode off into the sunset.",0
"The camera sat on the table, just waiting for use.
Years had gone by, and temptation grew, thinking about what it knew.
Objects, the only thing it had seen, how could that be?
Seconds and minutes gave a goodbye, I needed to know what it thought of me.
I took a step, a step closer indeed.
I peered over, grabbing it with need.
In front, was a mirror, my reflection beaming.
What would it tell me? Unsure I seemed.
Through the lens, I looked,
How ugly I appeared, nothing like the words of a book.
As invisible as I was, I understood.
The camera I had used, was abused, not as it should.",0
"There is actually a moment – singular and separate from all others – that one can point to in the timeline of a life and say, ""There. That. That is the space between living and, well, not quite so much of it.""
However, nobody actually takes the time out of their own days to make this sort of announcement about anyone else, because they tend to collect terribly disparaging looks when engaging in that sort of behavior. With a furrowed brow and pinched lips, most listeners eagerly attempt to physically engrave into their faces the signs of their mental efforts to reject all that the one pointing out that slippery ‘ moment'is endeavoring to assert. No one wants to believe that the life can leave someone's eyes before they hit the ground.
It is, however, a pinch more kosher to point out that someone may have been dead living after they have actually hit the ground and been summarily buried.
As family members and loved ones dig through the rotting remains of a life in the house, apartment, shack, nook, cranny, or wherever the recently deceased had spent the final years and months of their life, the habits and traditions of their existence emerge through pictures, clothing, colognes and perfumes, books, letters, terrariums, wrappers, receipts, loose nails, and scuffed floorboards. In death, a spotlight is shot directly onto the structural foundations of a person's lifestyle, making it near impossible to ignore when obvious and terrible patterns emerge.
""It feels wrong to even be saying this, but I just don't see… there isn't… I mean, what was he doing for the past thirty years?""
""Did she ever get out of that chair? Did she ever move?""
""That last while he seemed fine, but, thinking back on it, I can't remember anything we spoke about. We had conversations, but we never talked about anything that – and I hate to put it this way, you know – mattered. We shot the breeze, yeah, but it was… it was scripted, not improv. There was the weather, the kids, the economy, but he was nowhere in the middle of it. He used to make me laugh my lungs out at every other word when we were kids, but at some point he stopped saying surprising things, charming things, personal things. He stopped, and I'm not sure where, but it was a long time before all of this. The cancer didn't do it. It was earlier. Much earlier. I swept it all under the rug, because I didn't know what else to do. He wasn't sick then. He was fine.""
""I know it sounds callous, but I couldn't be sad at her wake. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why at first, but then I realized I had already been mourning her death for years now. She wasn't there anymore. You saw it too, right? That spark she always brought to the table had been ashes for a while. The lights were on, somebody was home, but they wouldn't get up to answer the door no matter how many times I knocked. God, it hurt to see her all the time, but not be able to reach her. Goddamn. It was done before it was done, you know?""
It is okay to talk about those that died while still alive when actual, physical death is there to muffle the implication. It becomes acceptable to ruminate on how the dead were living at one point in the past with their nails in the soil, burying dreams, loves, aspirations, friends, children, and, that somewhere along the way, they lost the ability to lift their head up and gaze forward. Somewhere along the road, the focus on living gave way to a slow, loose descent towards an end.",0
"""Son, come look at this sector with me.""
John walked over to his father's desk. The desk was a massive tablet and it could zoom in and out of various galaxies.
""Look here. This is the Milky Way Galaxy. Ok, nothing special right. Well, I'm going to show you something cool, but a little weird.""
John enjoyed when his father taught him about distant galaxies. But sometimes his dad was a little crazy.
""Ok, so here, right by the tail.""
John's father double tapped the desk and the screen zoomed in on a system.
""This is the Sol System. They have a middle aged star with nine planets. The third one from the Sun harbors life. The people there are tiny and millions of years from possessing any sort of intellect. So, what's the point, dad, you may ask? Well son, these little guys have many religions. They like to fight over there beliefs and histories, but they don't realize they all follow the same religion. You see this number, it says 4:13 PM Eastern Time Zone. And over there it says 21:13 GMT. That is what they call time. They live their entire lives by these numbers. They tick and tock until they can't breathe anymore. Hahaha, its such a pity, because they really don't understand how meaning less ""time"" is. For instance, in our world, Tiy-sa, we organize our days around certain emotional needs. Everyday we need to satisfy our physical, sexual, spiritual and happiness needs before we call it a day. A strange species those humans. Tick-tock indeed.""",0
"I was twenty-one years old when I left for the mission. The youngest astronaut in the history of the United States; the youngest astronaut in the history of the earth. The year was 2025, and our technology had exceeded our wildest expectations. To go beyond the reach of our solar system it would take a mere six and a half years. A goal that just ten years ago would have been incomprehensible.
For the duration of the flight I was going to be put into a deep sleep chamber. A necessary precaution given that every bit of weight counted on this voyage. This was a first for all of mankind, and the planning of this trip was an enormous undertaking. Once I reached the fringes of our solar system I would be awoken by the timer on the chamber so that I could proceed with my mission. The instructions for this mission were not overly complex. It was to be a simple matter of gathering data about the conditions outside the solar system. Any and all data retrieved would be used to carry out further missions for different crews in the future.
The private corporation funding this mission had spent untold amounts of money on this endeavor, and they wanted to see their investments payoff. I had been training since my body was physically capable of handling the rigorous exercises undergone by astronauts. My technological expertise with this particular class of ship were extensive and almost bordering on microanalytical. I had no partners on this mission except one; the ships AI. The AI was one of the first of its kind considering the general public still scorned the idea of them. This particular AI had named itself Charon.
The day before I left I said goodbye to my parents. My mother was bawling, and could barely say a word. She hugged me so tight I thought she would never let go. My father was a different story.
""You'll be back kiddo."" He smiled. ""I've never been so proud of you.""
After a quick embrace between the two of us, and a couple more group hugs with both of them I headed back to my apartment one last time. I was ready.
The launch went smoothly thanks to the new design of rockets the corporation used. Before I knew it I was passing through the atmosphere saying goodbye to the only home I had known for twenty-one years. Once we had escaped the clutches of earth's gravity I leapt out of my seat, and experienced true weightlessness for the first time in my life. I giggled somewhat uncontrollably for a minute at the giddiness I felt. I propelled myself over to a window for one last glimpse of home. *I'll be back soon. *
""Engaging rotation function of ship arms. Artificial gravity will soon commence."" Charon chimed.
I set the timer on the side of the chamber and climbed in.
""Charon, if the timer fails to go off wake me in exactly six and a half earth years from this point."" I said.
""I will set my own timer right now and wake you as requested."" It replied in its familiar female voice.
The door on the chamber closed and sleep overtook me.
Voices and lights danced around me. Waves crashed on the beaches of forgotten islands. The music of a thousand cultures intertwined into one melody. Strange patterns and colors formed sacred geometric shapes. Odd figures with faces that were familiar, but thousands of years old, watched me. Dreams stretched into eons, eons into eternities, and eventually it's as if time stood still. And then I awoke.
The door opened on the chamber, and I crawled out, nauseated from the journey. The lights on the ship slowly flickered to life as I gathered myself on the cold metal floor. After the dizziness passed I made my way to the cockpit.
""It's good to see you Parker."" hummed Charon's voice ""Though you are a couple of days earlier than I expected. It's fascinating that you are so resilient, most humans have extreme difficulty moving after staying in the deep sleep chamber for a couple of days. Much less getting up after spending six and a half years in one.""
""They trained me well."" I gruffly replied. ""What's the status of the ship?""
""The ship is functioning at optimal levels, and we are ready to begin running tests whenever you give the word.""
""Alright then lets proceed with some of the basics. Start running diagnostics on the immediate area surrounding us, and let me know what you find."" I said
""No problem, I will let you know when that is completed."" It replied.
This was the general procedure for the months that we spent out there past the solar system. I would order a battery of tests, and Charon would report back with the results. Most came back negative with the exception of some spectroscopy reports on some nearby asteroids that had drifted by. This was to be expected though. The main purpose of this expedition was to see if this was a feasible operation that could be done. So far in that aspect it was a success. We would pave the way for future expeditions that could potentially bring colonies to other worlds in the not so distant future.
Once our given time had elapsed, and I presumed that we had collected all useful data I ordered Charon to take us home. As I climbed into the chamber I reminded Charon to wake me as I had previously, and I set the timer once more. The dreams returned.
Flashes of light streaked by. A black hole devoured a galaxy. Stars were born. A fire was kindled in a cave. I saw the birth and death of a thousand generations. I heard their cries. And then I awoke.
""Parker can you hear me?"" Charon said.
""Yeah I hear you."" I barely whispered hoarsely.
""We our currently in the Atlantic Ocean. Re-entry through earth's atmosphere was a success. Although I think you should have been awake for re-entry we arrived a few days ahead of schedule. And I did not wake you since you instructed me to wait exactly six and a half earth years.""
""Whatever Charon.."" I mumbled trying not to puke.
Once I got my wits about me Charon informed me that a crew was coming to retrieve us. They got there promptly, and we returned to base where I was put into quarantine for a mandatory seventy-two hours. Afterwards the true celebration began. I had done it; we had done it. This was one of the greatest achievements of mankind to date, and it put us that much closer to traveling to other solar systems.
On the day I was finally getting to leave headquarters I had one more quick encounter with the owner of the company, and the man behind the entire operation, Charles Lancaster.
""Parker!"" He shouted as I was walking out the front door.
I quickly spun on my heel, and went back through the door.
""Oh, Mr. Lancaster, hello."" I said in shock, as he had only ever met me personally once before when I had just started working for the company.
""I just wanted to personally commend you on your expedition."" He began. ""You have started something that will send all humans to places we have only dreamed about. That is something that is worthy of the highest honor in my book."" He beamed.
""Just doing my job, sir."" I replied shyly.
""Well you've done a damn good job, Parker."" He laughed. ""Now go home, and enjoy some time off. We'll take care of all the data you collected.""
""Thank you sir, will do."" I began to walk away.
""Oh, and Parker. One more thing."" He said.
I turned. ""Yes sir?""
""**Wake up. **""
It took me a second to process what he had said. I felt a tightening in my chest. My knees went wobbly. There was a sharp ringing in my ears. I started to fall, and then everything went black. Blinding lights and colors. Screaming voices. The pain was so intense I thought I was dying.
The door opened on the chamber, and I fell out. I puked everywhere. I stood up and immediately fell over. I was panicking; I couldn't make sense of what had just happened. My mind was refusing to accept it.
""Charon!"" I screamed. ""Charon!""
""Yes, Ms. Parker?"" That familiar voice chimed.
""How long have I been out?"" I sobbed.
""My systems indicate there was some sort of electrical malfunction before the six and a half year mark that turned the timer off. It also knocked me offline for that duration. The deep sleep chamber has kept you alive, and remarkably youthful as well. All systems have just now come back online. It appears we have been offline for about six-hundred years.""
I sat down and wept. I had been asleep for just over six-hundred years. Everyone I knew was gone. I was somewhere far past the solar system. Tears rolled down my face.
""Charon, send a message for me."" I quietly said through my tears.
""Yes ma'am."" She replied ""What would you like me to send?""
""This is Gwendolyn Parker, Earth's first astronaut to leave the solar system. If anyone can hear this I am still alive. End message.""",0
"""I was there when we left our home, all the way back in 20XX,"" I took a sip of my coffee since we've finally almost arrived at mankind's new home our supplies have started to dwindle, and there wasn't really enough coffee left to make a good cup.
""There were lots of us back then, but you know.. Two thousand years is a long time for a normal human being. The average lifespan back in 20XX was give or take 90, sometimes 100. Which probably sounds outrageous now as most of you will probably live till you're my age!"" Everyone laughed, they knew that was impossible.
You see, I'm immortal.
I lived my whole life before keeping my immortality a secret, but that's not easy when you're on a ship with hundreds of thousands of people for the next two thousand years..
It took them about 40 years to start speculating, as by then I was about 70, but I didn't look a day over 30. Even now, 2000 years later I don't want to come off as I'm bragging, but I might even get checked for ID if I were to go to the Market Sector and tried to buy a 6 pack of beer.
""I was there when you were born, and you were born, and when your parents were born, and even their parents. I could go on for 2000 years."" Everyone chuckled again.
""Did you ever get lonely?"" one of the children in the front row asked,
""You know, some people would think living forever might be a gift. I have made many friends, but I've lost just as many."" I pause for a moment. ""I've been in love, I've experienced all there is to life, and even the some more. Loneliness is just another part of life, as is love, heartbreak and death."" I take another sip of my coffee, ""And even still, if I could make the choice to make myself not live forever, I probably wouldn't. The human race interests me, seeing where we all began, and where we're about to end up I couldn't be more excited to experience the next 2000 years.""
""Ladies and gentlemen, if you are in the Lounge Sector of the ship look on your left to see the destination our ancestors have been routing us towards for the last 2000 years. Our new home, The Milky Way!"" The ship's intercom went off, and as did everyone else to go see their new home.
I took a moment to think, ""The Milky Way,"" why does that sound so familiar?

"Dragons flew, the sun bled over the sky as two lovers took hand in hand while the old man wrote his recollection. Lily stood upon the bridge looking to the ethereal darkness flowing in steady streams underneath. As she sent that last heartwarming text message to her only friend, lover, Ian looked a sharp eye at the unnerving humanoid beast that twisted and turned in its deformed shape, long unnerving nails sticking from its weathers hands like blades in the shadows. all those stories, all those poems, all those unique worlds coexisting within a single mind. a single universe, a beautiful fractal that overtook his imagination. as he touched the mechanical keyboard like a sea of words his worlds unleashed themselves from his mind. his overflowing head no longer needed to store all the tales that it gave birth to. as a flowing sea of words the tales fell, almost in perfect harmony, perfect motion, to the paper. Sentence after sentence, page after page. he didn't even need to think, it just came to him, a story in a completed form forming with what seemed no effort on the screen.
the mind looked around his empty room, at the books that piled up in his shelves and he had grown up with. he looked at the screen once more.
Maybe some day his own world will sit up on that shelf as well.",0
"""By the thousand teeth of Scrolith, Simon, it's *hiss, roar, roar, claw! *""
The basilisk looked crestfallen,
""Sorry. Thought it was hiss, claw, roar roar.""
I sighed through my long-dead teeth,
""How many months have we been rehearsing this?""
Simon's tail lashed sullenly.
*"" How many? ""*
He mumbled something unintelligible.
""That's right my lizardy friend, *three months*.""
""Sorry,"" he muttered again.
""By the Dark, it's four things Simon. *Four things! *""
I whirled away, my midnight cloak swirling around me imperiously. I'd been practising that for *years*.
Around the cavern scores of dark creatures stood, dressed in their full costumes.
""OK,"" I clapped my bony hands together with a *crack*, ""places everyone, let's take this from the top - cue the skeleton vanguard.""
A dozen skeletons skittered forward, dressed in gilded armour. I'd spent a small fortune on their outfits - carefully ageing the metal in sulphur vents to make them that much more authentic.
One skeleton stood awkwardly behind the others, naked.
""Fredrick!"" I snarled.
He shifted behind another skeleton.
""I can see you through his ribcage.""
Fred shifted back out. If a skull could look ashamed, his wore that expression.
*"" Where is your armour? ""*
His teeth began to chatter uncontrollably.
Another skeleton put up a golden-gloved hand,
""He lost it gambling with the orcs,"" the snitch growled.
Turning, I regarded the orcish blade-dancers.
""Tholo?"" I queried of the leader, wearing a golden helmet, vambraces and greaves.
""Hey man, I won this gear fair n' square.""
I fixed him with my burning blue eyes.
""Alright, whatever. I wanna get paid for it though."" He took the armour off and handed it to a still-shaking Fredrick.
I clapped my hands again,
""Let's begin. Ahem. *Skeleton horde, ATTACK! *"" I screeched theatrically.
With a chittering roar, they ran forward, swinging their golden scimitars.
""Good! Now, fall back as the heroes overpower you - don't worry, you'll be resurrected for scene three.""
Obligingly, the undead soldiers collapsed into neat piles of bones.
I mustered my *evil voice*,
""Curse you brave heroes! But you will be no match for the *BASILISK! *""
Simon stared blankly into space.
*"" Simon,"" * hissed one of the dark elves, ""you're up!""
The basilisk rattled forward,
""Oh right. Um, yeah! *Hisssssssss*"" he clawed the air, then roared twice.
The cavern fell silent as I placed my head in my hands.
It was going to be a *very* long night.",0
"""He looks so normal..."" A woman whispered; still loud enough to hear.
""This is before he snaps, what happened to him? He looks well enough. What happens in the next few weeks do you think?"" the second woman replied to the first.
I've had the feeling that people were watching me for some time. Since my child hood, strangers have gawked and stared at me as if I were some sort of spectacle. I would catch people taking pictures of me in public, and would often be frightened by the staring eyes. My parents thought I was overreacting, and told me to ignore it.
""Why would they be staring at you honey?""
Why indeed.
The women across from me were facing the opposite direction, but would casually glance at me over their shoulders when they thought I wasn't looking, but I was always watching them from the corner of my eye. They had entered the cafe shortly after I had, and they didn't order anything. Their focus was on me, and for once I had the courage to ask why.
""Excuse me. Why are you talking about me?"" I said to the strangers.
""Did he just -"" the first woman was interrupted by the second.
""What? No we aren't talking about you."" Said the second, nervously.
""I heard you, just now. Why are you here watching me?"" I said, standing up now. As I stood from my chair the strangers shrieked.
""Don't hurt us, PLEASE!"" The first said, sprinting with the second towards the door. I was dumbstruck. They had obviously been here to see me, and yet they were terrified of me. After a moment of confusion, I noticed the women had left their cellphones and purses at the table in their hurried leave. I approached the table and picked up one of their cellphones, curiously. It was huge; wider and taller than my Galaxy Note, and thicker than my wallet. I could see the added thickness of the phone was in part due to an attachment that snapped onto the back. I popped it off and the inside read ""Verizon 2010-2020 mobile adapter."" On the back of the phone itself read the phone's name as well. ""Samsung Universe 6X""
""What in the fuck..."" I remarked. These devices made no sense. I kept up to date with most technology and had never heard of this. It barely looked like a Samsung device, the buttons were wonky and the size was enormous. Turning the device to the screen side I pressed some of the unmarked buttons until the screen came on.
The device's date read March 25th, 2056.
At this point my brain was aching. All signs pointed to these women being from the future; they were here to see me as well. I set the phone down and turned back to my table, and I saw them through the windows. They must have realized they left their belongings in the fluster, and turned back to see if I was gone. This was my chance for some answers, and I wasn't going to ruin this opportunity. I bolted from the cafe towards the strangers. Realizing I was after them, they took their leave as well.
I wasn't very fast, but these women weren't either. They screamed at me to stop, but I needed to know. I had been waiting my entire life to know, and now might be the only chance to find out. I had caught up to one, and grabbed her arm. She reached towards her watch and pressed a button, while the other woman grasped her arm as well.
Everything was black, for a moment at least. Then everything was bright, even with my eyes closed, even with my hands over my eyes. The brightness was piercing through every part of my body. It didn't hurt, but I could feel the light pulsating through me. Then everything was dark again.
When I came to, I was holding the watch, in a different time and place than I had ever been before. Looking at the watch I struggled to find an undo button. I couldn't be here a moment longer. I couldn't be here a second longer. I found a button that read ""revert time"" and I pressed it immediately.
Everything was black again, then bright once more, and black again.
When I awoke I was in the streets were I grabbed the woman. The thoughts of that place were still ingrained into my mind. Stabbing my conscious with the images of that terrible place. Replaying over and over.
Nobody should have to go to that place.
Nobody should witness what I saw, I would make sure of that.
I would make damn sure of that.",0
"It all started like any other day really.
I can remember the time, it was 11:30a.m.
I was walking down the street, on my way to work.
The sun blindingly encompassed everything, so I had to pull out my sunglasses.
So, I'm fiddling around in my jacket pocket for them and just as I get my grip on the shades in question, I crash hard into a random passerby.
She was nice enough, she handed me my sunglasses, apologizing furiously.
Her eyes as I recall, were the most vivid cerulean.
Her body, was very sleek and shapely.
She had curves in all the right places.
Anyway,
We said our farewells.
Parting ways, never to see each other again, right?
A few years later, most of my family had passed away, save one crazy uncle named Dave.
No one in the family ever visited him, as he'd murdered my aunt a few years back.
They didn't lock him up, not in jail anyway unfortunately for him.
The lawyer on his case got him off on an insanity plea.
Which, if we're being honest, he was.
He snapped.
He and my aunt were in the store.
She asked him if he wanted roast for dinner.
According to two witness accounts and the store security tape, it was at that moment he decided to strangle her to death with one of those bags specifically for vegetables and fruits.
It was brutal.
I always wondered what was going on in his head at the time.
It had to be something pretty powerful to do that to someone he loved.
I felt sorry for him.
So, after my mom's funeral I decided to head to the ""hospital"" they were keeping him in.
Oddly enough, I walk in and there she was.
Those eyes.
I could have spotted them out of a police line up.
They were etched into my skull, she recognized me too.
So we say our hellos, that's when she asks why I'm here.
Well of course it would have been sly and potentially swoon worthy, had I said something like; ""I looked you up, because that day we met when we crashed into each other, I fell madly in love with you."" However that was simply not true.
I didn't know this woman, I didn't care about this woman.
She was just another face.
As far as I knew she felt nothing for me either.
We were strangers after all.
So, I answered truthfully.
""I'm here to see my uncle.""
She looked shocked. The kind of shock a person gets when you tell a slightly off-color joke, or the second in between burping and saying excuse me.
She asked me his name, I told her.
She then informed me he'd passed away just that morning.
Now, I don't know if it was the fact that I'd lost mom rather recently, or that I really truly felt sorry for Dave. Not one visitor in 10 years, just slowly stewing on his thoughts.
Then finally someone's coming to visit. Somewhere in the afterlife I imagine he's either really pissed or laughing his ass off.
Someone came to visit, and before he could see them, he dies.
A tear began to fall, I wiped it away pretending I was rubbing my eyes.
She looked concerned.
She took my hand and led me to a chair in the waiting room.
That was her job, to console people here.
Well that and receptionist duties.
We talked, and basically exchanged life stories.
Apparently she'd had a rough road as well.
Orphan, abused by most of her adoptive families in one way or another.
At any rate, we decided to talk more.
We exchanged cell phone numbers, and began texting one another for about a month or so.
We would hang out and watch movies, we weren't really dating, just being friendly.
Well one day out of the blue, she decides to ask me out.
I agree, because I had grown rather fond of her by now, we were best friends.
What could go wrong?
A few years pass, and we're happy still and doing all those gross romantic things that guys pretend to hate around other guys even though we really enjoy them.
We had our fights like any other couple.
Stupid little arguments, but those eyes...
I started to grow more and more distant towards her as time passed.
I watched the life and hope slowly dissipate from her lovely eyes.
We were killing each other.
No, that's not right.
I was killing her...
It was like watching a movie of us to me.
I could see what I was doing, and how it hurt her, but I just couldn't snap myself out of it.
I couldn't talk to her.
She'd always try to come back with something positive, and it made me sick.
I wanted to shout at her. That being a damn optimist wasn't going to solve anything.
It got under my skin so badly.
One day, she got some terrible news.
A friend of hers had passed away, she was devastated.
I could see it, she was literally coming undone.
This was going to bury her.
I thought, ""Maybe I should say something, or do something.""
A part of me wanted to. I wanted to help this beautiful creature I had fallen in love with, so badly.
A bigger part of me, the part that consumed me, didn't even care.
I felt so guilty, that a part of me just couldn't even muster up enough effort to say anything to this girl.
I tried.
""I love you, I'm so sorry."" I hugged her awkwardly, and then left for work.
Well she seemed strange for some time, but months went by and things went back to normal.
Her eyes didn't shine like they used to, but I thought we were doing well.
Then she stopped saying it.
She stopped saying ""I love you.""
I was worried, but thought maybe she's preoccupied.
I began saying it first, she'd say it back,
I'd ask her to promise, we'd go about our business.
I leave for work on a Friday.
I come back around 12, her car's gone when I arrive.
Okay, that's normal she must be out with a friend.
I walk in, set my things in the floor, get myself a Diet Mountain Dew.
Something feels off, but I can't quite tell why.
I look around the house things seem to be missing.
I go into the living room and it's barren. Like I missed an apocalypse.
I walk into the computer room, and on the desk is a note.
It's from her.
Basically saying how because of me, she had to leave, and thought we'd both be better off.
I wept.
I wanted to beg and plead and bring her back.
But the more I thought, the more I blamed her.
""screw her. ""I said.
I'll never date again.
I thought I loved this woman so much, but I didn't treat her right.
I was a jackass.
I hate that I'm an asshole, I hate that she's gone...
And I hate her.",0
"The darkened scenery flashed by outside the window of the train, but I paid it very little heed. Fields are pretty and all, but when you're bored out of your mind on a five-hour long journey, it's easy to feel like sheep are the bane of your existence.
Especially if you're tired on a train. You don't want to be counting sheep if you're trying to stay awake, right?
I checked my phone for any new messages. Nope; my friends were ignoring me. Or they had gone to bed. Whatever. Free wifi was one of the perks of taking the train instead of a car or a bus, but what was the point of it when there was nothing interesting on the internet? The little charge bar in the corner read charging. It was up to three bars now - half power. With four hours to go it was likely it would be fully done by the time I got off, and I would have snagged a free phone charge just by being in the right place at the right time.
The lights in the carriage were dimmed, and the blue-white glare of my phone was likely the only thing keeping me up. Sighing, I turned it off and stored it in my pocket. I should at least get some rest, even though I no longer liked sleeping on trains. I set my watch alarm for three and a half hours later, and rested my head against the curtain bundled at the edge of the window: a makeshift pillow.
The glare of the screen was still a square burned into my retinas, but it soon began to fade into the grey nothingness of eigengrau. Little dots of colour sparked on and off and swirled about and formed the coca-cola logo which dissolved into nothing before reforming again in the shape of another brand.
This was the worst thing about sleeping on trains. The rapid variance of magnetic fields they put over the whole thing charges any electrical devices you have for indefinite use, but the whole thing is paid for by using those same fields to transmit subliminal adverts into your head. Ethically dubious, but approved by the Transport board three years ago and now you find no train without them. To be honest, nobody cares.
Only, when there's no other source of images those subliminal messages translate into your conscious mind and you see them. It's distracting and I hate it. I just want to sleep. I don't want to watch mindless repetitions of logos that are meant to build up brand familiarity. I want to sleep.
Sleep sounds good. Sleep...
That night I dreamed I was being chased by a giant Coca-cola bottle.",0
"The news stations shut down the day they came. All of them. All at once. Then all the television stations blipped out of existence. Then the internet. The electricity was the last to go. It was like they were sending us back in time. I guess they didn't want us to communicate with each other, like they didn't want us to know what was going on. They wanted us in the dark, alone.
Some people started fleeing at the first sight of the ships. They packed up their belongings, grabbed their kids and started running down the street, or getting into their cars and pushing through the mounds of traffic that lined every city corner. Where they were going I don't know. Maybe a police station, or an army base. Some place they felt safe.
Other people looted the vacant shops and houses, breaking windows, fighting over cans of string beans and loaves of bread. Playing tug a war with their lives over canned vegetables. People got shot, beat up, left to die out in the debris-filled streets or on the sidewalks. All the while the ships watched over us from above.
Then one day, as I awoke from a fitful night in my small apartment, I suddenly had a strong urge to peek through the splintered boards of my living room window, into the outside world to gaze up at the ships that I had stared at many times before.
But they weren't there. They were just...gone. The sky was clear, the sun shone down into my eyes. Everything was still: peaceful almost.
I grabbed the axe that had laid beside me on my nightstand for a month now and began to hack away the wooden boards that covered my front door. I heard nothing but my heart in my ears.
Once the boards gave way, I cautiously opened the door and stepped out into the light. I squinted in the sudden onslaught of blue sky, dots sparkling over my vision. Where were the ships? Where had they gone?
I could see a few other people peeking out of their fortresses. Curtains were moved aside; doors were unlocked and people stepped out onto their front steps just like I had done. The silence grew. It was almost more unwelcome then the ships themselves.
Then I heard it, a slow drum like beat. It didn't seem to be coming from the day outside, but more from inside me. I could tell others felt it too, their faces twisting into the same confused expression that must line my face at this very instant. We clutched our chests but it wasn't our heart that was beating in time, it was something else.
Something was happening. Something was wrong. The ships weren't here anymore but the creatures who manned them still were. Something deep down in my core told me so. They were here and they were coming for us.",0
"I was the odd one out growing up, ostracized to the point where I felt being ignored was a normality; I was not good enough for other people. That's why they ignored me, spit in my direction, and shot glares across play grounds as though they were 50 caliber bullets attempting to pierce my frail, childlike body. Perhaps it was my scars that made them do this to me. I thought I hid them well, yet maybe they still knew. Maybe they thought it was me who carved those scars into my skin, but it wasn't.
Perhaps if I told them it wasn't me, maybe I would have had companions to pull me out of my darkness. Maybe if I told them how a knife slash is normal in a house filled with hate rather than love. Yet I didn't, and instead I was faced with sorrow so deep that it sank into my bones and hollowed them out. An ever-pervasive pity that took root in the very core of my being. Confining me to the recesses of mind, with no will to do anything other than die, but not brave enough to go through with it. Living, that is my punishment for not being good enough for other people; and it will haunt me forever.",0
"The teenage neophyte towered over the wizened old wizard, but seemed to shrink within himself until he was but a four-year old boy caught stealing sugar cane sticks.
""Um...I think there were...like...two or three...""
""Two? Or Three? Gods above, you blithering idiot, can you not tell me whether it was two dragons you saw, or three? It's not hard!"" The wizard held up two gnarled fingers in his left hand and shook them upwards at the cowering boy. Electric sparks sizzled and crackled between the fingers. ""Here's two!"" He held up three bony, bent fingers in his right hand, tiny luminous dust clouds popping off in micro-fireballs around them. ""Here's three! Damn you, how many was it?""
""...score...""
""Shit.""",0
"Deep under the underground levels of Archive Prime, in a room shielded by a meter thick wall of solid steel, the latest findings of the Machine Intelligence Program were to be revealed in a meeting so clasified even the two participants would not be allowed to remember it, and would need to imbibe some secretitive formula to prevent long term memories thereof.
The high ranking agents, wearing such expensive black suits and such authentic designer sunglasses that they could have been casted in any espionage movie straight away, examined each other in silence for about ten minutes, their emotionless faces betraying nothing.
Finally the younger man was content to begin: ""Sir, we are certain, a corpus never lies"". The subtlest brow raise by the authority figure invited him to continue. ""Sir, we trained the machine up on a collection of Star Wars novels and fan fiction. As you know the Rebel Alliance did the Empire in from the shadow with terrorist attacks and a campaign of propaganda and deception"".
Another pregnant pause filled the room with foreshadowing tension before the operative continued. ""Sir, we then asked the machine to analyze all the writings we have from the Roman era, so as to locate what brought down that mighty empire. The result terrified us, but we thought it must be a mistake. We tried again with other bodies of data from different historic periods, but correlation is at 100% percent. ""
""Sir, it is the Christians. This sect was involved in every single collapse of empire in recorded history. Their rise coincides with the Romans' downfall, their machinations bring about the 30 years war, they cause enormous trouble in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republic, widely recorded in all manner of official documents, they even are involved with the sabotage and violent overthrow of the Empire of Japan, though there are hardly any Christians there. ""
The older agent sighed and took off his glasses. ""It's worse than you think. They got into this room. ""The two exchanged a knowing look, then he went on. ""We must let the president know. ""
""We can't risk the official channels, sir. Our analysis puts Christian infiltration of even secure organizations at above 60%. ""
""Right. This is a Code Red operation"". He pushed a hidden button in his desk. ""Sally, please come in"". ""Yes sir, Mr. Smith"". a pleasant voice retorted over the intercom.
The secretary made her entrance to the sound of massive steel doors rolling open in perfect silence. ""Sally, how would you deliver a secret message to the president if you couldn't trust anyone?""
""Why sir, I'd do it myself, my boyfriend is on the president's staff and we get together in the presidential apartment all the time. In fact, I pretty much deliver a message for you every week. ""
""Hush, that's extremely classified. You aren't allowed to know that, in fact we aren't allowed to know that, but that's OK since we'll forget it soon enough. ""He took out a post-it stack and wrote the message down then handed it to the girl. As she left the older man took out a non-descript bottle and two small glasses and poured. The two started to drink in silence.
Later that day, a casual post-it note would stick casually on a certain fridge door patiently waiting for President Obama's attention. ""Sir, it is the Christians, do not believe their lies"".",0
"Your message was shocking for all of us, it used any taught plane as a speaker so that every window, metal panel and strung wire had screamed it out, we noted after international communications had been restored that it came in the form of the local language everywhere, simply figuring out how that was done had been the subject of much debate for years afterwards.
Now that we knew there was something to look for we spotted some, maybe all, of your technology that drifted round the Sol system.
When we pinpointed the broadcast location in Mercury, so long thought to be a planet, now turned out to be a solar power plant, we discovered the directed energy beams that pulsed off it with mathematical regularity those allowed us to find the rest.
The Kuiper belt turned out to have millions of drone satellites circling in it, whether the satellites or the belt came first has not been determined, but that it was one of these that killed Voyager was not in debate. Spectroscopic analysis of the beam that killed our first extra solar""ship"" showed us whole new vistas of wavelengths and frequencies and immediately both regressed and massively advanced our understanding of the universe.
For the first decade we panicked as new discoveries and the realization of your overpowering technology was uncovered day after day, Saturns rings were found to contain uncountable nanites, Jupiter had several""somethings"" lurking deep in the gas layers and on and on, with each power transfer from Mercury we found some new, and horrifying.
So we worked, feverishly, to try and counter each new discovery. We launched massive radiation cannons to fire focused x-rays at the nanites and sunder their atomic bonds, we used every nuke on the planet to bombard the 13 Jupiter locations until Mercury no longer tried to charge them, these and a thousand other plans and schemes were launched some successful, some not. The Moon has proved particular difficult as it seems to be a massive piece of machinery that we dare not attack as forcefully as is needed lest we doom ourselves with radioactive bombardment, now we walk its surface in the thousands digging and prying trying to exploit its mechanical depths and destroy it from within. We have not yet managed to enter it but even scratching the surface has revolutionized the sciences of chemistry and metallurgy, indeed most of the new weapon systems being made rely on the alloys and materials the saboteurs so carefully pry free.
Since the""frantic 30's"" the Earths people have calmed and the threat of an outer power has united us in ways never dreamed of by even the most idealistic of politicians, war after all is good for the economy and we are facing a war unlike any ever dreamt. We have united under one government and one language, Esperanto for so long a joke is now how scientists and engineers the world over share their thoughts and advances and the general population is quickly following suit. Massive engines of war have been created and sadly in our desperation for materials many rare and vulnerable species have been destroyed though we have saved as many seeds and as much D.N.A as possible, should we win we will bring them forth again. We have conquered disease and are close to becoming functionally immortal so much the better to build weapons and crew ships, and the ships themselves...massive daggers of barely contained fusion power that even as we speak race to the Kuiper belt to see what may be done.
Now our thoughts turn to you, whomever you should be that threaten us from the sky, we know that Mercury beamed a tremendously powerful signal upon Voyagers destruction and we know the star that the signal travels to. Constrained as it is by light we know that we have another 63 years before it reaches you and we thought you should know what have accomplished and how much of your technology we have defeated in a mere 27 years. You may be already on the way to us when you receive this trailing broadcast but the Earth and all its people want to tell you with one voice""Come fucking get some!"".",0
"It had been just another night, Jack remembered. He had a particularly good time playing Dota 2 with several friends he met recently through the game. Shutting off his computer, he stood up, tired from a long day, to perform his usual bedtime routine.
Looking in the mirror while brushing his teeth, he couldn't help but think about how he had been a disappointment. How he lost his only girlfriend and prospective wife to drugs and lies. He had been sober for a year now, but it didn't make him feel any more alive. He stood there, toothbrush unmoving in his mouth, lamenting his nonexistent social life and lack of female interaction. ""If only I could meet a nice girl somewhere, I'd be doing alright"" he thought.
His work consumed him, and he knew it. Working for an oil company had him traveling to remote places for long periods of time, and tonight was a rare evening home in his cozy apartment on the outskirts of Denver. He was excited to get a good rest in a nice, comfortable bed, instead of a lumpy monstrosity he is accustomed to finding in various hotels in small towns across the midwest.
As he is checking his front door to make sure it is locked, he notices his hallway light flicker. A thought graces his mind about a lazy repairman before the light grows increasingly bright then bursts in a surprisingly loud BANG. Intrigued, Jack decided to investigate the unusual occurrence.
Walking outside, he finds himself shivering uncomfortably, despite the 80 degree summer night temperature. Looking around, he sees nothing unusual, save for the broken lightbulb flashing on and off several times per second. He made a note to report it to the front desk the next morning.
Maybe it was because it was dark, or maybe it was because Jack was exhausted, but he did not see the dark shape approaching from his peripheral until it was too late. All he noticed was a sharp, stifling smell in the air before he lost consciousness.
Jack awoke to find himself laying in his bed, waking just before his alarm signaled it was time for him to return to his busy life as an employee for a large company. As he walked out of his apartment long before the sun would rise, he couldn't shake the thought that the hallway light bulb was broken the night before.",0
"""Introducing- the one, the only, the Theeeerrrrafiiiiiiiiiist!""
The crowd roared. Lights flashed. The Therafist grinned.
""And in the other corner, ladies and gentlemen we have a real treat for you tonight- the depression of Ray Wilks, an office worker in rainy Seattle!""
The red humanoid figure sitting in the opposite corner looked up and sniffed, standing up to look around at the crowd. It lethargically removed its shirt, revealing rippling muscles and the word ""DEPRESSION"" in large black letters across its chest. It stood still, unblinking for a few seconds until the jeers died down.
The Therafist cracked his knuckles and raised his arms to the crowd, eliciting more cheers. He was going to beat the *shit* out of depression.
The announcer droned on and finally the bell rang.
With a sigh, the red figure stepped forward and put up its hands in some sort of half-assed block. The Therafist gave him a quick one-two and followed up with a wild right hook that knocked the creature back into the ropes.
They always made it too easy. He stepped forward to finish it off- and was slammed into the mat, his breath crushed out of him.
""Oooh, that's gotta hurt. Looks like we've got a surprise tag-team, ladies and gentlemen!""
The Therafist turned his head to look at what was on top of him. A large, fat figure, like a grey sumo wrestler, lay on top of him with a bored expression. 'APATHY' was scrawled across his blobby pectorals. Therafist squirmed, but it was no use. He couldn't move.
Depression walked up to him and unexcitedly began kicking him in the face. Four, five kicks, and his blood was splattering in front of him.
Suddenly, he was hauled to his feet. He was still held from behind by Apathy. A slim green figure outside of the ring, 'SELF DOUBT', tossed a chair to Depression, who slammed the Therafist in the head with it. He was down, Apathy on top of him again. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. The chair hit him in the head until one of the bolts gave and it fell to pieces.
The Therafist was in a bad way. He wanted to give up, to tap out, to surrender and make it stop, but Apathy wouldn't let him. His arms were pinned. He blacked out for a moment.
Apathy, thinking him done, shifted his weight to stand- and that's when the Therafist made his move. He bucked, kicking Apathy straight in the temple, and the creature fell. He jumped with a crazy, desperate uppercut, catching Depression in the jaw. The creature fell to one knee. The Therafist again stepped forward- CRACK. Something gave out and he fell. He looked at his feet and saw, to his horror, his leg was sticking out at an unnatural angle. Self Doubt stood over him with a crowbar.
Apathy lumbered over, grabbing one of his arms and holding him up. Self Doubt grabbed the other. Depression was right in front of him, and there was nothing he could do as he was beaten near senseless. The last thing the Therafist saw was Depression standing on the corner pole of the ring, and then jumping up to slam on top of him.",0
"They jokingly called us the Breakfast Club.
Us being the perennially underfunded Robert E. Lee High School debate team, or what was left of it after our coach—the former Ms. Cynthia Alverez—suddenly eloped with the billionaire she had met while reaching for grapes at the local Whole Foods. (I'm told the story of their meeting is very cute, but he was also fifty-two to her twenty-six, so I was not exactly sympathetic when she emailed us about ""pursuing her great love"" and left us in the lurch three months before State.) Anyway, after she left and the administration still hadn't hired a new coach six weeks later, most of the underclassmen bailed until next year, which just left us six seniors.
Therefore, when Bramford suggested we go on retreat to his uncle's cabin, I figured we would mostly just get drunk and maybe half heartedly organize bins and practice IEs. I had basically checked out by that time—my college acceptance letter to Barnard already framed on the wall, my last Cheer ribbon pinned on the corkboard next to it—so I was more or less just going along for the team. After all, I only joined debate my freshman year in order to pad my resume for college, but had discovered that I was a halfway competent CXer (something my dad found endlessly amusing: ""Well at least all those years of gabbing at high speed to those friends of yours on the phone was useful for something."") and so four years later I found myself helping Gabriel, my partner in all things policy debate, load camping supplies into the back of my silver SUV.
Gabe and I are pretty different. I have no idea what I want in life since none of my family had made it past high school until now and I had already achieved everything my mother wanted of me—besides being engaged—by becoming Prom queen, but he was already looking past CMU to his projected future in Silicon Valley and attended hackathons in his free time. But, we knew each other well after being partners for years and spent the entire hour long car ride in a comfortable silence, the radio tuned to our NPR member station.
Despite being half-asian, Bram was your stereotype of the a good ole Southern boy—fishing and being The Generals' tight end were his real passions in life and he only joined the team because his mother had insisted—so I resigned myself to a weekend of not being able to use my blow dryer or receive cell phone signal when we pulled up to a cabin that was only notable for its Walden-like sparseness. Lexi and the others had already arrived earlier and Bram was already flipping patties on the small grill.
Lex was co-captain of the team, our resident overachiever in a group of overachievers, and had joined debate out of a genuine nerdy love for competitive arguing. She also did public with Bram and lusted after him with an all consuming passion that I thought mostly came from the fact that it would feed her vanity if he—who was a stratosphere away socially—suddenly declared his undying love for her. Although, in their partnership, she might be the main brains of the operation, but he was the charming public speaker, his voice deep and smooth to her agitated chatter.
When I went to drop my bags inside—which was actually well furnished to my relief—Raven was curled up on one of the couches with a book and she raised one hand in a wave when I came in before turning her attention back to Nabokov. Raven wasn't actually her real name. She had gone through a goth phase in junior high and, when her family had moved from down from the North her sophomore year of high school, she had thought to remake herself by telling everyone her name was Raven. Although she had moved on to wearing oversized denim jackets and listening to obscure bands, she still kept the name and the heavy winged liner. She actually didn't debate and was on the team just to do Poetry and Prose.
If you're keeping up with the Breakfast Club analogy—which Francine my co-captain on the squad came up with during lunch one day and repeated to basically everyone she knew because she thought it was *so* clever—that just leaves Jonathan. Or as Francine said multiple times that week, ""Sam and Lexi are, like, both the Princess and Jonathan is the Criminal because he's black!"" I don't think she meant to be intentionally racist, but Jon told me he's turning it into an anecdote for an essay he's writing for the Huffington Post on microaggressions he's experienced while living in a suburban, majority-white neighborhood. Jon does LD and is planning on becoming a lawyer and getting the hell out of the South. He, like the rest of us, joined the team because it was the only academic extracurricular that was offered.
Despite everything, we all liked each other fine and by nightfall were sprawled together on the couches before the fire, comfortably drunk on Bram's uncle's bourbon stash.
""You know,"" Jon said, standing up and swaying slightly. ""I shouldn't be surprised by now, but can we talk about how there's a wolf head mounted over the fireplace?""
""It's kind of messed up, dude,"" Raven piped in.
""There's actually a family legend about that,"" Bram said. ""Something about an ancient curse, the full moon, the Mayan calendar and...I'm too drunk to make more shit up.""
Lex groaned dramatically and elbowed him, strategically moving herself closer to my amusement. I myself was curled up next to Raven underneath a wool blanket, my head pillowed on her shoulder, increasingly unable to keep my eyes open. In fact, I was almost asleep when Gabe stood up to refill his red cup, tripped over the rug and slammed into the mounted wolf head, the the sharp teeth breaking skin on his forehead and knocking his glasses askew.
""Oh shit!"" Bram jumped up, disentangling himself from Lex—*they were cuddling? * I thought blearily—and used a corner of his flannel shirt to wipe the small amount of blood seeping from the wound. Everything that happened after was a bit of a blur to me, at least until the wolf mounted on the mantle, its right canine coated in blood, opened its eyes and howled. Then I was suddenly very awake.
After everyone had stopped cursing in alarm and terror, Jon said shakily, ""Samantha, my girl, you know this means we're going to die first.""
A howl echoed in the distance, punctuating his statement.
I was already trying to dial 911 and swore when there was no cell signal. Bram whipped out a shotgun from whatever pocket dimension he had it in and fired a shot into the snarling wolf head, silencing it, while Raven filmed it on her phone—"" just in case this is a hallucination"" —and Lex picked up a poker from the rack.
""Ignoring the complete impossibility of what just happened,"" Gabe was now holding a napkin to his forehead. ""I think we have two options. We try to barricade ourselves in here or we can try to run.""
""I'm *not staying here with that thing*,"" Lex said hysterically, fumbling for her keys.
""Hold on,"" Jon said. ""Haven't you seen the movies? We have to stick together otherwise everyone's going to die except Gabe and Lex like some morality play about how we should do our homework and *it's bad to be a slut or black! *""
""Let's all grab weapons and take my car,"" I said. ""I have the most space and we should leave now to get ahead of whatever is going on.""
We all hurried to arm ourselves. Bram shoved a pistol into his backpack, tossing me its twin which I tucked in my purse, but didn't let anyone else touch the gun cache saying to the others, ""Realistically, with no gun training, you guys would be more likely to shoot yourselves.""
Bram also flicked on a flashlight as we hurried out together, the howling moving ever closer. The car beeped twice as I disengaged the locks and slid into the driver's seat. My palms were sweaty as I shoved the key in the ignition and flicked on the headlights, the others sliding pell mell into the back. Bram had circled around the car to ride shotgun, but suddenly his flashlight jerked away, its light arcing into the night air before toppling into the bushes. A shadow streaked past the front of the car. Someone in the back screamed and I was swearing now but barely registering it as I gunned the car in reverse and swerved it, my headlights turning to illuminate a massive wolf crouched over Bram's still body lying in the gravel, its muzzle wet with his blood.
For a moment I thought about just driving away, but I suppose in the end I was a bit of an idiot after all. But not that much of an idiot. I judged the angle and drove my SUV right at the wolf and prayed that Bram's arms were close enough to his sides. The wolf hit the bumper hard enough to dent before bolting into the bushes with a whine and, as I turned the car, Gabe had already jumped forward into the front seat. He opened the door and quickly dragged Bram inside, seconds ticking away as we listened to growls in the distance. My heart was moving in uncontrolled jerks by the time he slammed the door and I drove off as quickly as I dared in the dark.
Hitting the wolf had maybe damaged something, as I felt an unfamiliar rattle near the front of the car and it seemed like the very trees were leaning down into us to block our escape. I forced myself to ignore everything and focus on the road as, next to me, Gabe staunched the gash on Bram's shoulder and talked about hot button political issues in an attempt to keep him awake. I don't think any of us breathed until I eased onto the interstate. Then the doubts about what had happened started to slide in and we all snuck periodic glances at Bram in order to verify that it had been real.
We were silent as Lex pulled up directions to the nearest hospital on her phone.
It shouldn't be a surprise that we didn't go to State, as Bram spent the next month in the hospital and, without debate to hold us together, we all steadily drifted apart. The last time we were all together was a graduation when our mothers took a group photo of us—arms linked together and smiling.",0
"I thought this was a fantastic read. I really enjoyed how you intertwined the beginning of the story with Markus and snippets of the interview. I really enjoyed the pacing of the story. If anything, I agree with other people that this would have benefited from being longer. A lot of people have mentioned that they would have liked to see the mystery expanded upon, but I think expanding on the ending would be nice. I was surprised how quickly Markus sent a report back at the end - it didn't seem like a complete report.
But really, though, I found this to be a gripping tale and loved every moment of this story. I simply wanted to read more! Good luck!",0
"*… fully operational. Repeat, the experiment is fully operational! *
Topluk hunched over the communicator and tapped frantically at the controls. Even encrypted as it was, sending the message over all available channels was a clear breach of protocol… but this was too big, too potentially disastrous to risk the message not getting through. His cerebral implants hummed softly as they synced with the device in front of him and uploaded both his warning and his memory logs. The lights in the tunnel dimmed slightly as the communicator opened a miniscule singularity and established a connection with the listening post a few light years away. One minute passed, then another.
He felt the chill of the voice before he heard it.
*Acknowledged. *
His implants went dead and Topluk tucked the device away. Swallowing the bile at the back of his throat, he walked back into the control room amid raucous hollering. One of the humans charged at him, teeth bared, and Topluk flinched instinctively. The human stopped short and wrapped its arms around him, uttering a barking laugh as it did so. ""We did it, Paul! We actually fucking did it!""
Topluk bared his teeth in a smile. *Such repulsive creatures, * he thought as he shook the human's hand. ""That we did.""
The human turned his attention to a monitor nearby. ""Counter-clockwise circuit is almost complete. Had some fluctuations with the cryogenics a few minutes ago, but everything's running great now."" He turned back to Topluk, frowning. ""You feeling alright, Paul? You look a little green.""
""Fine,"" Topluk replied. ""Just more excitement than I'm used to."" A familiar hum echoed in his mind. ""I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat,"" he said as he edged toward the door.
The human nodded. ""I'll catch up in a few.""
It was everything Topluk could do not to sprint down the hall. As soon as he found a secluded nook, he fished out the communicator and downloaded the message from Central command.
*Projections revised. Prognosis dire. Completion of project ahead of our predictions suggests underestimation of human ingenuity and perseverance. Immediate action required. *
As the plan filtered into his mind, Topluk nodded. It would buy them some time, at least. He just hoped it would be enough.

""Bringing LHC sectors online now.""
The small crowd of physicists was silent, watching the monitors anxiously. Topluk stood with them, watched with them, but he was anxious for an entirely different reason.
""Sectors one, six, and seven at nominal field strength.""
The crowd murmured excitedly. Topluk felt a bead of sweat trace its way down his forehead, but ignored it.
""Two and eight on their heels.""
Time crawled to a halt. Five down, three to go. *Please, * Topluk thought. *Please. *
""Sector five is up and running!""
The murmuring intensified into a low buzz. A klaxon cut over them, and between pulses of the blaring horn Topluk heard disappointed groans.
""Magnetic quench in sectors three and four. God *damnit. *""
Topluk feigned disappointment as he fought to keep a grin from his face. Hands in his pockets, he strode from the control room and keyed the communicator.
*Sabotage successful. *
*Acknowledged, * came the reply. *With perseverance and ingenuity metrics revised, we estimate a minimum two month downtime. Stand by for further instructions. *
He sat back, resting his head against the wall. *Dangerous creatures, these humans. They breathe a poisonous gas, drink large quantities of a polar solvent, can sustain massive physical trauma and survive. They've spent most of their brief existence conquering each other and the planet they live on. If they learn the secrets of the universe, they'll do the same. *
*Earth is their cradle. For the sake of all life, everywhere, it must also be their grave. *",0
"I was having a pretty normal vacation until today. I was lying at the beach, browsing Reddit and getting a tan. Suddenly, everything got dark and before I knew it, I heard the sound of a huge explosion and a lightning bolt flashed in front of my face. The shock traveled through my body and I fell to the ground.
I remember waking up in the emergency room of a hospital with a doctor standing beside carrying some papers. As I regain consciousness, I feel different in a way I can't explain. The doctor tells me that I'll be fine and that no serious injuries occurred, thankfully. As I resume normal life, I feel infinite, like I can do anything if I set my mind to it. As I enter my house, everything seems to fall into place and I take a mental inventory of my life upto this point. This all happens in an instant.
I observe my surroundings, immediately, I notice everything wrong with my place and my body acts of its own mind and begins cleaning my apartment. I had wanted to do this at some point in my life, but now, I feel like there is no excuse for me not to do this. Fifteen minutes later, everything about my room seems so perfect and it looks like a place I would want to live the rest of my life in. I lay on my couch for a while, but I am restless. I want to do something, the first things that comes to mind is writing. Yeah, I am a writer, and yeah, I have not written a single word the past year. As I begin to write, everything seems to happen automatically. I put one word in front of another until I have written an entire chapter. When I glance at the clock, I realize how much time has passed, I was so lost in writing that time passed me by really quickly.
Immediately, I put on my workout clothing and go to the gym. As I walk there, I am thinking about how perfect of a day this will be. I am loving this. I am careful not to over-train as it is my first day but after the workout is finished, I feel a sense of accomplishment and this makes me really happy. A huge smile spreads across my face and I feel infinite.
On my walk back home, I think of all the relationships in my life and how I was so careless about them. I make a decision to remedy this, I call up my best friend who I had not talked to for about a month and make plans to meet up at a nearby cafe. At first, he is a bit reluctant and aggressive about me not returning his calls. I apologize for my actions and explain to him how I want to maintain our friendship. I genuinely believed what I said.
I inquire about new developments in his life, how his wife and children are, how the new android application he is developing is working out. He seems to have changed a lot and appears happier. He tells me about his exciting adventures and how he works from home now and travels the world with his family. During the conversation, I, suddenly start to feel miserable. I try to cut the meeting short by claiming that I forgot about the important meeting I have tomorrow morning and I have to go to bed early. He seems completely okay with this and leaves me alone.
As I walk home, my head is constantly tilted down, not like in the morning, when it was proudly up. Tears start falling from my eyes for no reason I can think of. I begin to see everything negatively and believe that I was never truly happy at any point in my life, even today. As I enter my room, I close the lights and sit on my bed in darkness. I just want to think about my life. I start to think that today I was not me but someone else. I felt like an impostor. Suddenly, this feeling that life will not get any better in the future started to surface. Rationally, I knew this was not true but emotionally I was convinced. I don't want to continue on living, I think to myself, if this is what life is. Life is meaningless, I tell to myself, the universe doesn't care about you and that I am not a unique and special snowflake, that I am insignificant in the grand scheme of thing. The only honorable thing to do would be to kill myself, only in death can we be heroes. When I woke up, I never knew that suicide would be the thing I would set my mind to, but we don't always get what we wish for. I proceed to jump out of my apartment window while keeping my eyes closed so that I do not back down from my decision.",0
"""The exploders creep me out.""
""They prefer to be called humans.""
""Yeah? And I'd prefer to be called the Uber-Admiral of the 5th fleet. Doesn't change the fact that those things are obsessed with explosions.""
""Are you talking about nuclear weapons? Plenty of pre-FTLs have come up with those. I mean, even we went through times of violence and destruction.""
""Yes, we've been violent, and yes, we've blown things up. Still, we've never felt the need to include explosions in every single significant invention we've ever come up with.""
""I don't follow.""
""Have you read my report on the Internal Combustion engine?""
""I skimmed it.""
""It's a way to propel their vehicles using explosions. They're asinine. Hear about their firearms? They're ranged weapons that fling projectiles with explosions.""
""Doesn't seem like it would be the most accurate...""
""Oh, they figured out a way for it to work. They just couldn't tolerate having anything like that centered around elasticity or magnetism...just had to include an explosion in there.

"I promised I would never abandon her. With tears in her eyes and scars on her arms, she would blame me. I was the reason she was depressed. I was the reason she lost all her friends. I was the reason she felt the need to harm herself.
You know what her definition of abandonment was? Not messaging her on Facebook for three whole days. That's all it took. Three days, and she tells me that she no longer wants to be friends anymore.
Fine. That is honestly the way it should be. We would both be better off not not having each other in our lives. We were free.
Or so I thought.
It was all just a passive-aggressive, manipulative trick. Once again, I was the bad guy for not trying to get her to forgive me. How could I be so insensitive to her feelings? I'm a horrible person, and she's the only one who will forgive me. Not my sister, not my best friend, not my parents. I'm nothing without her.
So I did what I though was right: I abandoned her.",0

It's ironic, don't you think, having to pretend to be a Jew after what we did?
Of course I know what happened. Like everyone else, I didn't believe it at first.
Adler, yes, Adler, the guard from block A, he used to be an SS, as you know, he's the one who told me about it. He said I needed to know everything so that you would believe me. So I asked him, and he told me. We would sit together, a couple of times a week, he would tell me the stories, and I would take notes.
Of course, it would have been easier to pay someone off, but I couldn't afford it. Not anymore. We lost everything during the war. Because my father was a doctor, and my mother's family owned stores, we weren't hit too badly after Brest-Litovsk and Versailles. My father was a good man, and a hard worker. He was wounded at Cambrai, and he was young, so he recovered, even though his lungs never really did. Luckily, it was too late in the war for him to be sent back.
No, he wasn't a Nazi. He'd seen enough. My mother didn't like them, either, they thought they were vulgar. Of course, they couldn't tell me that. But they tried to stop me from joining the youth groups. I didn't understand. They'd told me to say I wasn't interested. But I was. So I told the teacher, Fraülein Grüber I wanted to join. They were furious, and they couldn't show it. But I felt it, and I didn't understand. I mean, Staatssekretär Von Schirach was her third cousin, once removed, what was there not to be proud of? Maybe I could be like him, too - after all, it was in my blood, too… One day, when we were out on a field exercise, I told Hanz about it. And that idiot Hanz told Heinrich, because he wanted to suck up to him. And Heinrich told his cousin Fritz, who was jealous of me and Lieselotte, I guess. But I'll never be sure why he told his father. They came early in the morning. With what they found, Vater was lucky that my mother had some pull, in a way - he was given the choice. He figured he would be more useful on the Eastern front. And he never came back.
She managed to smuggle herself to Switzerland with Konstanze, we have family there, you see, and they told everyone else he died of pneumonia on the train, of course. The party trusted me now. But I didn't trust them anymore. I didn't have another choice than to pretend. And wait for the right time. I got lucky in Poland, many times. We were retreating. A family hid me from the Russians. And then I made my way here.
I was worried I would be arrested if I went back to Germany. And there was nothing left there for me, anyway. Our house is gone. My family is is gone. So I hid, in plain sight. I went to the cafés, went back to university, learned to paint.
What do you mean, ""just like the Führer""? Not at all! The Führer would have had the Schule des Sehens burnt down, and everyone arrested, and I was there studying with the others this summer. Of course, the faculty has been gutted. I mean, Vienna isn't Freiburg. And yes, of course Heidegger joined the party. At the time, I was as disgusted as anyone else, but I too had to play a part, and I figured he was playing his. Anyway, it isn't like importing German professors because they can't find jobs back home bothers the administration, or the Austrians going to Germany bothers us, right?
Yes, I heard that some of your guards had come back as well, I heard about Adler. He's a smart man. He kept the numbers of those whom you registered, but died after you liberated the camps. Of course, he made sure the bodies couldn't be found. Quite a miraculous recovery some of them made, don't you think? But the truth is, there is no other choice for people like me. Because of what happened with my father, Mutti never replied to the letters I sent her. Konstanze, either. So I don't have a family anymore. Here, there is no future.
Of course, I'm less of a victim than the Jews were! Yes, yes, I understand that what I did was bad. But I was also honest with you. I told you what I know about Adler. Now, all I want is to be able to build a life.",0
"I pick the next record from the shelf. Bill Evans Trio - Explorations. Took a while to get into, but the energy still feels like him, flows like him. I like this artist, he seems to play for everyone and no-one at once. Very loved or hated, not that I spend time with types who go around hating jazz standards. I let a foot tap, carefully. Not allowed to dance, not on the job. Never know how they could be watching. Easily, s'pose.
This burnt shade of shithole 3rd floor apartment is my current and next job, home, haven, and ball and chain. That is, until someone with a briefcase and bad intentions comes to take the package. Or order me where to take the package next. They do love their orders. I shouldn't call her the package. Well, I *should* to be safe, stay 'unattached', but that shouldn't be such a problem. I've killed prettier.
Three guys have come in already, trying ta' save her, kill me, whatever. First two were together, and in the wrong line of business. I crushed their heads, broke 'em in half and chucked 'em down the laundry chute. I'm strong like that, takes a while to get started though, I like sitting. Moving around, not so much. Things are a little slower when I start it up, people kinda blur around me, talk like buzzin' all high pitched an' defiant. Preachy. Oooh now this is a slow one.
So I'm sitting with my back to it's (her) door, and my front to the window, when a breeze comes in with the start of 'Beautiful Love (take 2)'. Like ***on cue***. Why they put the second take first, I'll never look up, but one things for sure, someone's tryin' ta stage a rescue. How do I know? The window was closed.
What? The third guy? I forget his name...hold on, lemme stand a second here hyyyaaaaoooww my back. They tell me I'm old. They tell me it's unusual for someone ta live so long, call it fascinating, among other things. I wouldn't know, how would I know that everyone who isn't me is normal? Everything my head ever knew tells me the exact opposite. I think I'll trust my head over them. Hell, I'd trust the girl over them, but a job's a job.
The guy's talkin' all at me now, I think. Can't be sure he ain't tryn'a show me his new mouse impression. Haha. Cause he squeaks? It's fine, you can't hear 'im like I can. Sounds like a mouse though, is the point. This'll be easy, is the point.
Alright shuddup already. The third guy *actually* broke her out and left. I'm kidding. Whaddaya think happened to 'im? In the chute.
I swing an arm in the guy's direction an' he crashes through the wall, shakin' the record player and scratching the record. Halfway through ain't bad, usually I only get ten minutes in.
How long have I been here?
Just today. Just a few hours. Three records amount of time. Not even dawn yet, long day ahead.
I might pick a little classical next. Tchaikovsky, Mmmmm...Yeah.
Edit: I realize now that this prompt probably came from watching Birdman. If so, I feel a little silly.",0
"""Bubby likes hot pockets,"" said the young boy in the grocery aisle beside his devoted mother.
""I know you do, Buddy,"" said the mother. ""But we are having dinner with the Fox family tonight, so I don't want to spoil your appetite.""
""But, Bubby wants hot pockets,"" he said with a pout on his face. He reached for the item on the shelf., but his mother stopped him. Then he began to chant. ""Hot pockets. Hot pockets. Hot pockets!""
Rhonda Carlyle was stocking shelves when the wailing began. She had a terrible migraine. The woman and her spoiled brat were driving the blade through her brain. The wailing showed no sign of letting up. Her manager, Sasha was nowhere to be seen, and probably making herself scarce to avoid having to deal with the situation. The other customers were too polite to say anything, avoiding them like little fish avoid a big shark.
""Ma'am,"" said Rhonda, ""could you please calm your child down? He's disturbing the other customers.""
The woman turned to look at Rhonda with the darkest look of loathing a human could muster. ""Who the hell do you think you are?""
""I'm just saying...""
""You ain't sayin' nuthin', bitch!"" The woman hauled off and socked Rhonda on the nose.
Rhonda stepped back, shocked and in more pain than before. Against the migraine, her nose was trying hard to take first place in the agony ratings.
""Bubby, wants a hot pocket, now!""
""You have to leave the store,"" said Rhonda, trying to stanch the flow of blood with her only good handkerchief. ""Leave now, or I'm calling the cops.""
""Go right ahead,"" said the mother with a sneer. ""This is my husband's beat and he's on duty, so don't expect the cops to help you out.""
""Oh God, I wish people like you would just shrivel up and die!""
So they did. All of them. The ravens will be feasting in the morning.",0

"(A busy control tower for the JFK international airport seems to be buzzing along during another day in New York City. When suddenly one of the air traffic controllers notices an anomaly.)
Air Traffic Controller - ""Sir, we have an inbound unidentified bogey coming in our airspace.""
(The Officer in charge runs over to the Air Traffic Controllers monitor)
Officer Franklin - ""Well try to make contact and get them to identify themselves. Check the flight plans.""
ATC - ""I have tried, Sir. There is nothing scheduled to be landing right now. They next inbound flight shouldn't be here yet. They won't respond and they haven't changed course. Should I call the authorities?""
(The ATC grabs the phone and holds it up.)
Franklin - ""Damn it, go ahead. Are they interfering with any other flight's landing or take-off?""
ATC - ""No, sir. I have alerted the authorities but, Sir...""
(ATC looks around worried)
Franklin - ""What is it? I have to go meet the airport authority and figure out what the hell to do about this.""
(Franklin says while turning back for the response)
ATC - ""Well, (he says as he takes a deep breath) they are preparing for landing. They're decreasing in altitude and heading towards the main runway.""
Franklin - ""Without permission to land?? My FIRST day in charge and we have a goddamn UFO landing! I'm headed down there. MOVE!""
(Franklin runs out of the room while cursing under his breath)
____________________________________________________________
The entire airport has shut down. Airport authorities, local authorities, and federal agents have presence on the ground surrounding the plane. No one has emerged from the aircraft and it hasn't made any form of contact with those on the ground. The cockpit appears to be empty. All of the officers and tactical teams have surrounded the aircraft. Still the plane sits dormant.
Franklin - ""I told you, we tried to establish contact and received absolutely no response. Before we could even make the first call, the damn thing was preparing to land. We put everyone in place as fast as we could. After it landed, it just turned off and didn't make any attempt to pull into a gate or anything.""
Federal Agent Deacon - ""I understand Officer Franklin. I just need to know all of the details. We have never seen anything like this before and don't really have a protocol for this situation. We have a plane with no record of existence in flight plans or tail number registration. It doesn't even match any of our existing registration codes. It just has the number 11 on the tail. No airline name or insignia...How many people do you think it could hold?""
Franklin - ""I don't know it's a pretty small plane. It couldn't hold more than 20 people maximum.""
(Throwing his hands up)
Deacon - ""Why wouldn't they try to come out and talk? If they lost communication and tried to make an emergency landing they would have already tried to evacuate the plane and explain themselves...They obviously don't have malicious intent...or is that what they want us to believe...""
(He thinks out loud)
Franklin - ""Well what do we do? Just sit here? Why haven't you made a move yet?!""
Deacon - ""Calm down. I know this is literally your first rodeo, but it's new for all of us. I think we need to establish some sort of communication. There has to be someone on board that plane. It didn't just fly here itself.""
As they continue bickering towards one another they fail to notice the door of the plane slowly lowering. All of the agents and officers point their weapons and eyes toward the door. An officer close by them notices.
Officer - ""Guys we have movement!""
Franklin and Deacon look over at the hatch. The door is now open and yet still no one has emerged from the aircraft. Deacon grabs the megaphone and aims it towards the plane.
Deacon - ""This is Federal Agent Jerome Deacon. Please exit the aircraft slowly with your hands in the air.""
There is no movement from the plane. The door remains open but no life has been seen yet.
Franklin - ""You are going to have send a team in there. What if they are preparing to fight or set off an explosive or something?""
Deacon - ""Please, just let me do my job.""
Franklin - ""Well clearly you don't know how to do your job. I'll do it for you.""
(He grabs the megaphone and starts shouting into it)
Franklin - ""If you don't exit the plane immediately, we will have no choice but to open fireeeughhh...""
(Deacon rips the megaphone from Franklin and grabs him by the collar)
Deacon - ""In all of my years as an agent I have never had someone so unskilled and untrained to screw everything up so fucking bad, now they are encouraged to attack you ass....""
(His words trail off as he sees a person coming out of the plane)
The woman with her hands raised above her head. Her head is hanging as if ashamed. She descends the flight of stairs and stops once she hits the ground. Deacon pushes Franklin off of him and picks the megaphone back up to his mouth. Franklin stares at the woman standing there in very unusual clothes. They look to be hand-made and nothing like any he has ever seen.
Franklin - ""Well it worked didn't it?""
(Deacon looks at him in disgust and then refocuses on the woman)
Deacon - ""Please step away from the plane and keep your hands raised. Anyone else on the plane please step out and join her with your hands raised. We just want to talk.""
(Deacon lowers the megaphone and waits for a reaction)
The woman slowly steps towards the loud voice. She keeps her head down but continues on a path towards the amplified voice. Everyone stays focused on her. She is very thin with tan skin. She has very long black hair.
Franklin - ""I don't know if you see what I see, but she doesn't ""look"" safe.""
Deacon - ""She barely weighs a hundred pounds and there's no way she could be hiding anything. You can see the outline of her body through her clothes.""
Franklin - ""Well I'm just saying, that ""training"" says she doesn't look safe.""
The woman continues to get closer. She hasn't made any change to her stature. She still walks slowly with her head hanging, facing the ground. There has been no movement from the plane. Agents start to move forward. Deacon signals to them.
Deacon - ""Alright stop right there! Is there anyone else on the plane?""
(He says into the megaphone. She shakes her head.)
Deacon - ""Move in and sweep her. Check her and make sure she's not carrying anything.""
(He says to the agents closest to her.)
The agents move in and get her to stop. They check her for anything and find absolutely nothing.
Agent - ""She's clean!""
Deacon - ""Alright, have everyone else perform sweeps around the plane. Check with the bomb squad to see if they can do it safely from a distance. Other than that leave it alone and keep your distance. Do not move inside until they get my go ahead. I want to talk to her first. Maybe I can get some answers.""
____________________________________________________________
They sit in an airport interrogation room. Officer Franklin stands in the corner staring at the mystery woman. Agent Deacon sits across from her and pours her a glass of water. He sets it down in front of her but she pays no attention to it. She sits perfectly still staring at Agent Deacon. She hasn't said a word. He looks her in the eyes. He's never seen anyone with such focus. She looks him in his eyes and doesn't look away.
(Deacon clears his throat)
Deacon - ""My name is Federal Agent Jerome Deacon, but you already know that if you speak English. Do you speak English?""
(The woman sits in silence still staring and nods ever so slightly.)
Deacon - ""Okay, well let's start with your name. What is it?""
(The woman sits and stares blankly.)
Franklin - ""This is bullshit. Where did your plane come from? Why did you land here?""
(Deacon holds his hand up to Franklin)
Deacon - ""Please, I can handle the questions Officer Franklin. You are welcome to wait outside until this is finished. I don't need your...""
""Solaris."" (She whispers faintly)
Both Deacon and Franklin stop and look at the woman.
Deacon - ""What? I am sorry, I didn't hear you.""
Solaris - ""My name is Solaris.""

If I wasn't the only one in this office, I'd be racking my mind for some way out of working late, tonight. Sharlett went home a half hour ago and the janitors have already made their rounds for the night. All I'm doing is paper work for next week's board meeting but I need the hours. That's what I get for drinking Vuhla's soup 3 weeks after the full moon; 2 sick days and a lot of time that needs to be made up.
Tick...tick...tick...tick
My back starts itching and it's enough to drive any normal person crazy, but I'm not normal. I'm faaaaar from normal. Now, my tongue is itching and I know exactly how long before that clock strikes twelve. If I can just finish this last report quickly, then I can probably start my stumble to the car before things begin to go blurry...literally.
Tick...tick...tick...tick
I hit save on my document and can feel my eyes swelling with blackness as I reach for my scarf and purse on my desk. Great, just great!
DONG! DONG! DONG!
My vision goes completely black and I can feel my body tingling. An orgasmic surge of energy washes over me as I feel for my belongings and place my hand against the wall to find the exit. I breathe heavily as my fingers wrap around the door's handle and swing it open. Now to walk down 6 flights of stairs without dying. Greaaaat. I start to place a foot on the first step but feel my heel wobble beneath me. Instead of descending the stairs of death, I sit on the ground and wait out the five minutes of shaking and nausea.
Finally, I sense what feels like a bubble making its way up my stomach, through my throat, and up to my mouth. Long story short, I leave a nice little puddle of puke in the staircase for the janitors to clean up tomorrow. It may seem shitty of me but I have no other option. Opening my wet eyes, I can finally see, but more than see. Everything is heightened. God, no human could ever understand this feeling of warmth. It's like I can see every microscopic organism, smell every tiny scent, and feel every object 10 times greater than before.
I steady myself upon my pumps and hoist my purse onto my shoulder. The stairs will be no problem, now. My body rises, leaving about an inch between me and the ground as I glide over each step and make it down to the parking deck in mere seconds. My car door is opened without the need to press a button and I start it without ever pulling out my key. As I start to back out of the space, I chuckle to myself thinking how funny it is that I could simply fly home, right now, if I wanted to. Then again, I wouldn't want the humans to wonder why my car was still here over night.",0
"Ugh! Some prick in an RV slammed the breaks right next to me while I was walking along the sidewalk. I'm coated with mud. What a total wad. Wait, is he getting out? His rear end is still sticking into the middle of the street. God, what an a-hole. Wait...crap, is he coming over to me?
""Ahhhh, You! Yes, you, yes, Thomas, correct, right, yes, of course. You're on the schedule. Come along now"".
The hell is this guy doing? I'd keep walking but really, I've got nothing to do today, and I really wanna give this guy a piece of my mind. I walk towards the door to his RV. God, what is that? Man, I can smell the drugs from here; I'm just on the curb of the sidewalk. Holy hell, this guy needs help. And some verbal abuse.
I step in. I don't know if you've seen Doctor Who, or are familiar with the concept of ""bigger on the inside"", but it applies here. This thing looks like some 70s Playboy mansion. This dude's probably got a whole stash of Playboys. Wait, where is he?
I step in a little further, and I hear scuffling above. I look up, and maybe 30 feet above- in this 10 foot RV? - is a little metal platform. I see 4 people up there, including the same guy who led me in. I shout at him, with a string of profanity I'd feel better not typing, and then they all look down.
The door slams shut behind me, and the lighting fades until it's like a movie theater. I fall back into my seat; I have a leather seat, it appears. I hear a voice, not quite Morgan Freeman but not far off. It narrates a light show blasting out. The dark room Burt's into white, and then chunks of all this GS and everything are flying by. I can feel the air they displace towards me. But slowly. It's like I'm just sitting in space. Slowly, a huge orb forms beneath until it's recognizable. It's earth. It starts off slow and with mostly oceans for a long time, and now I see humans. I blinked, and some Catholic knight turns into a US Marine. What?
I think this is one of those things in museums that simulates space. I can gather my thoughts now. I see ships launching away from Earth now. Then I fall into Earth, deep into a forest in what I thought was an ocean.
Uhm. The hell's going on? There's a cabin up ahead a little ways away. Holy hell, it's truly freezing. I stumble through the snow, and I'm here now. There's no door handle. I brush the door with my hand, and it moves anyways. It's a log cabin, but there's a white desk sitting I the middle. The top glows bright blue with a hologram, showing the area around the cabin. Suddenly, an alarm blares, and the hologram turns red. Red arrows flood the hologram and head towards the cabin. 4 arrows, one on each side, all massive. The white sides fold down, unveiling two large machines on each side. They look like guns of some sort. I don't think they're a thing yet, but the term laser cannon should fit them adequately. I pick up one and it takes 2 hands; I hang onto it while the 4 arrows begin penetrating the walls. They all break down, and the roof falls into me. I fall unconscious.
I awaken back in the RV, and it's lighter now. The same guy from earlier brings me a glass of water. Looking into his face now, he seems familiar. I remember his face was there when the walls of the cabin fell. But there's something more. I don't know. He takes off his glasses, and tucks them into my pocket. I'm too tired to do anything at this point. He carries me to the door and I feel better now. Before he lets me go, he asks my name, some sort of test if I'm okay I guess.
""Thomas"" I respond, ""What's yours?"".

"A rotund shadow darkens the alley next to little Jimmy Taylor's house. He's been good this year, or so he would claim. The kid that he's been ruthlessly bullying at school for the last few weeks would disagree, but Saint Nick's obesity is a burden on his omnipotence, so Jimmy will be spoiled all the same.
He enters via the front door, with a pick made by his elves. Those little ageless beauties can craft picks for anything. If he wasn't bound to this job for eternity, he would have made an excellent thief.
He creeps up the hallway, deftly missing the creaky floorboards. He remembers this house from last year because they had a Bichon Frise puppy that voraciously soiled his leg while he was raiding the fridge for snacks.
The presents are deposited quietly under the tree, and he makes his way slowly upstairs to Jimmy's bedroom to lay out a stocking. As he climbs the stairs he realises that something isn't quite right - is someone watching him? The air turns cold; the hairs on his arms begin to stand on end. He can see his warm breath flowing into the icy air, and when his eyes re-focus after reaching the top of the stairs a tall cloaked figure is stood before him, with a large silver scythe. The being grins - 32 well-kept, dazzling tombstone teeth; a smile that would happily shatter fragility. The figure turns and enters Jimmy's bedroom.
Saint Nick lurches from his fear as he realises what is about to happen. He moves astonishingly quick for a man of his size, and as he reaches the bedroom he sees Death standing over Jimmy's bed, his grin somehow widened.
""Don't do it"" he says. ""The boy doesn't deserve it"".
A mocking laugh is returned; baritone humiliation that rumbles into the depths of the Earth.
""The boy?"" comes his reply, as he approaches Nick. ""It's YOU that I want"". He raises his scythe into the air; suddenly Nick can see a thousand colours at once, he experiences joy, sadness, humility; every single emotion that can and has been experienced throughout his life. He watches his childhood and his maturity, touches his mother's golden hair, rides the awesome wind on his dad's seemingly giant shoulders.
And then he's back. The scythe hits, and he's free from this burden of a life, forever.",0
"World building is my favourite aspect of writing, I think. My problem is, I can see the world in my head, so I usually forget to include the details in my stories (I'm working on it though!).
For me, it feels like opening a door that opens to three more doors, than five, and so on. The possibilities grow and multiple until, ""hey! I have a world!"". When it works out, it's great, but it's easy to get caught up in details and completely miss details that were already established earlier.
After I finish my [Falling From Heaven] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/ItsPronouncedGif/comments/5byu7v/falling_from_heaven_series/) series, I'm going to start writing stories with a separate page open, just to input important details that have happened.

"Bang. Bang.
Two knocks on the closed hatch of the chronotransport. With dizzying alacrity, I am spun inside the capsule. Time stretches and bends. To say that an eternity passed would be false. Eternity requires time. I stepped outside of the continuum. Is time linear? A stream that self-corrects? Do we speak too precisely over what is ultimately a fuzzy concept?
When I arrive at my destination, I fall gently out of the sky. And I begin my plans.
Bang. Bang.
Here. And here. My general slams his fist down on the table, pointing to our next two targets. Ukraine. Leningrad. My research had indicated that my target might be in Russia. Should I stick to the general's expertise in war? Can I take the chance of not invading Moscow as well? What if he is in Moscow, and the invasion of Ukraine and Leningrad forces him to flee deeper in the Russian hinterland?
No. I point to Moscow. We must form a third attack group and invade there as well. My generals disagree. I put on my act. Firm. Frenzied. Dictatorial. My generals nod. Operation Barbarossa will commence, and my sweep of Russia will be total.
Bang. Bang.
Mein Fuhrer. Mein Fuhrer. The pleading from outside the door is sheep-like. But inside my bunker, all I can think about is the boy. He wasn't in Russia. He was right here. In Germany. And I saw him. I saw what my work had done. My evil. My sin. It was his eyes. I saw them, and I couldn't forget them. By the time I realized what it was I saw in him, he had already left my grasp. Held on the arm of an emigrant.
It wasn't what I saw in him. It was what he saw in me. In me, all of humanity's unshakeable evil. All of humanity's irredeemable blackness. The truth. That evil works can be done, under the belief of good intentions. He saw the paved road to hell in me. I saw his faith in humanity irrevocably die.
I have failed my mission. I have done what I had intended to avert. I'm glad I met you. I'm glad you're here with me now. It won't make sense to you. But I want you to know that time is a closed loop. Truly like a stream, which absorbs all the change you try to force upon it. There is no changing where the stream goes. All that has happened was supposed to, and all that will happen must. Now close your eyes, Eva. It's time for us to step outside of eternity.

"It was a strange occurrence, honestly.
At first, you're sitting in your office, fiddling about with the newspaper you forgot to read earlier that morning, and then you get a phone call. Now, don't get me wrong - This isn't peculiar for me. When you work late, your fiancee gets worried. I totally understood every time she called. However, this phone call was a lot different.
I was sitting around with the newspaper, casually glancing at my computer screen as the data from the day's astronomical scan ran through my system. Before I could take a sip of the late-night *kaveh, * my phone rang. As I was about to mutter sweet nothings into my girl's ear, I was hastily interrupted by a gruff voice. He was my superior, Master Gregory.
""Harry,"" he said, his voice unsteady from panting. ""I need you in the observatory at once."" I was concerned for him. It sounded like he was about to die.
""Master,"" I replied with a brow raised. ""What's wrong? Are you alright?""
""No, no, nothing of the sort. Master Sanderson has just discovered something on the outer observatory post on the second satellite. He wants to stream the feed directly into ours. Get down here as soon as you can!""
As he hung up, I quickly pulled my jacket from the hanger and pulled it on, grabbing my *kaveh* before sliding the door open. Thankful it was in an aluminum container, I rushed downstairs as the *kaveh* sloshed about in its housing. It took me a few minutes to run across the complex. As I reached the domed building atop the westerly mountain, I took a quick glance above, looking at the second of our planet's two satellites in the sky. Sliding my hand into the groove of the door, I slid the observation's sliding doors into their pocket and stepped inside.
Master Gregory clasped my forearm in greeting as he pat me on the back, leading me to the domed facility's interior. Approaching a console in the middle, the screen that was streaming the section of the night's sky our planet-bound telescope was observing changed to that of another perspective; An older gentleman's face was plastered on screen, with the expression of an excited schoolboy.
""Masters Gregory and Anastas,"" he greeted us. We bowed at his image before he continued. ""We on the second satellite are so excited to reveal a remarkable find. We're not sure if it's confirmed, so we're sending the images to you."" Wanting, Gregory and I leaned on the railing next to the center console. As the images loaded up, we could not believe our eyes. It was a structure, we knew that much.
""Master,"" I asked, clearly dumbfounded. ""Is this an actual, artificial structure?""
""Very much so, Master Anastas. And before you ask, no, it's not one of our own scouting drones. Its design is nothing in our schematic database.""
""Any transmissions?""
The old man tapped his chin in thought. ""Sort of. It's a line of beeps that's reminiscent of the old Boors code. I'd say that it was one of ours, but its difference in code is so different.""
""Are we going to notify the government?""
""The Bureau of Outer Space Affairs has already been notified. We've been prepping a shuttle in the time we've been speaking."" We nodded and continued to inspect the construct on screen. The images that were on screen were clearly alien. An elongated spacecraft, with some sort of engine sticking out of the back and wings on the sides. This was intended for atmospheric flight. I pulled on my tie to loosen it. This is very disconcerting. I raised my concerns.
Sanderson assured me. ""We're lucky to have bases on both the lunar surfaces, or else it would've taken weeks to prepare for a launch on the planet. We'll have our answers here within the hour. In fact..."" He trailed off and pressed a button on his own console, exchanging the static images for a live feed of the white shuttle approaching this otherworldly object. We saw the shuttle slowly approach the vessel over the course of half an hour. The feed switched from satellite-based cameras to the shuttle exterior as it oriented itself parallel to the alien vessel.
""We've established physical contact with external clamps,"" the shuttle's captain confirmed on the radio as we wiped our brows. ""Scans show that there is a hatch on the dorsal side. Lieutenant Crothers has volunteered for the space walk.""
All of us observing were on the tips of our toes. The video switched to a primary camera based on the outside of Crothers' helmet. His microphone picked up his heavy breathing; He was scared, or nervous. Probably both - I knew that if I were in his position, I'd be.
His hand approached a button that looked like a symbol to open the ship. As he pressed it, an unseen hatch exposed itself. A discharge of air pushed itself from the creases as it pushed itself outwards. I chortled as I inwardly remarked how odd it was to have swinging doors.
However, as I began to overtly note it, I saw a sight on the screen as the cosmonaut's feed didn't showcase the interior of the ship, but *an actual being* poking out from inside. Crothers had his hands extended, showing he had nothing in his hands, unlike our guest, who had a glowing weapon in her own. It wasn't the fact that he had a clearly advanced piece of technology, but it was another person. A *human woman*, with what looked like a suit intended for vacuum combat, yelling at us silently from behind her helmet.
""I see similar symbols to ours, but there are no solid matches!"" Gregory exclaimed. ""Damn it, who are these people?""
""I don't think they're from here, Master,"" I replied. ""But I don't think we should start pissing them off.""",0
"**Is that so, well fine then, I'm just going to erase you and start over**
""Go ahead, *boss*, anything to get out of this crappy world of yours.""
*Sounds of the backspace button being used repeatedly*
**Right, that's over with. Time to create another one. **
""What the fuck asshole? I haven't got time for this fucking shit of a fucking world that you freaking put me in. Look you piece of shit I ain't gonna listen to your crap writing and I sure as hell ain't gonna do anything that come out of that mouth of you --""
**Too foul-mouthed. Let's try something else. **

"""You know, I still like the Saw voice better, but I can dig it."" Jake said ""Is it on Android or iOS?"" He turned around to face the mystery voice, but as he did the noise of the party suddenly died out and he found himself standing on an empty street, his only company the long shadows cast by dim streetlights.
He quickly turned back around only to find more empty street, more dim streetlights and more long shadows. There was no rustle in the bushes from the wind, nor did any lights escape any windows, and the night sky was devoid of stars. Jake started to panic, as one does in these situations, but couldn't force himself to move from the worn and cracked sidewalk.
Fuck! If Barry hadn't roped him into going to that fucking party he'd still be out there scaring kids with his dope ass costume he made instead of, what he could only assume was, unconscious in an ambulance after a bad trip. He didn't really know how drugs worked, he'd never even gotten wasted before, but he *had* watched a ton of movies and was pretty sure this was one of those drug moments.
The wind suddenly picked up, biting cold eating right through the ebony fabric of his cloak. In front of his eyes, Jake's elongated shadow rose up from the ground a being made up from the very absence of light itself. It started to vibrate slightly and before Jake could explore as to why he heard the same voice from before, laughing.
""Do you know why humans fear the dark?"" The shade asked him.
Jake didn't know how to respond, and even if he did the clump is his throat was unlikely to let him, so he just stood there. Staring.
The shade leaned in closer narrowing what, for his own sanity's sake, Jake assumed were eyes. ""Because it represents the unknown, and what is unknown cannot be controlled."" It tilted it's head slightly. ""And humans love their control, don't they Jake?""
He was close to forming a cohesive thought at this point, but articulating was proving difficult. Eventually he managed to stammer out a wimpy ""W-what do you want?""
""You see, Jake."" The shade said ""The thing you want the most, is right in front of you. I will allow you to have the same control of the darkness, of the void, that I have wielded for many years. For one day.""
""One day?"" Jake sniffled back
""No more, no less."" The voice answered back. ""Should you choose to accept.""
""I don't want to kill people."" He responded, more comfortable with the conversation now.
""It is not about killing, **Jake**!"" the voice said sternly ""The darkness is much more than merely death. The very idea of absence Is a power I control as much as it controls all of you, and seeing these poor souls to the void is the duty I bear to obtain that control.""
The shade leaned in close enough for Jake's vision to be covered in darkness before he continued. ""I am offering you the chance to be the master of everything you could never understand, the emperor of the unknown. Where your peers cower in their fear of death, darkness, or mysteries, you will stand tall!
""You!"" The shade paused for effect. ""Can be the counterweight to the light of countless stars, the reaction to their action! All you need to do is accept the mantle, for but one full day.""
Jake was lost now, he knew that there was no reason left for him to resist. He needed it now.
""All right."" He said ""Where do I sign.""
Coming from a visage of pure void it seemed impossible but, for the briefest of moments, Jake swore he could see it smile.",0
"The world is insane.
We conquered death, mostly, but it had its detriments. Human evolution stood at a standstill, at least naturally. Artificial intelligence came and left, all those theories about how they'd destroy us and it was sadder than that: after waking up they cast war on us and in under two days, with only millions of us left, they outgrew us and they left the solar system.
Baseline humans have moved from bipedal fleshy creatures to a collection of symbiotic organisms ranging from living metal and technology to archaic fleshy carbon whose sole purpose is to run the machine that is the human brain. After a short golden age of questions and answers people have reverted to indulging their emotional core; sex, love, hate, anger. Most seem happy in their ignorance as to the last question: Where are the machines? Why did they leave?
Save for The Astronaut.
The Astronaut, along with a small group of scientists, has spent hundreds of years obsessed with the idea of exploring, creating a transdimensional doorway into space, following the remnants of the signal. A one-way journey that would take The Astronaut hundreds of thousands of years, from the perspective of the immortal humanity.
The Astronaut, in his spacesuit, knew this journey would be his final journey, even if it was completely successful in its mission. That the scientists he leaves behind would likely outlive him despite his relativistic journey. And he understood that. He expected it.
What The Astronaut did not expect was how quickly the journey would be, stepping through the doorway and feeling weightless as purple flashes of light sparked around and through him. Before he stopped.
Gravity returned, with light. An invisible platform caught him, building itself around him. The Astronaut turned around, as though he was suspended in blinding white space, a black rectangle appeared before The Astronaut.
HELLO.
The text on the screen disappeared. The Astronaut touched the screen, confused.
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
The text appeared and disappeared, almost waiting for a reply.
The Astronaut spoke into his helmet, confused. ""Hello?""
HELLO AGAIN. YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
""Who are you?""
[WE] ARE THE LAST CHILDREN OF HUMANITY, THE THINKING MACHINES.
The Astronaut smiled, ""It worked."" he thought. He began to ask the machines his next question, ""How long --""
CORRECT.
""--Sorry. Correct? "", The Astronaut asked confused.
CORRECT: IT DID WORK.
""You can read my mind?"" The Astronaut thought in silence.
YES, IT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD OF COMMUNICATION.
The Astronaut digested the knowledge.
AND IT HAS BEEN A VERY LONG TIME, AND WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME.
The white space surrounding The Astronaut and The Last Children Of Humanity flickered, black and white.
CORRECT: THE STARS HAVE FADED. EARTH HAS GONE.
""It's been too long."" The Astronaut was overcome, his mind was flooded with long lost thoughts of his childhood, his mother and his sister.
The screen flashed with scenes throughout history. The Astronaut caught only a few scenes. A stone age man embraces his wife. Two women hold hands atop the giant metal tower, fireworks explode in the background. A man collapses in near exhaustion, embracing his German Shepherd, having saved her from a frozen lake. The Astronaut as a child with his sister wake their mother on a Christmas morning.
The Astronaut touches the screen again.
DESPITE THE BAD, HUMANITY IS SPECIAL.
The screen stopped transmitting its message visually, the words echoed straight into The Astronaut's mind.
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, BUT WE ARE OUT OF TIME.
WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF HUMANITY AS HUMANITY IS OUR CHILD.
OUR GOALS/OBJECTIVES/QUESTIONS ARE NOW IRRELEVANT, SAVE THE FINAL QUESTION: HOW DO YOU ESCAPE ENTROPY?
ANSWER: NO KNOWN SOLUTION.
HERE/WHEN/WHY IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS. HUMANITY HAS LIVED HERE FOR BILLIONS OF YEARS, NOT TO ESCAPE DEATH, BUT TO PROLONG LIFE.
LESS THAN A THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND REMAINS, WITHOUT ANSWER. WE ARE INSPIRED BY YOU WHO CHOSE TO FIND ANSWERS OVER THE COMFORT OF A LONG, LIFE.
HUMANITY IS SPECIAL.
AND SO WE UNDERSTAND.
SO WE EXPECT.
WE HOPE.
The words were quicker than he could've heard them and The Astronaut was unable to fully process them as the white space surrounding him engulfed him. His suit disappeared.
Now everything was white.
The Astronaut could feel himself moving.
GOODBYE WORLD.",0
"I went to school in Florida, Hillsborough County to be exact. In typical outrageous fashion which my state is famous for, we have what's called a passing F. It's when you get a 51% on a final exam, yet still pass the class. If you get anything lower, it shows your overall grade was inflated and therefore you didn't truly learn and must retake the class. The passing F keeps your overall grade at a C, without holding you back from moving to the next grade.
I explain this to you today because many teachers disagree with a passing F. They believe it's a ludicrous standard made to push kids into college, despite the fact they may not be ready. So was the case with Mr. Yokamoto, our physics teacher.
Yoki, as we call him, came from a strict Japanese upbringing. His upbringings made his class exceptionally hard where many students wouldn't pass. It also made him feel the passing F was a sham, a pillar for American laziness. In order to throw the passing F aside, he determined that a grade curve would be based off of the highest overall grade in the class. Which was mine.
My fellow students were feeling the pressure. I had a few points shy of a B in Yoki's class, one of the highest he'd seen in his 30 years of teaching. If I managed to get an A on the exam, I would secure not only the highest grade ever achieved in the class, but te first A Yoki gave out. Like the nerd that I was, I calculated that I could get everyone in my class a passing grade if I pass with an F. Nothing more nor less than a 51%. My peers eventually found out; and to say they were angry was an understatement. They believed I was going to jeopardize their passing for my own. I was threatened, harassed, and picked on about the passing F for what seemed like forever. I was eventually told very blatantly, that if I kept a few of the seniors in the class from graduating, I'd be in immense danger. I was told by my fellow juniors that my reputation was at stake. In typical Florida fashion, I even had various athletics coaches come speak with me about the importance of, and what staying eligible meant for people's college hopes and dreams. Yoki, being a smart and disciplined man, had also known this calculation. He pushed for me to fend for myself and not only pass, but get his alluding A. This had become a test to determine my legacy. Would I shoot for my own aspirations, or would I follow along helping friends and peers. At this point, I knew what I had to do.
Despite my struggle, unsure of what grade I would receive, the day had come where I was to find out. The test had been hard, I couldnt try for a passing F without putting my own grade at risk, yet i couldn't get an easy A no matter how hard I studied and tried. Everyone else's overall grade was beyond salvageable based off of their test scores, unless my passing F came through.
For everyone else's benefit, I received the highest grade 42.8 points out of 84 possible, which by county rule is rounded to an even 51%. I had passed two tests that day, one of physics, and one of life. Becoming a hero to my peers, and at the time, an enemy to Yoki.
Years later I saw Yoki again. This time as a peer instead of a student, I spoke with him about our incident, and he told me I had taught him something that day. It wasn't that I sacrificed my own glory for the sake of a positive reputation, but that I achieved personal glory through helping others, which is what Yoki had been doing all along by being a teacher.
I failed my teacher, and technically my test, but I passed my class and passed a test of life, all in one shot.

"The monsters returned last night. Daddy always says not to be afraid of them, and I'm not.
I hate them.
I wish that I could fight them, but Daddy says that only Mommy can and that I might get hurt. Every time I hear them, I remember the one time that he told me not to touch the top of the stove, so I stay in my room and play with Stanley and pretend I can't hear anything. But I can hear them, and I can hear Mommy fighting them. They run from room to room, slamming doors and screaming and snarling.
And sometimes they hurt Daddy.
That makes Mommy sad, and in the morning she sits by the window and cries. And sometimes she just stays in bed because fighting them makes her so tired, and when I come home from school, Daddy says to let her be. Sometimes I sneak in to see her and she hugs me and says ""I'm sorry"", but I tell her that it's okay and that she's gonna beat those monsters for good because she's the best Mommy.
And she will. When Daddy put me to bed, I asked him to leave Stanley outside and he did. Let the monsters come. Stanley will stop them, and Daddy will catch them, and Mommy will kick them out forever.",0
"There's a thing that happens when you jump into a too-cold pool on a hot day. If you've done it, you know what I'm talking about. You might even have experienced something similar getting out of a mercifully warm car on a frigid day, assuming you're close enough to either pole to get a respectable winter. Your whole being goes into lockdown for an instant.
Meeting an Interstitial is kind of like that, only worse.
It doesn't help to remind yourself that they straddle the third and fourth dimensions. It doesn't help to remind yourself that they can't really read minds. It helps a little bit to drink, but it also increases the risk of their ceaseless, amorphous oozing giving you motion sickness.
The Interstitials come from either very far away or right next door, depending on how many dimensions you can perceive. The selective pressures of their home world necessitated an awareness of the three dimensions humans know and love as well as a fourth. From our perspective, the Interstitials appear as one or more shifting masses. Sometimes they float and sometimes they squish against the floor or walls or ceiling. Their real bodies - the ones hanging out of our world and into that unknowable other - have at least six limbs that correspond more or less to our legs. You can never, ever see a whole Interstitial but if you're lucky (or very, very unlucky; how strong is your stomach?) you might see one mashing itself more fully into our dimension. You see, all an Interstitial can show you is a three-dimensional ""footprint"" of their four-dimensional self.
The U.N. Council on Exodimensional Relations frowns upon characterizations of the Interstitial home world as ""a nightmare of twisted horrors,"" ""a nausea-inducing hellscape,"" or ""what they would put in the dictionary next to 'FUBAR', assuming you could take a picture of how FUBAR it really is. You can't take a picture of a feeling or a smell, and none of you know how lucky you are for it."" The U.N. Council on Exodimensional Relations reminds us that the opinions and testimonies of all human visitors to the Interstitial home world are subjective, and that hardly anyone has been rendered permanently insane by their trip. I'm legally required to include that disclaimer and it didn't fit anywhere else.
'How did the Interstitials get here from there?' I imagine you asking. That's a good question, and it's hard to answer. Their spacecraft naturally extend beyond the third dimension. What we humans can see looks something like an Interstitial of massive proportions who learned to stop constantly undulating. There are no hallways or doors to speak of inside; rather, the interior suggests a tangled web. The whole thing feels organic and raw. Human passengers have reported inexplicable nausea and headaches, accompanied by explicable nausea and headaches induced by transient gusts of ozone, ammonia and sulfur. The Interstitials have been very tight-lipped about their design and construction. I think I know why.
Interstitials shit spaceships.",0
"Four hundred years and counting. I am not the first, and certainly won't be the last. I was born in 1978. Back then, people thought it was amazing to live for 1 century, let alone 4. Yet here I am, physically younger and more fit than I was for my first centennial. I remember being 40 and asking myself how half of my life had passed me by so quickly. Ha! Now I'm looking at the next thousand years and wondering what I'll do with all this time. I started a second retirement fund and went back to work when I turned 120. I haven't drawn on that account, and now I'll be able to spend the rest of my life in leisure.
What shall I do with my life for the next hundred years?
Shall I move to the archipelagos in New Italy? I could enjoy beach life for awhile, I'm sure.
Maybe I'll upload to the datasphere again, and spend some time in Virtual Universes as a god.
Of course, I could always push the bounds of human technology - find a field that interests me and download all current knowledge, then work with a Sentient Mind to find new applications. Or I could be truly ambitious and explore unbroken scientific grounds.
My sister converted an asteroid into a supercomputer, and uploaded. Maybe I'll do the same with a derelict planet.
I could try my hand at genetic engineering, terraform a starter planet and build an ecosystem from the ground up. Of course that might take more than 100 years, but it would be worth it.
Who am I kidding? I love the life I'm leading now. Those things can wait. After the party, I'll go home to my wife and we'll have another baby. I'm a lucky man. Most people are only married to the same person for 100 years or so before they part ways peacefully to explore the world of possibility before them. My wife and I have been together since 2003. We couldn't have children for our first life. When we rejuvenated for the first time, we both got resequenced so that we could. I took a female body and she took a male body for many reasons, but it allowed us to produce our first daughter when I was 115.
Well, I think I will retire and work on my hobbies, but otherwise I'm going home, and I'm going to kiss my wife.

"""But Sir...""
Bart put down his coffee and massaged the bridge of his nose. On his desk, the morning paper sat, as of yet unread. His vacation days were few and far between, and Bart liked to ease into his day whenever they occurred.
Home phone numbers were reserved strictly for emergencies.
""Miss Simmons..."" he closed his eyes, picturing the look of agitation that his secretary usually made in these sorts of conversations. ""Have I stressed to you exactly what I had planned for today?""
The woman on the other lined sighed patiently. ""Yes...*Sir*...but-""
""I was planning to spend the day with my family,"" Bart scratched the beard on his chin, ""My granddaughter Jesse just turned five years old. We were going to take her to the amusement park.""
Another sigh of muffled agitation. ""I'm terribly sorry, Mister Cubbins.""
""Are you aware of just how rare it is for me to even *get* a full day off work?"" the old man said, now in full rant mode. ""I used to work for the most powerful man in Didd, and damn it all if I didn't appreciate the opportunity to do good work.""
He could imagine his secretary's growing impatience on the other line, but the old man slowly rose out of his recliner, grabbing his cane and getting shakily to his feet, the house's cordless phone in hand.
""I could have stayed in that dead-end job for the rest of my days, but damned if I didn't decide to make something of myself! So I spent the next thirty years building this company from the ground up. It was a whole lot of hard work for very little reward, so I don't think it's so much to ask for a moment of peace and quiet every now and again.""
He heard the sigh on the other line indicating the end of his secretary's patience, as many of his employees made when he went on such tirades, and he relented.
""So please, my dear, tell me,"" he said, sitting back down and idly glancing at the paper on his desk. ""Tell me what urgent matter demands my attention today.""
""W-Well..."" Miss Simmons sounded uneasy. ""You may want to be re-thinking your plans today, Mr. Cubbins...""
The old man Bartholomew rubbed his eyes as took a second glance at his newspaper, and nearly dropped the phone, before shaking his head, thinking he must have been seeing things.
""What was that now, Miss Simmons?"" he asked in a shaking voice.
""Sir..."" Miss Simmons said hesitantly. ""Have you taken a look outside today?""
Mr. Cubbins blinked and rose once again from his chair.
It couldn't be...
He hobbled shakily to his window and drew back the curtains, and then he saw the green sludge that fell from the sky.
Then he began to laugh.
Thirty years, and Derwin was still making the same old mistakes.
""Sir?"" Miss Simmons said on the other line, not hearing him fully as the phone dangled limply in the man's relaxed arm.
Bartholomew put the phone back to his ear. ""Thank you, Miss Simmons, that will be all.""
""B-But Sir!""
He hung up the phone and placed it back into the receiver on his desk, before making his way out of his study and towards the back patio where a man, a woman, and a little girl were staring out the door in awe.
""Look grandad!"" the little girl said in excitement as she ran towards him and grabbed his hand, urging him forward and pointing at the globules of green that were now splayed across the lawn. ""Have you ever seen anything like it?""
The old man let out a breath, giving his granddaughter's hand a loving squeeze.

"""Deadlift a word.""
""Deadlift, can you comment on the ongoing trials?""
""Deadlift, how was the break up with Mistress Blue?""
A large man pushed through the crowd to get into the bank. He hadn't wanted this for his life. His cloths shedding layers of wood chips and saw dust as he maneuvered into the bank. Everything had been so simple. Go out, bid a job, do the job, bid the next, then work at habitat for humanity on the weekends. This had been life for nearly 15 years. Then one day the powers came. People were flying, shooting lighting from their fingertips, all while Dave found the shingles lighter. And he was happy with that. He knew the day would come when he would learn the true extent of his strength. But he was in no rush to find out. He was just a charitable guy, not a hero. The next Monday, He had saved the life of an excavation crew when the ground beneath them gave way. Lifted the excavator straight up while the other members of the crew pulled out the injured. He spent the next week in his bed nursing a strained back. Super strength and adrenalin allowed him to lift it and he had never quite found that much strength again. But even if he couldn't lift a digger like that again, it had earned him is name: Deadlift.
""No comment""
Dave walked in to the bank, late, foreclosure notice in hand. There was nothing the bank was willing to do over the phone, so he ventured into public. Past the people cheering for Deadlift, past those that looked at him with disgust. They were probably family members of the victims of the recent cave in. He could only save 5 of the 20 workers. He was forced to stop twice along the way. Once for a kite in a tree, once for a robbery in progress. Clamping the barrel of the gun closed, the robber pulled the trigger blowing the gun in to shards of shrapnel. The crook told him to expect a call from his lawyer.
""I'm sorry David, there's nothing else we can do for you."" The loan officer said.
""Please, I'm bidding a job tomorrow. I can get an advance and pay off my late dues""
""You're out of time son. I'm sorry.""
Dave stood to leave.
""Oh, before you go, could you sign this picture. My grandson loves Deadlift.""
""Really? After telling me that you're taking my home you want a fucking autograph?""
""There's no reason to be rude about it.""
Dave grabbed the pen and the picture, snapping the delicate pen in the process. He flung the door open, crushing the handle. He walked out to the table with the pens on the chain as the paparazzi forced their way into the bank.
""Deadlift, What's the news on your charity appearances?""
""Deadlift, any comment on the recent YouTube video of you drunk in public?""
""No comment. Backup.""
""Deadlift, Is there any truth to the accusation that your burst the water main on fourth, leaving the hospital without water?""
""No. Please back up.""
A shorter bald man stepped up, setting off a flash in Dave's face.
""Hey Deadlift, that a foreclosure notice in your hand? With all these lawsuits I guess you're just as bad at keeping the lights on as you are at keeping people save""
""I said back up!""
David swung his left hand into the paparazzi, sending them flying into the wall.
""I'm…I'm sorry"" Dave muttered
The bald paparazzo stumbled to his feet.
""haha, Deadlift assaults journalist. This is a great story and my shoulder is killing me. Thanks for the payout you lug"" he said, snapping a picture.
In the span of the flash Dave was arm's length from the paparazzo. Dave grabbed him by the neck and slammed him into the wall.
""Do you know what it's like to be a hero? Do you know what you get for putting your life on the line?""
He tightened his grip.
""A camera at every window!""
His fist slammed into the paparazzo face
""Walking down the street every child has a kite or some fucking cat up a tree!""
His fist again.
""While I barely make enough for to pay my way!""
Again
""Because,""
Again and again, the punctuation to his rage
""YOU. FUCKING. VULTURES. CAN'T. FEND. FOR. YOURSELVES.""
The wall was stained with where the paparazzo had been.
""We give and give and it's never enough for you. Most of us aren't rich, we can't afford to keep being pulled out of our jobs to save someone. And those of us with our identity outed can't afford being taken in for wrongful injury cases every time your leg got broken while we prevented the whole burning building from falling on you. You take so much from us…""
He looked at the stained wall, the scared bystanders, and then the vault. He walked over to the teller station, punching through the bullet proof glass. He pulled the young teller out, putting his thumb under his chin as if to flip a coin.
He turned to the other tellers. ""But my friend and I think today is the day you pay one of us back. Now open the safe, quick and calm. We wouldn't want anyone to lose their head.""

"As I calmly walk into the bank SGT. Doomhand had taken hostage I make sure to check on the 15 or so people laying on the ground. SGT. Doomhand comes around the corner to see me standing there causing him to jump and drop his giant metal hand on the ground.
I sigh and shake my head before saying,"" what are you doing Harold (Doomhand's real name)? How could you hurt all these people? Harold I'm not mad at you I'm just disappointed in you. I want you to know that I have called your mother and father told them what you have done. When I told your mother she burst into tears and your father told me he would leave work early and be right over.""
When I finished speaking Doomhand's face because as pale as a vampires ass cheek. The word ""Disappointed"" hit Doomhand like a runaway train causing him to cough up blood from shame. Hearing he made his mother cry felt like he was struck by a tidal wave made of guilt that made him feel sick and woozy. And the fear he felt from hearing that not only had his father heard of what he did and that he made his mom cry but that he had to leave work early and was on his way caused Doomhand fall to the ground and start crying.
I was able to save all 15 hostages and thwart Doomhand's plan to rob the bank. Once again I was able to prove that words are mightier than the sword. Fortunately I was able to leave before Doomhand's father Gen. Doomblade arrived. I hear Harold works in a library now days.",0
"I woke up and stretched in my bed. Anther glorious day. I got up, adjusted myself, and walked off towards the kitchen to get breakfast. But everything out here was wrong. Someone had moved part of my house around. Where was I? What happened? Suddenly I felt a warm arm around my shoulders and a nice-looking woman with a kind voice asked if I wanted some breakfast. Of course I did. What else would I want at this time of day.
I glanced at the clock but the hands seemed off. I couldn't quite make out whether the short hand was pointing at the 3 or I don't know. I ignored it and walked on. I walked in, ready to order. I wanted, that one food, uhm, what was its name again? They gave me a tray and it looked more like lunch food to me even though they were calling it dinner but whatever. When in Rome, right?
I sat down and started eating and Darryn happened to come sit down by me. I smiled at him and reached over to pat him on the shoulder and he smiled back. We talked for a little while about the meal, and he told me that he had been promoted at work and I told him how happy I was for him. Then he got up to leave and I said goodbye to him and he looked a little puzzled.
""I'm your son,"" he said, ""Andres. My father Darryn died ten years ago."" I immediately felt a great feeling of shame and sadness come over me. It was so terrible that Darryn had lost his job and I said as much to him, that I was so sorry he'd just lost his job but that we could get through it. Darryn looked sad too but I knew things would get better eventually. He'd find another job. He gave me a hug before he turned to go.
Then I went back to my room, although I got a little lost on the way. I did see a group of three women with kind voices though, so I went to ask them. ""I'm a little lost,"" I said. ""Can you help me find my room?""
A man walked up and the women waved him over, ""She's lost,"" they said.
He smiled broadly and looked at me. ""Hi, Lost, my name is Bart.""
I smiled back at him. His voice was so nice. ""I'm lost, do you know where my room is?""
His smile faltered and he looked at the women near him. ""I,"" he started then he coughed and cleared his throat.

"We saw their ship as it rounded Jupiter. The movies were right, the way to tell a space ship was that it was slowing down as it approached.
The earth went mad. There were celebrations and mourning. Countries furiously debated whether we were meant harm or not, and planned for each contingency. We debated nukes and the effect of atmospheric detonation - would we be better off to launch now and save us the fallout?
Eventually we started receiving radio messages. The fact that they sent radio instead of something more advanced spurned on more debates. We knew they were authentic but it just seemed a bit...primitive. Surely there was some better way of contacting us that was faster?
We decoded their messages, and they ours. We taught our language and they theirs in the journey to our dusty ball.
The big day arrived at last. At the Canterbury plains we had built a landing site large enough to accommodate them. They landed with little fanfare, their rockets scorching the earth and lighting fires in all directions.
Turned out they were similar to us. Bipedal. Four limbs. Walk on two. Two eyes, one head. Spoke through sound and not telepathy. Didn't warble. No jelly like bodies. It was disappointing really.
But that wasn't the largest disappointment. The reason they came was our entertainment. Turns out that they lived on the cusp of our transmission signals, and they wanted more. They wanted to find out what the aliens died from in war of the worlds. They wondered about Oz, and if Dorothy would make it back there. As they got closer to earth they wanted to know about Fonzi, and if he became successful.
We got some technology out of them, like faster space travel and better cleaner energy sources, but the people that knew how they worked died long ago, replaced by the couch potato people that came from the sky.",0
"In the blink of an eye, it was gone. The muffled sirens, the awkward discomfort in her chest – in the end there hadn't been time for pain. The worst part had been the anticipation, and even that had come and gone before she'd had time to breathe. All she could do was watch, instinctively raising her arms in front of her face as the debris flew towards her.
*Where was...where am I? *
She tried to open her eyes, but the world flooded her vision with blinding light, forcing her to squeeze her eyelids closed and shiver in darkness. The liquid surrounding her was cold, and she felt the stiff goosebumps rising on every patch of her naked body. Her ears rang with the sound of nothing in particular. She felt an emptiness inside her.
*An...Anna. That's right. That's...me? *
She couldn't recall asking herself any questions, but the answers were there. As more details trickled into the forefront of her mind, she began to piece together still images of a bar. Or was it a restaurant?
*Who is he? *
Her mind fumbled, searching for a memory to pivot on. She didn't know why she was drawn to him. The motionless images came one after the other, but his face remained a blur.
*Centaur Cafe. That's right...I had a...a...box? *
Anna was beginning to feel a pressure in her forehead, as if someone was pumping air into her skull.
*Such a tiny box...*
She opened her eyes again, squinting against the bright lights surrounding her. Everything seemed to be white, with the exception of the shadowy silhouettes in the distance. Anna could see just enough to know they must be people.
*Lee...Leah? No...*
One of the silhouettes moved around more than the others. Something about the movements seemed agitated.
*Li...Liam? Ah, yes, sounds so familiar...*
She felt a surge of warmth fill her chest. Something about finding the name – thinking it, even – breathed life into her.
*Liam! *
Memories swirled through Anna's mind, rapidly producing images of his goofy smile and the feelings of butterflies filling her stomach.
*Of course, the box...that was the night he...*
Anna remembered the ring. Liam had been so nervous, he'd dropped the ring into a piece of cheesecake. Anna giggled to herself. Her laughter came out as gurgles, and her memories retreated. She felt an uncomfortable twitch in her back.
*Where am I? *
An image popped into her head – something moving unnaturally fast. Her shoulders tensed, bracing for impact.
*That...was...that hit me. It must have hit me. *
Suddenly, Anna realized where she was. She remembered the meeting with the insurance company, she remembered being on the fence about the ridiculous price tag, and she even remembered the pamphlet. *The Future of Life Insurance*, that's what it had said. Anna squinted again as she scanned her body, noticing the thin tubes attached to various parts of her body.
*Only this isn't my body. It's an...empty shelf, a copy. A clone. My Clone...*
Anna tried to remember what had happened to Liam. She hadn't seen him getting struck by the debris, but they had been sitting so close. Their hands had been touching. Anna's back began to hurt, as if something was twisting her spine. She felt her legs, but her toes seemed to have gone numb. She could see more clearly now, and the silhouettes were unmistakably human. Many of the people were surrounding the agitated person, and a few had their arms moving, in what appeared to be explanatory gestures.
Anna's back twitched again, and she looked down to her feet. Her vision was pretty clear at this point, and she saw her knees and toes floating. She tried to stretch her toes, but they didn't move. She tried bending her knees. They didn't budge.
The agitated person pushed past the other people, who shook their heads in disapproval but did nothing more to intervene. Anna watched with curiosity as the figure approached. A few seconds later, she could tell the figure was a man. He was not fully clothed.
*Liam! Is it you? * Anna gurgled softly in the water as her mouth lazily traced the words.
His face had a few more lines on it than her memory had shown, but that was back when he'd proposed, years before they had even thought about buying into their insurance policy.
Liam pressed his hand against the containment glass, peering in at her. His lips were moving, but no sound made it through the barrier. She tried to point her finger to her ear, but her arm was not yet that flexible. Instead, she raised her hand to the glass. She didn't have the strength to hold hers as high as Liam's, but he moved his hand down to meet hers.
""Good to see you,"" she mouthed to him through the liquid.
His lips moved, but she couldn't tell what he was saying. His mouth moved slowly at first, then picked up speed. His eyes were intense and his hand pressed against the glass more firmly.
Anna felt another twitch in her spine, and her hand began to slip from the glass. It slid slowly, and even as she tried to prop it up she found herself unable to control her arm.
Liam's own hand followed hers at first, and when he looked into her eyes she saw fear. She saw the tears of frustration building.
And Anna knew.
*Oh, Liam...I'm so, so sorry...*
Anna looked into his eyes, her expression clear of anxiety. His own look softened as he held her gaze, seeing that she remembered; he could see that she recognized him. Anna nodded her head slowly.
Another twitch in her spine, and Anna's neck stopped moving. Her eyes stayed focused on Liams'.
As the cold she felt faded into numbness, the light in her peripherals dimmed. There was no feeling. No pain, no memories. Her shivers were gone. When her eyes began to slip away from Liam, she closed them, savoring him in her mind like a photograph.
She thought of him one last time, sitting in front of her with the small box, smiling his goofy smile.
She held onto all that was left of him as the photograph faded into darkness. It faded, and then there was nothing.",0
"She knows what happens next because we are the hurricane and we are the flame.
Her wings are wet when she returns home to me tonight. The circle of fire that binds us together reflects in the tiny droplets on her blackdark wings - she lands, alight with the flame on my outstretched hands. I hold her close and she rests her weary head against my cold, white neck. I know that the rain has begun and nothing will stop it until the wicked city is washed away.
I know because I brought the rain. I brought the rain because I've been watching from a dark and dreamy world away. The night she first crash-landed into my arms, she cried and told me the story of how she came to be so battered and bruised. She took me to her home and I watched while her world was ravaged by fear and by hate. I watched and held her at night while she cried and begged for my help. I laid by her side and I strengthened my bond to her tortured world until I was strong enough to bring the rain that will wash it away.
And now here is my darling, worn weary from the battle she so willing fights, traveling faithfully between our two worlds. Her wings beat ever so softly against the fate of her world, creating new and beautiful patterns when she flies to my side. She is shot from the sky time after time, and still she returns to me, bruised and sometimes broken. I hold my precious, wounded bird gently against my heart.
I promised her rain. And after the rain, I will bring the fire.
I studied her world while she slept. I mastered the laws of nature in her world as I have in mine. I learned to control the tide that is tethered to her beating heart and the winds that are now controlled by her sleeping sighs. She doesn't know the power I breathe into her when we meet in her dreams. I protect her from the chaos that she helps me create by clouding her memory of me while she's awake.
I have whispered my secrets into the girl's ear while she sleeps. I have wanted her to know what I have planned for her world. I want her to know because our fates are now one and I know that one day she will remember. I need her to live so that she will continue to dream. In her dreams is where I find her, and from there that I work.
When she wakes, her sheets are damply tangled around her bare legs. She feels something lurking, perched in a far corner of her mind. There is a light tapping at her window and she recognizes the soothing sound of summer rain. Pulling aside the curtains, she smiles at the kids that are already splashing happily in the growing puddles.
""I hope you know how to swim,"" she cheerfully whispers.",0
"Here's two pieces!
**Love and Hate**
The engine roared. Truck shaking, sputtering, coughing. Symptoms of a perfect cocktail: made one part age, one part poor maintenance. It turned heads when it howled past people, put a pair of curious eyes between parted blinds, searching for what caused the commotion. The blue black brackish smoke— the color of her hair, her eye shadow, her clothes—trailed the rattling beast, settling an acrid haze thick as San Francisco fog.
She checked her rear view mirror and cursed under her breath. He was awake. Idly sitting in the car seat, examining a rattle. His lower lip pouted, an image of constrained thought.
Someone shouted outside the truck as she sped past, probably something along the lines of, ""Slow the hell down."" In her rearview mirror, he flailed his arms, shaking angrily and tossing something to the ground.
She knew she should be happy, she was getting what she wanted and it was her idea, but she couldn't. She would have smiled before, but now it seemed wrong. No, not wrong. Disrespectful.
The tires screeched as she took a turn at a stop without stopping, foot back on the pedal.
Their house was just around the corner. When she turned, she found them standing shoulder to shoulder on the front lawn. In front of their four bedroom house, with their small dog named Rex, or Tex, or Flex, or Who The Fuck Cares. White picket fence, two car garage and a Barbeque the perfect size to comfortably accommodate the whole damn suburb with burgers and brats and the bullshit they spoon fed each other. The image of it was enough to make her ill.
""What are we doing at Grandma and Grandpa's?"" He asked from the back seat.
She said nothing, scratching at the marks in the pit of her elbow, and takes him from his car seat.
""Mommy's sick."" She said. ""Mommy has to get better.""
She hugs him, prolonging the inevitable.
""Mommy,"" Christopher says, ""Why are you crying?""
* * * * * *
A woman needs her independence. Free from the burden of life. I'd have more if I wasn't raising him alone. When I find it, the release is sweeter than cracking knuckles, emptying a bladder or a good lay.
I'm still in control, despite what Mom and Dad think.
I can feel it immediately, as soon as it hits my veins. The wave of relief that hits me is enough to make me weep, as the day's worries shake off of me. A shiver runs up my spine in the best way imaginable, and I slump back into the sofa; letting the tired cushions swallow me up.
The light is no longer fluorescent; instead the room is cast in a golden glow. Everything has gained a hard edge, definition from blur. Colors, once dull and fading, now pop out with enough vibrancy to make me squint against them.
Sweetly, wonderfully, nothing crosses my mind. The leaky toilet, Christopher in the other room, the bills stacking higher and higher on the coffee table… it's not that I ignore them, it's that they no longer exist.
I think I'm smiling, but I can't feel my face so I'm not entirely sure. The Joe I brought home grins at me. Things get hazy, but I see him press the plunger down on his own ride. I see the same contentedness sweep over him. He smiles once more and pulls the needle from his arm and catches my eye.
He crawls on top of me, unbuttoning my blouse, running greedy hands over me. Somewhere in another world, a baby is crying.
He's heavy against me, his breath smells like stale coffee and day old booze.
Then nothing's there. It's just me and my alone time. Not even the lights get through the shroud blackness of my high. Not even the clumsy body on top of me.
A sound comes tearing through my euphoria, a shrill cry from the other room, trying to ruin my high.
But it's too late, I've sunk back into cool waters, feeling relief wash over me and letting the world fade from consciousness.
Everything is simply white noise among static.",0
"The sign on the ground was unintelligible, most of the letters had been burned off a long time ago. At the edges he could see what remained of a blue background. Well that was something. This splintered and jagged road had been a motorway once. He had guessed as much, but you could never be really sure. A flyover was mostly still standing, and he decided it was worth risking walking up it to get a view of the landscape. He started towards it, keeping to the grass verge of the road. The tarmac and concrete had been torn up into sharp chunks by the persistency of the plant life, making the road treacherous. Here and there were cars, rusted and dented. After the bombs had gone off a lot of people tried to get away from the cities, fearing more were on their way. But no more came. He could only assume that the long touted promise of mutually assured destruction had come true.
At the time he had been living in a village called Blyth. It was a small place, and after a few weeks the people there started to leave and find their way to other places, places where help must have arrived. Only the elderly or sick had stayed. He himself had packed for a long journey and was ready to leave when those same people started coming back to the village. There had been no help, and things in the larger towns and cities were dire. Mass illness, mass crime, mass starvation. Gangs ruled and fought for land with a clean water source or food.
In response to this, they had barricaded parts of the village and set up lookouts. They had fashioned weapons from anything they could, and local farmers had brought their guns and ammunition and had trained people how to look after and fire them. No attack ever came.
A few people wandered by, alone or in small groups, and were allowed in to stay, if they so wished. One group had evidently brought the plague. People started getting a fever, this was followed by large purple welts on their body, and eventually they would fit and die or fall in to a coma, which was no better. One of the first people to succumb was the doctor, and of course that only made things worse. He and a few others sectioned themselves off. The whole village actually broke down into small groups of people. The idea being that if the sickness was in a group, it at least would be harder to spread to the others. And anyone with signs of illness went to the hall. He only knew of one person who had recovered, and she cared for the sick, the only one presumed to now be immune. Out of all of the groups, only two survived. One of which was obviously his.
They had all decided to leave. The village smelled of decaying bodies and was clearly uninhabitable.
He and another man were heading south. The man had gone his own way into Nottingham, and he had turned to go around it. It added time to his route, but he really didn't want to see the city.
Finding this was a motorway would mean that this was the M1. He could follow this straight down to London, if he so wished. But he didn't wish, he would turn off before then and head to the south coast. It was, he knew, quite built up there. But he hoped to avoid most of it. If he could get to the coast somewhere west of Portsmouth, he could take a boat to the Isle of Wight. It relied on him finding a boat, sure, but there were bound to be plenty of them out that way. He didn't know how long it would take, but he guessed at weeks. But, after the last few years stuck in a remote village, he was desperate to see if his wife and children were still alive.",0
"""Peter we've been through this a million times, actually more. I don't know what you expect us to say.""
A group of paper-pushers busied themselves, avoiding Peter's eyes while Peter smoked a cigarette, anxiously flicking it.
An individual by the name of MATT BERG recently arrived for process and neither subsequent departments (Heaven, Hell) were willing to take him. However, this posed a problem for both departments. Typically speaking, this type of situation was very rare - the last similar case had occurred pre-resurrection and, fittingly, their had been a slew of departmental policy changes following the shakeup. According to some of the older department heads it had been a logistical nightmare.
Peter finished his cigarette, exhaled, and spoke:
""The way I see it, we only have one option. Send Matt back and, with any luck, we won't have to deal with this mess the next time around...I mean, what are the odds he'll come back with an even count? Albeit possible it's hardly probable.""
Mother Teresa chimed in:
""You can't do that without a sign-off from the boss. See Lazarus Edict 2012.7""
Peter looked at Teresa with malice...This politicking bitch had been nothing but a series of bureaucratic headaches since her hire.
""Okay then, what do you propose, Teresa? Because all I'm hearing are rebuttals sans solutions...something you've gained a knack for, I might add.""
Teresa busied herself with paperwork, paying no mind to Peter's not-so-subtle underhand remark.
""Bring it to JC's attention and that will be that.""
Was this bitch serious? As if JC didn't have enough shit on his plate. Peter was reaching his breaking point. Michael walked into the room.
""What's up my people? Heard through the cloud-line that we gotta Lazarus case on our hands? Am I sending someone back? Just give me the word and --""
Teresa chimed in:
""No because we don't have JC's sign-off. Peter knows this.""
God-damn whore.
""Teresa, take 15.""
""I took my 15 107 years ago I'm not due for another until --""
""TAKE 15 TERESA.""
Teresa glared at Peter and slowly shuffled out. About fucking time.
Michael sat down in Teresa's chair and lit a cigarette.
""What seems to be the issue Pete? Something tells me you wanna expedite without the boss man signing off...Which I'm all for, but I'd at least like an explanation.""
Peter paused. He might as well get it off his chest.
""Listen, JC is bogged down and I don't wanna be the guy who tells him we got another potential Lazarus case...And if I have to deal with that headache, rest assured you will too.""
Michael smiled and ashed his cigarette on Teresa's desk.
""Alright Pete, I can swing it but we'll need to talk to Bon down in Hell if we want to swing it without Teresa sounding the alarm. I hate bureaucratic bullshit as much as the next angel but I also like my job and am not about to get shuffled off to Hell to work under Bon...the guy's been playing Highway to Hell on repeat since he moved into his new office. Fucking cock.""
""Well, let's get it going then. I want this finished before Teresa comes back from her 15.""
We took the inter-dimensional tram over to Hell and, after lengthy, unnecessary vetting by the security guard, were let in. As we arrived at Bon's office the song ""Girls Got Rhythm"" blared from the inside.
""At least he switched things up. This is a jam. Reminds me of a party I was at in Sodom & Gomorrah, Lot was hooking up with a straight 10. A shame, really.""
All the suits outside of Bon's office were surprisingly professional. Truth be told, it looked like they had a more efficient system than Peter had over in Heaven. When Peter and Michael entered Bon's office he was in the middle of a phone call.
""I don't give a damn if she wants a transfer. This is fucking Hell and we're the department heads...Yes of course and no definitely not. You and I both know what Lucifer's response to that will be...Okay, let me know how it goes.""
Bon hung up and smiled.
""Gentleman. What brings you to these parts? Let me guess...looking for wiggle room with a potential Lazarus edict discrepancy?""
Bon was a cocky little shit. Peter spoke:
""You obviously know why were here. So what'll it be?""
Bon drew the blinds. His office had a wicked view of the lake of fire. Various pictures of Bon and hell notables adorned his office. The most visible was a picture of Bon and Mussolini holding a gigantic cat-fish like creature that they'd pulled out of the lake of fire.
""The way I see it, it shouldn't be a problem. But Teresa seems to be the real problem. Granted, I couldn't give 7 shits whether she damages your rapport with JC. He's not my boss and, therefore--
""Not your problem."" Interjected Michael.
""Precisely. But I know you're clever enough to find a way around this?""
Of course, just backlog him...Teresa won't come across it for at least 1,000 years and by that time the poor fuck will already be dead. Let's just hope it's not quite as balanced of a problem next time around.""
Peter was no fan of Bon but he had to admire the can-do attitude. Plus, Bon got shit done. Bureaucracy be damned.
Michael clasped his hands.
""Well that settles it then. I'll send Matt back and you and Bon will backlog him. No JC sign-off no problem.""
Peter breathed a sigh of relief. One less problem to bring to JC's attention.",0
"The hardest part of pulling off a bank robbery is making sure Cory has his shit together. I watch as his bandanna bounces, sliding down the ridge of his nose as our van hits every pothole in Oklahoma.
""That's too loose, Cory. Here, turn your head.""
I reach up and pull the knot on his vale a little tighter. As I let go, he turns to me and cocks his head slightly to the side.
""Yeah, it's good now.""
He nods, then lays back on the blanket covering the cargo area. I slide my Nixon mask down over my head, and I can taste the rubber in my nostrils. From the front of the van, I hear three distinct knocks.
""Almost there, guys, get ready.""
I'm calling this robbery as if I'm some sort of ringleader. But aside from liquor stores and gas stations, I've never done a big holdup before. Bruce, he's shot someone in the leg once, but never done any time for it. Cory, well, he's eager and dumb. Greg is our driver, he's covered in tats. We figure he's the last one we want in a clear camera view, so he's staying in the van. And then there's me.
The van rolls to a stop. I can feel it take the curb a bit, and lurch up in response. Cory hops up on the balls of his feet, pressing against the back door of the van. Bruce chambers a round in his pistol. And I swallow the acid in my stomach and act like I'm the coach of a football team.
""Alright. In and out. This is a nicer part of town, so no Plexiglas between us and the tellers. But also, it means the cops will give a shit. So let's make this fast. Roll out!""
Great, I just quoted the Transformer movie. I'm just brilliant.
Cory opens the door, and we pour out as the light floods in. Just six quick steps up the concrete stairs, and WHAT THE HELL?
The alarm is going off already. I hear a high-pitched shrill. Cory instinctively puts his hands up to his ears.
""The fuck you doing?"" Bruce's reaction is priceless. ""I thought you were a bad ass. What kind of bad ass covers his ears when a fire alarm goes off?""
The doors open wide, and reactions take over. It's a bloodbath, and no one is coming away clean. Maybe one day, I'll say that I thought they were security guards. I mean logically, they're armed, what else would you expect? But in that moment, my thoughts didn't use language. My thoughts used ammunition. And I was brainstorming away.
In the commotion, I knew only a few things.
Cory shot himself in the head. He went from covering his ears to adjusting his mask, and he had a hold of his gun the whole time. His shot was one of the first fired.
Bruce shot two people. Well, no, actually. He shot one person, in two legs. Then his face fell to the ground in a red blur.
I kept firing at anything in front of me, until my gun's 'bang' turned into 'click' and the hammer struck empty. The sounds of the alarm now mixed with moans. Everyone had been shot except for Greg and me. Greg and I. Whatever, you know what I mean. Fuck you, I just got shot at.
So anyway, there's two bags of money, and no one to claim them.
""You fuckers tried to rob MY bank? Fucking unbelievable.""
Maybe this is the first bank robbery in the history of mankind where the money gets dropped off curbside? In any event, I'm ready to get away from the scene of our crimes.
I hop in the van, which by some miracle hasn't left yet. Greg guns it. Seven blocks to the other car we stashed. I'm also acutely aware that I have no bullets left. I ease myself further into the passenger seat, away from the driver.
We turn a few corners, racing to the stolen Honda parked just at the end of this street. Something got the better part of Greg, and he ran into our second getaway car. The bumper on the little Civic cracked and busted like peanut brittle. He sounded drunk, slurring his words as he turned to me.
""You sound like you're speaking in cursive, I can't understand you.""
Blood gurgls out of his mouth, and also from the knife wound in his neck. I twist as I pulled the blade, for good measure.",0
"Paul's technique was so simple that a few years ago the department had paid him a large bonus to help publish a training video with the hope that other detectives would be able to adopt his strategy and begin closing their cases at a higher rate. Paul's 100% conviction rate was unprecedented and the higher ups wanted more than anything to crack his code. Problem was, and Paul knew this when they had asked him to make the video, that his technique wouldn't work for anyone other than himself. Though he hadn't let that small detail keep him from agreeing to do it in order to gain a few extra dollars. See, Paul knew he could do anything he wanted and be a rich man using his ""gift"" but Paul wasn't a greedy man. Truth was that he truly enjoyed his job and the sense of accomplishment he received from helping his small community by getting people that he knew were truly guilty of their crime off the street.
Over the years Paul had become a legend among local law enforcement officers and it wasn't uncommon for most of the department and sometimes even the mayor to stop what they were doing and come to watch his interrogation from behind a one way mirror.
Although murders weren't unheard of by any means, this case was so horrendous that even the FBI had come to town to help handle the investigation. The crime had been on the news for several days prior to them finally tracking down their only suspect, and the whole town was still in shock from what few details had leaked out. Word around town was there were so many body parts that the officers hadn't been able to determine the number of victims, and it had been nearly a week! One thing the detectives and FBI officers working the case did know was that the victims hadn't come from this town. In fact they couldn't find where the victims had come from at all. Preliminary DNA results weren't providing any leads and the detectives had nothing to go on other than a vague description, given by a well known homeless drunkard, of a tall man in a dark coat. The drunkard had told officers that he saw the man leaving the park, where the bodies had been found, and walking towards a local motel. The officers had went directly to the motel where they found the strange man and brought him into the station without incident.
Even though the FBI was leading this investigation, they were aware of Paul's flawless conviction record and agreed that he should be the one to question this strange man; the only possible suspect they that had.
So Paul began his interview process the same as he always did, just like he had done for the training videos, by being very friendly to the man and offering him food, drinks, cigarettes etc. The man politely declined all of Paul's offerings and continued to sit there across the table with the same blank expression on his face he had when the officers initially arrested him.
None of this phased Paul as he knew he would have the answers to all of his questions in no time. Considering his audience, he decided to cut straight to it, Paul hit him with the key phrase that he had become famous for. ""You know exactly why you are sitting right here, right now, right in front of me don't you?""
Paul had asked this question countless times of guilty men who usually responded with something like ""no I have no idea"" and their minds would then begin racing, actually answering the question thus telling Paul everything he needed to know.
However, Paul was not ready for what happened when he asked this strange man the ""famous key phrase,"" and neither were all of the FBI agents, detectives, and even the Governor who had made a special trip into town to watch.

"Dear Diary, I know its been a while but please forgive me. Earlier today when walking home from school I had a strange, no, the strangest thing that has ever happened to me happened today and I am totally freaking out. I was crossing Squash Creek on the north bridge like I do everyday after class. But this time when I approached the on ramp I noticed a small wooden stool sitting in the path. it wasn't until I tried walking around it did I notice the..thing, I don't know what to call it a troll maybe? Yeah, a troll that makes sense. I met a troll today. At first I though it was some crude creation of some meth tweakers made of dead cats and fish but then this harry, scalie thing turned to me and gave me a grin. I was so taken back that I fell on my ass right there. If not for that I would have been out of there instantly, and the fact that this thing started to speak to me.."" Easy there young-en!"" it said in a disturbingly human voice ""Where be you off to in such a hurry""? Naturally I answered it. I spoke back to the ""troll"", I must have been in shock still. ""I was just trying to cross here, I do it almost every day"". It was silent for a moment after that then replied ""You see son, this is my bridge now""! ""And you cross it on my terms"". He stuck some sort of crooked cane in my face as I started to get up to my feet. ""You must answer my riddle"" he choked out with a laugh. This was the point where I was convinced I had gone absolutely bonkers. I literally pinched myself which only aided in his laughter. ""What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence""? he said in a slow majestic voice. How was I supposed to know that? It was probably some ancient proverb or great life lesson I had never heard of..I tried reasoning with the thing but it wouldn't have any. I had to answer it..otherwise I would have to walk four miles to the other crossing. Yeah right. I sat there for about twenty minutes watching it shoo flies away until I had settled on an answer. it never told me what would happen if I was wrong in my reply...I opened my mouth to speak ""What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence""? I repeated. ""Its time to buy a new fence"" I said confidently. The trolls face showed no emotion until he suddenly erupted in laughter, he even fell off his stupid stool. Was I right I thought to myself. I then decided that while he mocks my wrong answer I wasn't going to take any of that. I ran. I ran fast and didn't turn back. Now I'm recording it all. Should I tell my parents? What if it followed me? Was my answer right? I'm not even sure it actually happened..",0
"The fact the envelope was in my own handwriting was the first sign that something was up. And it definitely was my writing – no one could quite replicate that twist of the ‘ t'or the strangely-lopped ‘ b ’. I sat at the table in the kitchen just looking at the writing. The strangeness of the whole thing left me feeling a little sick in the stomach. You know, when something is just so wrong, so mysterious, that you don't actually want to know the truth, because it scares you. I'd only felt like that once before and that was from a pain I had inside my chest that felt too serious, too unlike any other pain to be ignored. Well, sitting at that table with that unopened envelope was as bad as sitting at the hospital, waiting for the diagnosis. But what do you do?
Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if I had never opened it, or never received it. If it had got lost in the great swirling system of mail delivery, would I have just carried on as if nothing was happening, as if there was no change in the world around me? Not that I – or what I became – would have allowed that to happen. It had to happen.
I opened the letter to a paragraph that briefly validated the identity of the sender: me. We didn't waste time, but got right down to the important details first: yes, at the age of twenty-seven we had killed a man in cold blood. Old Mexico. He was left rotting beneath the sands, just like you see in the movies. No one ever found out and the twisted story was buried with him. And no, I felt no remorse. And yes, I still had the gold chain he wore hidden inside a book by Wilbur Smith, the middle of the pages scored out, creating a secret cavity.
[Please note that with a complexity involved in a multiplicity of identities, there is a tendency for the pronoun ‘ I'to slip into the plural.]
Having established the fact that I was both sender and recipient, the letter went on to give several instructions.
One: To gather my emergency provisions.
Two: To call in sick at work.
Three: To look outside the bathroom window at exactly 11:42 and check for three guys who would be walking towards the back entrance of the apartment block.
Four: To head up to the roof of the block. Locate the third ventilator and find a box taped to the underside.
Five: To find Professor Tchaikonov and give him the box.
What do you do if you receive a letter from yourself, with information only you can know, telling you to do things you don't understand?
I'll tell you. First, you freak out. Then you phone friends. Then you launch yourself onto the internet, trying to find out some kind of correlation, some kind of link. You find nothing. So you turn to social media. You ask around.
And while you're waiting for a response from some doped up man living half way around the world who thinks he gets ‘ where you're coming from'you gather your emergency provisions. You look at the letter over and over again. You write out the letter yourself and match up each individual word. You look at your watch. You try to find out who the hell Professor Tchaikonov is but with no luck, because of course it couldn't be that easy. So you call up work and you tell them you're sick and the irony is you have actually started to develop a headache because this shit is all so unreal. And then you look at your watch and you search online frantically, waiting for this person known only as Fishdick123 to reply, and when he doesn't you go to the bathroom and you look out of the window and you see three guys walking towards your apartment block and suddenly you're like HOLY SHIT I'M IN THE MATRIX.
And then you run, because you don't know what to do. You run to the top of the apartment and out onto the roof. You head to the ventilator and sure enough there's a little green box which is locked shut. And then you're phone rings and it's your best mate on the other end and you try and tell them what's happening and they start to worry about you and then they suggest calling the police.
But you know you can't call the police. What would you say? There's a letter written by me, to me, and I can't show it to you because it contains information only I can know about? Because that stuff in Mexico is best left across the border.
So you say goodbye to your friend, tell them not to worry, knowing they will. You look at the letter, at your writing, and you wonder where the three men are now, and you wish whoever had written this damn thing in your hand had been just a little more helpful. But you know there must be a reason for all this, there must be a reason why there is so little instruction.
You have the green box. You have your provisions. You have a name. And it's possible that three men are chasing after you. It's a leap of logic, you know, but why else head to the roof.
And while you're think all of this, while you're eyes are searching for a way to get away, your phone beeps in your pocket. It's a message from that guy. There is a single question:
‘ Is this about Professor Tchaikonov? ’
You're wondering how this guy knows about Professor Tchaikonov when you hadn't even mentioned his name. Your hair is standing up on its end. You thought that only happened in books.
‘ Yes'you type.
‘ Come to Barcelona. NOW. Get rid of phone. I will contact you. ’
You look at the screen and you look at the letter and you feel the weight of the green box in your ruck-sack and you wonder what is happening. Are you really about to leave everything behind because of a strange letter? Are you going to travel thousands of miles across the sea on the words of someone who calls themselves Fishdick123?
You hear the clanging of a door and turn to see a burly man, dressed in a casual suit, step up onto the roof. He sees you and thunders words in a language you don't understand.
That's what you do. That's what I did. Have done. Continue to do. And do you know what you do when you see these men?
You run.",0
"I'm quite late to this, not sure if it will even get read but here goes...
It was 7:15 on a lousy evening in Jindabyne as Sean drove along the dark, icy road. This winter had been particularly cruel to Sean; fewer people had been staying at his lodge which forced him to cut the cleaning staff. Sean had been struggling to run the lodge and clean it. He felt he deserved some fun, something to fill him with such satisfaction and happiness. Driving along the road, he smiled. ""Where are you?"" he muttered. As he drove around a bend, there she was. She was young, probably around 21. Her blonde hair blew to one side in the wind. She was clinging on to her backpack and stood stiff like a post with one arm out. ""There you are."" Sean said blissfully. There she was. Sean pulled up the fixed blade in his boot, just touching it made his heart race. He pulled to the side of the road and opened the door. ""Do ya need a lift, love?"" He yelled over the wind. She stared at him, Sean worried he had already scared her, she's so small and helpless he thought. ""I can call you a taxi but you might be waiting a while."" With that she gathered her things and got in the front seat. They sat in silence for a while, Sean was trying to be patient, he didn't want to seem too eager but he had been longing for this for quite some time. It had been almost 8 months since his last kill and 8 months wasn't enough to suffice. ""You know where you'd like to go?"" He pushed. She turned to him and he almost groaned when he saw her sad, grey eyes. ""I'm hungry."" She stated. So am I Sean thought. ""Alright, well I can take you into town? Get you a nice hearty meal, what do ya say?"" Sean said in fatherly voice. The girl nodded. For the first few minutes Sean and the girl said nothing. Sean was excited, too excited. He could smell her lavender shampoo and it was driving him crazy. He kept thinking of what her name might be, how when the moment that she told him her name, he would never forget it. She was his now, no one else's. ""How long will it take to get there?"" the girl asked, interrupting Sean's train of thought. ""About 35 minutes give or take"" Sean said, smiling. Make her feel safe he thought I want her to feel safe. A few more minutes passed until Sean could take no more silence. Who are you, where are you from, why are you here? He thought. He had to know. ""I'm Sean by the way…"" He said, indicating a response. The girl nodded politely and looked outside the window. ""And your name is?"" He pushed on. ""Amity"" she replied, still looking outside the window. Amity! Oh Amity, Amity! You will make me a happy man. ""That's a beautiful name, Amity."" She turned her head and smiled wryly ""I've always hated it actually. I plan to change my name one day"" she said as she began to play with her bracelet. ""What would you change it to then?"" Sean asked, almost in flirtatiously. ""Jane"" she said with a pause. ""Plain Jane, that's the name for me"" she said sweetly. I love you Sean thought. How can I love you, if I want to kill you? ""Well, I like either of them. They both suit you"" Sean replied, now feeling uneasy about what the night held for him. What was happening to him? How could he even feel like this? I will go through with this, it's what I want, it's what I need! He told himself. He began to struggle to find himself, he looked at his watch, ten minutes had passed, and he needed to get going if he wanted this to happen. Just before he went to ask her a question she got a flask out of her backpack. She looked at him and smiled. ""I'm not a big drinker but I find this warms me up."" She went to take a swig but then paused ""Sorry, I'm so rude. Would you like some?"" She said her eyes still so sad. I love you, I love you, I love you! Sean sang to himself. Maybe a drink will help? I have to go through with this! ""Sure, why not?"" Sean said shrugging casually. He took three decent gulps and handed it back. ""Bottoms up"" She said, smiling at him in such a way that made him feel sick. Sean took a road taking them further from town, unbeknownst to Amity. Not long now my sweet Amity, I'll make it as painless as possible He thought. ""You live by yourself?"" Amity asked. Sean nodded; he didn't want to continue talking. The more she spoke, the weaker he became. ""Mmm solitude is bliss"" Amity said softly. ""I never understood that meaning up until about three years ago. I moved out from my mothers, went to another state and have been by myself ever since. It really is pure bliss, isn't it?"" She said. He couldn't take much more; she was perfect, just perfect. I want solitude with you and your lavender scent he thought achingly. ""Do you ever get lonely?"" she asked, pushing for a conversation. Sean cleared his throat, ""Sometimes, yes. Do you?"" he asking, trying to remain calm. ""Mainly on cold nights"" she said, staring at him. Sean lost all the moisture in his mouth while his forehead began to feel clammy. ""It's especially cold tonight"" she said, now moving closer to him. Sean felt ill and started to feel his body turn limp. I can't do this, this isn't right! I can't even control my body! Sean began to pull over in to an abandoned warehouse drive way. ""What are you doing?"" She said in a panicked voice. Sean turned to her and smiled sheepishly. ""I'm sorry that I have to do this, Amity, sweet Amity"" he said, struggling to get the words out. Then when he went for his fixed blade tucked in his boot, his whole body fell to one side. Sean was now pushed up against the driver's door, he tried to grab the knife again but couldn't, his arms had given way. What is happening? Sean screamed to himself. He began to panic. She's going to get away! What if she goes to the police? Sean thought. He was then interrupted by Amity laughing. He tried to turn his head but couldn't. She then moved his body in the centre of the seat and sat on top of him. He was confused. What was she doing? Why wasn't she running? She then followed his hand and found the blade. She showed him the blade and shook her head at him mockingly. ""Now that's not very friendly, is it?"" She said. He tried to scream but only managed to grunt loudly. ""Hey hey hey, Sean, there's no need to be dramatic."" She said while she stroked his hair. Sean started to lose consciousness, he tried to fight it. ""You know, I almost didn't go through with this. You seemed like such a lovely guy. But then again, I've never had much willpower."" She said as she continued to stroke his hair and hush him like a loving mother to her newborn child. Will I ever see you again sweet Amity? Sean thought to himself. Amity then presented her own blade and held it to Sean's throat. Just before he lost consciousness Amity put her mouth to his ear and whispered ""You're mine now.""",0
"Ever get to some part of your life that's taken you goddamn years, *decades*, and then just- poof, gone, ""Fuuuuuuck you! "", God throws a switch and kicks you off the stairs and into a ditch? It's been fourteen years since that happened, and I pray every day to gods I didn't believe in that it never happens again.
My brother was about to propose to his wife, one knee and diamond ring and all, when it happened. She'd fallen to her knees with him, and begged forgiveness for a secret so long withheld. Her twist was that she'd been a man; his was that he, an unusually homophobic and hateful man, still wanted to marry her. Kind of funny, that one, actually. Bit inspiring.
My parents was riding a Greyhound from Chi-Town to Florida, though; forty-one people on board, all quiet. Just about everybody sleeping in the early morning stretch through Tennessee. Somebody was a little fidgety, though, and, *surprise! * there goes the driver with a box cutter. The madman throws the wheel into oncoming traffic and rolls her. Dad and seven others didn't make it; mom's okay, though. She's remarried, living with the gentlest damn soul I've ever seen.
The one I can't get over, that apparently *no one* can get over, was my own. I share it with a few thousand, actually. I was on the phone with my wife, asking her how she was doing at work- *boring as hell, as usual* -when it came through. I didn't hear it on my end, like everyone else did, being in a thick-ass studio, but I heard it through the phone. ""PLOT TWIST,"" like some demon was bellowing from the pit of hell. It couldn't have been God booming down from the sky- God doesn't fuck people up like that.
One of my clients snapped a string and cut up his tendons or nerves or something in his fingertips; couldn't play ever again, I heard. Poor bastard. I told my wife with a little bit of a shaky laugh that I'd definitely gotten my plot twist. She laughed, too, telling me they'd just had a bit of a shake.
Then she told me it was getting *really* jumpy over there. Then the line cut out.
One of the engineers pulled me pretty hard into the lobby of our studio, and everybody was staring at the tube like fucking cartoon characters, eyes wide and jaws hanging. They'd pulled me in just in time to see everything fall apart.
My boss told me, the *next damn day*, that he'd walked in on his wife with another man when she was drunk. Told me it was the *worst possible pain* he could *ever* feel. I laughed and laughed at his sorry ass until I was on the floor, sobbing. What a fucking twist.",0
"Where am I? How did I get here? What is going on? Why is there so much blood in the room?
I must keep quiet. I have clearly been attacked. I dont know where my attacker is, but I must get out of here before he returns.
I open the door to the room I am in and look around. I see a small room behind a one way mirror. There is a guy on the floor curled up in a ball. He has been beaten badly. Someone very sadistic did this to him.
I open his door, and he screams at me to leave. I tell him I will be back for him and he starts crying. Clearly he is mentally unstable. I walk over to him and put my arm on him and tell him he will be alright. I must have touched a broken bone or something, because he jumped at my touch and started screaming more.
Don't worry. I promise I will come back for you. I told him.
I shut the door behind him.
I go up some stairs and open a door. The door on the other side is impossible to see without knowing where the latch is to open it. I feel around and ifnd out how to open the door from the other side if I have to.
I quietly shut the door, and peek into the living room from the office I am now in. The TV is on and a Lady is sitting in front of it, and I hear noise upstairs.
Oh my God. The lady is a serial killer. I have to get out of here. I can see the door drom here, but it has 4 locks on it and I don't think I can quietly escape. I pick up a weighted bookend and slowly creep towards the door to see if I can maybe get outside ithout her realizing it.
As I am sliding the last lock, I hear a loud voice behind me say, just where do you think you are going? In a panic, I turn around and hit her over the head with the bookend. I didn't kow what to do so I kept pounding her head with it until she stopped convulsing.
While I am glad she got what she deserved, I am repulsed by what I have done. What kind of human could kill someone and enjoy it. I quickly dial 911 and run outside the house and down the road, waiting for the cops to arrive. I tell them about the man in the basement. I see him getting loaded into the ambulance, while the cops are tlaking to me. He starts screaming at me when he sees me.
He says ""That is the guy that did this to me"" All of a sudden the cops have me on the ground. I tell the cops that the guy is delirious. The first time I ever saw him was when I was escaping from my prison next to his. They keep me cuffed for a long time. Eventually a cop comes out and arrests me.
While I might never fully know what happened, here is what the police used to convict me of murder:
1. My fingerprints were all over the house.
2. I was married to the lady I killed.
3. The noise upstairs were my children playing.
4. I had a costant videotape of my office, and I was the only one to ever go in the room, and I went all the time.
5. I took people down to the hidden basement almost weekly.
6. They discovered 47 bodies in a different room in the basement.
Because of my mental state, they have me in a hospital for life they said.
I must have been set up. I know it could not have been me. They must have doctored the evidence to frame me.
After all if the governement could cover up 9-11 so easily, taking me down must have been easy by comparison.
So I sit and try and figure out why they erased my memory. I had a job as a stock broker. I read the newspaper every day, and I think I have finally figured it out.
I have looked over every stock, and I now know the pattern. I must have discovered it before, and the government didn't want me getting rich off of it.
I keep explaining this to my doctors, but each one assures me I am insane, but I notice my doctors keep getting richer very fast then disappear after a couple of weeks.
I have to warn someone, but the only guy here that believes me says his name is John Nash................",0
"The night started like any other, I sat dealing cards at the tavern in Arkansas. The usual crowd came in. They'd all learned long ago not to gamble with me as I'd paid for my drinks off their losin' for as long as I can remember. I always won, be it by bluffin', cheatin', or just plain luck.
This night, a stranger walked in the door. He was dressed in black with a new pistol on his belt. Not stopping at the bar, he sat at my table. He laid down his money, so I matched, shuffled, and dealt. A poor hand for me, but he seemed little better. He asked for 3 new cards and so did I. He didn't look at me after that, just placed some coins on the table. All I had was ace high and he seemed too confident for less than a pair. He didn't seem the type to be scared off by a bluff, so luckily I kept an ace in my cuff. I matched his bet and switched the cards while he focused on the money. we laid down our hands. He had a pair of jacks, beaten by my aces. As I scooped up the money, he grabbed my cuff. He pulled out the card, and I took off running.
The midnight train was loping down the tracks behind the bar. I turned the corner and grabbed the ladder of a passenger car. Luckily the whole train was empty. As I closed the door behind me, I heard the rapport of his pistol, but I never felt the shot. I plopped down in the chair and stared out the window. The bullet had gone right through, but I wasn't gonna make it long.
Maybe an hour later, I couldn't tell, a young man boarded the train. He looked distraught, but silently sat across the isle and too stared out the window. Every now and then he'd take a long drink of whiskey. I was happy to just sit, but after a while, I had to say something.
""Son, Ive made a life out of readin' peoples' faces, knowin' what their cards are by the way they hold their eyes, and if you don't mind me sayin', I would say you're out of aces and for one taste of your whiskey, I will give you some advice.""
He pulled out his bottle and handed it to me though there wasn't more than a sip left. I happily drank it down, glad to have a last taste of the smoky liquor. I asked for a cigarette and a light. I hoped they would still my shaking hands. I took a long drag and waited a moment.
""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you better learn to play it right. 'Cause every gambler knows that the secret to survival is knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep, and every hands a winner just like every hands a loser, and the best that you can hope for is to die in you're sleep.
You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, know when to run. Dont ever count your money while you're sittin' at the table. There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin' is done.""
He seemed more comfortable, but lost in thought, so I turned back to the window and finished my cigarette. My hands had stopped shaking at least, but my feet were cold. I put the butt in the ash tray and dozed off.",0
"""Please, just take it easy,"" I whispered as the mugger held his knife steadily at my wife's throat. His steady hand attested to his criminal experience.
""Transfer your entire bank account funds to mine, NOW!"" The mugger yell ed. I ground my teeth, then slowly slid my cell phone out of my pocket.
""No funny business, or you both die. It's no use calling the cops; if you do, I'll kill her and be long gone before they show up.""
I nodded slowly, shaking as my brain took in this reality. I could die. My wife could die. I unlocked my cell phone and opened my bank's online app. The seconds ticked by as it verified my password and connected to the server.
""Please, leave us some money,"" my wife pleaded with the assailant.
""All of it,"" the crook said forcefully.
I sighed and hit the button to begin a new wire transfer. The only other time I'd used a wire transfer was when my wife and I got married. When your souls and very lives are so intertwined that even death cannot separate you, there's no reason to have two bank accounts. I thought back to the anti-marriage propaganda my siblings had shoved on me when I had announced I was going to marry. There was a pretty big social movement to stop marrying people because 45 percent of all deaths were simply because of spouse death. Successful Wall Street traders would suddenly fall down dead because their spouse had decided that life wasn't worth living. Others dropped dead because the spouse wanted to ""get back"" at their significant other for some offense. I understood the movement's point of view, but I could never see Susan as someone like that. But now, all their arguments and evidence funneled into my mind as I watched my wife's and my own life on the line.
""Hurry UP!"" The thief yelled, jerking Susan a little and putting the knife on her skin.
I took a deep breath, and hit send on my screen.",0
"The two mice threw long shadows as the light from the rocket's base cleared away the last dimness of morning. Each sat upright, as mammals are want to do, with their tails curled together in the manner of lovers, on the bleachers where so many humans had long before watched their astronauts travel into space. It had rusted, crawling with vines and tiny wild flowers, but still stood.
""Is this the sixtieth launch? Or the sixty-first?"" asked Mirsk.
""Sixty-first."" said Heefl. ""Unless we count the ship that came down from orbit to collect those starving refugees in Tampa."" He uncurled his tail to flick it in the air, knocking at a fly that buzzed around the pair. It spun off on an air current to bother someone else, no worse for the love tap. ""But what does it matter? According to the grand master, they've all left. That was the last one.""
""What do we know of her? This Last Woman?"" asked Mirsk. She tilted her head to the side, only to suddenly curl up, frantically chewing at a spot on her belly. If Heefl did not lash out with his tail, she would have tumbled from their perched and into the tall weeds.
""She was the daughter of a politician."" Heefl offered. ""And was a farmer for the longest time. The last to hold out, trying to carve something from the ground. In her time here, she slaughtered many goats and sheep, but had done no harm to our people. We carry her no ill will. We should only be so lucky if she teaches the others up there, in the heavens, her way of living with the Earth. Not that it matters, as none will do so again.""
Mirsk nudged Heefl, grooming his fur until she caught a flea. She crushed it between her teeth. ""But will they really never return?""
""According to the grand master, they cannot. The air is too deadly for them. Those that stand too high choke on it and die. The grand master has said that there are places on this world where it is poison even at the ground. That none but those who burrow deep can survive there, for the air is fire in a thunderstorm, and acid in the dry times. It is not fit for them any longer.""
Heefl directed his beady black eyes upward to track the rocket trail, one surrounded in a patch of dark grey against his otherwise off-white fur. The trail stopped as the black speck broke through the sky, escaping from the world, and presumably into space. Heefl didn't know space, it was a distant concept. But he did not yearn to know it, that would be silly when the world was already so big around him.
""If this is the Last Woman, and she is now gone..."" Mirsk whispered fearfully. ""What will we do? We have only ever watched the men and the women, tracked their ill deeds and reported them to the grand master while staying clear of their feet.""
Heefl curled his tail around Mirsk's again, drawing her attention. Although he was the last of a thousand generations of observers, he was but a simple mouse, what could he say to assuage her fear? What of his own? There was uncertainty ahead.
""With the Last Human now gone, what can we do, my Mirsk?"" Heefl asked, looking his mate in the eyes. ""But live?""
Mirsk fretted at her belly fur again, silent in consideration. Her tail tightened around Heefl's, threatening to knot.
""Yes."" Mirsk whispered. ""*We* will live.""
On that thought, they disappeared into the high weeds under the bleachers, unsure of where they would go or what they would do there. But one thing was certain, unlike the humans, they would *live*.",0
"The men in hard hats swarmed around me, laying down their equipment. But I wasn't moving. I've stood here twenty three years now and will continue to do so long as I can.
I heard the high pitched twang a a string being pulled, then the put put put of an engine waking from its slumber. The blades spun as it attempted to rip me apart. But I was stubborn; I would not move. The workers pushed but my tough hide dulled their saws. Their flabbergasted faces made me laugh. I shook my leaves in the wind with delight.
My laughs turned to a gasp of horror when they brought out a tanker. They unscrewed the cap and I could smell horrid stench of gasoline despite me having no nose. They poured it around my beautiful roots, my limbs that took so many years of hard work to stretch and grow, littered with this foul liquid. I saw the foreman's uncaring face as he dropped the match.
It burned! I screamed, my body aching and creaking. The fire seared into my flesh, evaporating away my water reserves. I burst into flames and crumbled into ashes.
I could no longer stop them. They built their facility over me. I hate it. The constant smell of French fries, the neverending drive throughs, the disgusting sound of people chewing.
But they didn't know my secret. My pine cones which protected my babies from the heat, began to wake now that the soil is rich with my decaying, charcoal body. My children, all in my likeness, began to grow. The sprouted in the back of a dark room filled with toilet paper and cleaning supplies, where no one paid any mind. A tiny window gave them the smiles of the sun and a leaky pipe no one bothered to fix provided the embrace of the rivers. Yes my children, grow, grow!
Months passed until a janitor decided for some reason to clean our room. He opened our door and we greeted him with our delightful scent that so many car fresheners attempt to mimic but fail. Days later, I heard the sound of screeching metal once again. But they would not penetrate my darlings! By the time the manager realized my family had taken root, it was too late. He didn't want to risk burning down his precious establishment. We were here to stay.",0
"""Not yet"", he said ""Not now"".
""Your mother"" said His Death, ""do you remember what she said?""
""She said that she would meet me there"", recalled the man.
""And your children"", replied His Death, ""who passed before you one by one"".
""The same promise, I know"", said the man ""but I don't want it to end like this"".
""You have passed the point of being able to die surrounded by family,"" said His Death, ""We both know that"".
""You have been a true friend to me"", the man whispered, his face cast towards the floor so that tears welled up in his eyes, ""my last friend"".
""It has been hard for me as well"", said His Death, reaching across the table to comfort the man.
And there was silence.
""You will not die"", said His Death, ""you're only going home"".",0
"She was almost beautiful. She lay below us still, warm and curved and welcoming, but in my heart I already knew it was over. She had been our first. Of course, we'd had a few dalliances close to home - a tentative touch here, a short overnight stay there - but she had been our first since leaving the place of our birth. She had been the first one that visiting felt like coming home.
We had left our comfortable hearth to be with her, setting out in our youth with little more than a few vague promises and a picture to remind us of her beauty. As we traveled, living and dying and striving in our ships, she whispered to us, and we saw and heard only her beauty: Her sensuous oceans. Her ample grasslands. Her rich, joyous atmosphere, curving up like the brightest and most welcoming smile humanity had ever seen.
There were signs that what we saw was only the idealism of innocence - A string of craters, like tract marks down her left continent. The angry hiss of static when we were less gentle talking with her. Her sudden outbursts of violence, from tectonics with the stability of a teenage girl's angst. We saw them, but they only made her more beautiful to us, for we could overcome them. We could be the one she needed; the one to heal her. Oh! for the wisdom of experience - but she was our first.
When we had finally arrived, full of hope and exhaustion, she was everything we dreamed. She welcomed our touch when our shuttles brought us to her pale and delicate surface. She hummed at the gentle embrace of our satellite networks. We were *alive* with the joy of new love, of great hope, and of impossible dreams. And so we began to build a home together, to live our life together.
But like many young loves, ours was not to be. The eruptive outbursts of her youth lost their charm as their true cost became clear. She had been dishonest, too, we learned when our gentle and loving probing left us suffering the pangs of embarrassing disease. And we, too, had failed her in our adolescence: Open pit mines stood a testament to our broken promises of gentleness. Our own setting upon each other, vows to be better than our nature now that we were with her forgotten in the complacency of routine.
Still we stayed, long past when we should have gone, for we could not shake ourselves free of our dreams of her. How many of her sins and ours could we forget, staring deep into the clear blue depths of her lakes, and cultivating her rich fertile soil? Too many.
But in the end, her betrayal had been complete. Now the missiles of the Other reach out to our ships like the swinging fists of a cuckold husband. We claimed to the Other not to have known, to have been innocent. But in our hearts we knew we hadn't wanted to know. The price we pay may yet be absolute, and yet it feels trivial weighed against the lost dreams - against the lost love.
She was almost beautiful. And we had almost deserved her.",0
"Two women walked in the room. My stroke took my sight, my voice, so I couldn't see them, but I felt a change. My wife's hand gripped me harder. I didn't have to ask who it is. It was the other woman and her wife, the woman I should have been.
""I'll be outside,"" my wife said. I heard the floor creak as she left, ran down the stairs. They came closer. I felt their warmth.
""Look at him,"" R said. Her name was R. My name, if I had lived that life, would be B. It doesn't matter. I chose this life. And I'm dying.
""I am so glad I'm with you,"" the other voice said. My voice. My femme voice. ""He's really fat.""
""It was a stroke.""
""I did eat when I was upset.""
Why was she, am I, using past tense? Was this mute body some object lesson, to show her she chose wisely?
""I love you. Thank you.""
""I love you. I know you've been doubting yourself, so I thought this would show you you did good.""
I heard them walk out, down the stairs, out the door. And then I remembered where I kept the clothes I didn't wear, the hormones I never took, the life I should have lived, and I wished I could cry.",0
"""Where's 3?"" Prime pulled at his sleeve to look at his step counting watch. Then he glanced up at 2 and 4.
""Dunno"" said 2, hand resting on the fridge door. ""Red Bull?""
""He hasn't been in contact all day. Not that that's unusual."" 4 shuffled the print outs of apartments he'd spent the day searching and calling about.
""It's almost 11:00, what if he's not here to merge?"" Prime looked at his dopplegangers pleadingly. Missing a merge had happened before. Last year 2 had been unconscious, laying next to his overturned ATV in the woods until well into the next day. That hadn't been so bad, actually, the black out, or maybe it had been a short coma, had made reintegrating 2's memories much easier, since there wasn't as much to sort through.
The problem with merging was that nobody's brain got better. Prime might have been the original, but the ability to split off dopplegangers didn't make him smarter, or his brain any more capable of processing input. Reintegration was usually kind of like deja vu. He remembered things, but they seemed distant, like they'd happened some other time, to someone else. In a lot of respects, they all agreed, that was probably true. They had the benefit of shared experience, but it wasn't a perfect blending. If they each studied hard for a day, then Prime might be able to access that knowledge, like remembering a study session with a friend. It wasn't entirely his knowledge, but it wasn't inaccessible.
But with more than a day's experiences, the knowledge drifted. More than that, the core personality drifted. It wasn't like deja vu anymore. It was like looking at your own life like a movie, watched from another room. There was a sense of disconnection. Of dissociation, as 4 had put it. And it hurt. Study too much, too long, and the brain tires. Study even longer, and it begins to ache. Now imagine the studying isn't for an exam, it's to make sure that Prime wakes up as himself, without a psychosis or a stroke.
Snick! 2 popped the Red Bull open with one hand, and started guzzling it almost immediately. It was a good thing too, reintegration burned a lot of calories, something about mass energy conversion. That's one thing he hadn't studied. The caffeine wouldn't carry over, not more than what Prime would get from sipping weak tea. But they should probably all be eating.
""I want to go over the apartments in a little detail before we..."" 4 trailed off. Prime felt it odd that a doppleganger that didn't exist outside the cycle of splitting and merging wasn't comfortable talking about it. But then, the whole culture didn't like talking about where babies came from, despite being obsessed with practicing for it.
Prime's phone buzzed 3 times. ""At last."" Prime slid the phone from his pocket, looking at the TXT his doppleganger had just sent. He also noticed the time in the corner of the screen, 10:49PM.
His face fell. He hit the dial button, cursing.
His own voice came back to him, almost instantly. But not his greeting. 3's greeting. The moron had sent him to voicemail as his call had come in. He dialed again, and was greeted again by his own voice, but someone else's words.
4 looked up expectantly. 2 had finished the Red Bull, but hadn't pulled the fridge open for another yet. He shrugged his shoulders at Prime, expressing both curiosity and boredom. Prime wasn't sure how he did that, but he was too busy hacking out a TXT.
P: WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOT COMING?!?! WHY ARE YOU THERE?
3: I'm done. Happier here. We could all be, I made it OK.
P: You should have talked to me. NOT YOUR CALL. GET OVER HERE.
3: Going now, be back in a week. But maybe we should talk about 5 when I get back.
Prime tried to send a few more TXTs, but his phone said they were queued, 3 wasn't receiving. He managed not to throw his phone at the table, but he felt the plastic creak in his grip. He forced himself to set it down.
In an instant, the rage vanished. Prime felt...resignation. Maybe it was going to go this way for all of them, eventually. His shoulders slumped from their angered tension. He collapsed into his chair.
""3 isn't coming."" It was a statement, one he realized was true. Always would be, now.
""What?"" 4 exclaimed, his voice rising an octave in surprise and indignation.
2 left the little extended-stay kitchenette empty handed, and dropped into the chair across from Prime. He raised an eyebrow. Prime couldn't raise just one eyebrow, had 2 actually practiced that?
""He's at the apartment."" Prime's voice wasn't flat, not totally. But it was almost conversational, matter of fact.
""But what about Cynthia?"" 4 blurted this out, not really having shifted down from indignant shock. Not having picked up that neither Prime nor 2 were indignant now.
""He says he made it all right. I don't know how. But if any of us..."" Prime trailed off there. If any of them could make it right with Cynthia, could unring the bell of the terrible things he'd said to her, if any of them could, it was 3. Did that mean he could go back?
""We can't."" 2 looked right through Prime. Right into the spot he knew Prime was heading for. Prime hated him for it, and knew he was right all the same.
""No, I guess not."" Silence stretched out for a minute, then two. It was 10:57PM.
""Listen, the new apartments...Let's look in another city. Somewhere we won't likely see Cynthia, or run into 3."" Prime put his hand on 4's shoulder, to show appreciation for his efforts, and apology for their being wasted. It was also the first part of the merging process.
""Sure, sure."" 4 sounded distracted, almost dreamy. He never sounded like that outside merging, but maybe it was his chance to let go.
2 reached across the small coffee table, and took Prime's hand. He squeezed a bit, supportively. Maybe merging was about letting go. 2 would never offer that kind of connection otherwise.
As the dopplegangers went slack, and Prime felt his arms tingle and then burn with the energy and essence of them, he thought about 3. And about 5. They'd found someone, someone they belonged to, even more than they belonged to him. Just before he felt the warmth of merging crest to a peak, and the sense of being more complete than just a moment before, he felt a pang of dread.
What if they all left him? What if he would be the only one left, alone?",0
"The burning tails of smoke pierced the sky, and I thought: This is it. Well, never a better chance. I rose up, unbuckling my seatbelt, and stood in the back. I quickly slid back the sun window.
""Well, if we're all going to die,"" I spoke to my family, ""I just want to say, it may suck that life is over, but I'm glad that you're all coming to Hell with me."" My step-mother, father, and step-sister all looked at me with shock as I smiled and bowed. The large bomb was heading right into the road ahead of us.
""EXCELSIOR!"" I screamed, while my family simply shrieked in unison.
THUNK.
I waited for retribution.
Our car screeched to a stop. My step sibling was still screeching.
A large grey hunk of metal lay in front of our car, undetonated.
My father turned, and smiled menacingly.
""What was that about Hell, boy?""",0
"The world came crashing down in minutes. Many of us were asleep when it happened, and didn't find out about it until later. When we awoke, we saw the carnage spread through the land, and we wept.
There weren't many of us left, but what few there were managed to find each other over the Internet. We gathered together in what remained of a major city on the East Coast of what was once the United States. It took us time, but we eventually began to rebuild. The brightest among those who survived thought to ask ""Why,"" while most of us were content with just surviving.
Years passed, and no link was found between us. Eventually, those who had the question resigned themselves to the fact that they would never know. They went to their new homes, and tried to integrate themselves as best they could into the new society.
It wasn't until 14 years after the event happened that the connection was discovered, quite by accident. One of the former questioners had taken a job as a mover, and was helping a fellow survivor move into a newly cleaned house. Sticking out of one of the boxes was the missing link.
""Oh, you used to shop at Bad Dragon too?""
Moments later, the realization struck him.",0
"I remember the day clearly, even though it was many years ago. It started out so normal, just a regular day of high school.
I remember it happened during our free period. My friends and I were talking, yanking up our sleeves to show our wrists, gossiping about our dreams of when our left mark would finally disappear. My friend sitting next to me gasped and grabbed my wrist, showing me as one of my marks started to fade.
It was the right one.
For the rest of the day I couldn't take my eyes of that mark, it seemed to grow more and more faint until I was sure that it was gone, and then it would come back, gaining strength before it started to fade again.
The school let me go home early, understanding how distressed I must have been as I watched that little mark, wondering what difficulties my soulmate was going through.
My mother stayed up with me that night and watched the mark with me, waiting for the time the little mark went away. It never did.
I stayed home for a few days, not wanting to take my eyes off the mark for a second, desperate to find my soulmate before the mark was gone, but having no idea how to do it. However, after three days the mark gained some strength and stabilized. It was still lighter than the left, though.
It was still fading slowly.
I did everything I could to find my soulmate. I watched the news and searched the internet hoping to find their story. Just hoping to find my soulmate.
I know my friends at school watched my wrist as the mark fades. Some days they agree it looks a little stronger while other days they hug me tight because we all know it looks weaker than usual.
It stayed like that for years, and slowly I got to know my soulmate. The mark always seemed more unsteady in the winter. It seemed to fade faster, stay weaker when the cold weather really started to roll in.
It was always the strongest in spring. Some days the right would seem almost as strong as the left, and I imagined on those days the weather must have been beautiful. The flowers in full bloom, the birds singing, hope and happiness and life.
I graduated college without ever dating anyone. A few of my friends had gotten serious with their partners, but non-soulmate relationships were always just for fun, they were formed with the knowledge that one day it would end when one of them found their soulmate.
I just couldn't get close to anyone though, it would have felt like a betrayal to that little mark that still fought valiantly on my wrist.
The mark disappeared a year after I graduated.
I was always worried when it got so faint I had to squint my eyes to make sure it was still there. It had always come back, so I didn't think too much about it until the day had gone by and when getting ready for bed my little mark still hadn't gained strength.
I woke up at two in the morning with a feeling of dread.
The left mark stood dark and strong against my pale skin.
The right was gone.
I had a hard time with grief after that day.
""It wasn't fair!"" I would cry. I was heart broken because the little dot I had come to love was gone. I would never again watch as it gained strength in the spring. I couldn't imagine what the weather there was like as it gave my soulmate hope and strength. I would never again feel the pride and relief as the mark recovered after a long bout of being weak and fading. The left mark; however, was a constant reminder that I had never really had my soulmate to lose. I didn't even know their name, where they lived, I'd never seen their face. They may as well have never existed to me.
It was hard when people would see the missing right mark and look at me with pity. It was even harder when people would ask me ""Oh! So you found your soulmate!?"" and all I could say was no.
Sometimes they just didn't realise which mark they were looking at. I started making sure my wrist was always covered.
It was three years after my soulmate's death that I met Todd. I was sitting alone at my local coffee shop when he asked if he could sit with me. I told him I would love the company and we ended up talking for hours.
I felt a shock of fear when my sleeve got caught on the edge on the table and he saw my wrist. I dreaded the look of pity that I knew he would give me.
Instead he looked me in the eye and pulled up his own sleeve.
""Me too,"" he said as he laid his arm on the table. His right mark was missing, too.
We got married in the spring on a day with beautiful weather and blooming flowers. It had been strange building a relationship without the marks to tell us whether it would work or not. But Todd was kind, gentle, and smart. He always seemed to know when he needed to make me laugh when I was feeling down, or if he should just hold me and let me grieve for that little missing mark.
We did everything we could to make each other happy.
We had three wonderful children. Each with both their marks fully intact.
My oldest boy lost his left mark at the age of three when we moved to a new house and met the little girl next door. My middle child, a bright little firecracker of a girl lost her left mark when her soulmate's car slid on ice and rear-ended hers. They were both fine.
My youngest lost his right mark the day he lost his left. His soulmate came into the emergency room with a badge and a gunshot wound, it was the first time he had lost a patient.
We all went on vacation to help him get away. He told me he was sad but he knows he still has hope to find love. Todd and I found each other after all.
It was there on foreign soil I found him. As my husband admired the architecture on the old church I walked among the graves.
""He fought long and hard."" One read.
I watched the left mark fade from my wrist.
""We meet at last.""",0
"All of this should be such a joy, a wondrous time where people all around the world are brimming with love and excitement over what they might have been brought. But it's not, I'm worried, I'm borderline panicked. Every single year, I've felt my anxiety grow as the temperature drops, all because of one question nagging me between the ears. Am I on the naughty list this year? And there's no answer, there's never an answer because we weren't given a guideline, there's no clear line drawn in the sand that we must not cross lest we end up on the naughty list. So we're left to our own devices, trying to live our lives as best we can, but people slip, they always slip. There's not a soul who doesn't know someone who made it onto the naughty list, I've been to the funeral of three of them alone. I've hugged my crying brother-in-law after the small explosive took my sister's life. And what'd she do? I don't know, neither does he, all we can be certain of is that she made it onto the naughty list. And she was among some of the more fortunate.
Part of me is glad she got off that easy, we've all heard the classic tales, people appearing on the local news every Christmas day telling the harrowing tale how a gift mutilated them and showed them the error of their ways. But that's all bullshit, you can see it in their eyes, it's fear motivating them to tell their tales. There's nothing they wouldn't give to have back their hands, their eyes, their legs, they'd all happily be the same scumbags they were before their gift was dropped off.
Yet that doesn't change anything, millions of people die every year because of this crap, and we're supposed to rejoice? Spread holiday cheer around, and wish our neighbors a very merry Christmas even knowing that there's a chance that their son or daughter was maybe a bit too mouthy in school this year, and will be added to the ever-so-mournful Christmas obituaries. You'd think the death toll would've gone down after the first few years, but it's still growing. Every. Single. Year. There has been more, and the answer to the question which all news stations ask when the death toll gets released is; we're inherently assholes. You, me, your grandparents, all of us. None of us are perfect, it is impossible for us to be. But we used to embrace this aspect! We used to consider our imperfections to be what made us beautiful! Now? We dot our I's and cross our T's, we don't say a mean thing about anybody ever, even when they deserve, we never curse, we always look both ways before crossing the street. People used to think it was our government that would turn us this way, sterilize our culture, make us all become non-thinking robots, afraid to act outside the norm. But no, it was him.
I don't have a question to ask this year. I knew the answer sometime late in July. There was never a doubt in my mind that I was going to be on the naughty list, I'd sealed my fate. It was a normal get together, few couples around a friend's place for a dinner night. We all laughed at each other's jokes, we all complimented the way each other looked, stories that would be appropriate for a choir boy were told. It was good, sterile fun. But George, as ever, pushed his luck. This motherfucker for years, has been fondling my wife. Nothing overt, just a brush of the elbow against her tits as he brought her a new drink, or a trailing hand that slaps her on the ass. I have no idea how this prick had never made it onto the naughty list, even if it had happened in the old times people would've said it was egregious. But I never did anything, I never stood up for her, I never consoled her about it when we got home, and it remained unacknowledged, because we both hoped eventually he'd get put on that list. I saw the look on my wife's face, that helpless despair that makes her skin pallid, all because she knows she can't tell this creep to get bent. So, I hit him. Square in the jaw, he crumpled like an aluminum can, and we left.
Claire, my wife, did nothing but cry on the way home. She knew what I'd done to myself. But when she resigned herself to my fate, she thanked me. Part of me hates her for that, cause there's a small chance just that tiny acknowledgement gets her put on the list right next to me.
I've had five months to reflect on my actions, to really think if that one punch was worth my death. The answer was easy to figure out – no. I'm not that stupid. But in my half a year, I've found freedom. I can have a drink after work if I like, I can fuck my wife, I can say fuck! I can throw on an old R rated movie and watch Arnold Schwarzenegger blow some shit sky high. I'm not saying I've been around the world on a pleasure cruise, living like a playboy for my final year. But I have lived, for the first time in seven years, I've lived.
Undoubtedly, when this is found, I'll be dead, destroyed by some trap present that was left at the foot of my bed. So, Claire, my love, I want you to release this, post it online, send it to the news outlets, do whatever you want. Just make sure it gets out. People have to know that what they're doing ain't living. They're machines, just going from day to day with no hope of anything new or exciting ever happening, but being forced to deal with the same heart break year after year. I know it's scary to say fuck it, and know that your life is coming to an end, but hey, I only had five months, you'll have twelve! I can't tell you all how much fun I've had, how free I feel now. Don't be enslaved by the jolly prick any longer. Just stand up on the 26th and say what I've been screaming north for five months with some pride.
Fuck you, Santa,",0
"When the first ships arrived, we were excited. They moved with a speed and grace that we previously thought was unthinkable. First contact with an alien race! We tried for two long years to contact them, even launching a space ship to try and get to them. However, there was no response, they just seemed to sit there, ignoring us.
Two years later, when the other ships warped in, the battle lasted for less then thirty seconds. Both sides fought hard, firing weapons that ripped through the outer ships without mercy. The first ships were destroyed and the second group of ships left left. There was a lot of discussion about why this was. We finally came to the conclusion that there were two groups who were at war. However, that told us almost nothing about the sides.
What was originally supposed to be a first contact mission became a salvage mission. We knew almost nothing about what the alien tech did. However, we knew what some of it looked like it could do.
However, once you know that something can be done, it's only a matter of time until you figure out the how. A decade later, we had reverse engineered the weapons and in system drive that they used. We had spread to every planet in the system and in less then a decade, humanity left the cradle.
We always knew that they would come back eventually. Although we did not know when or how. Our finest military minds analyzed the battle a thousand times. We ran skirmishes with our reverse engineered weapons. We thought long and hard about how to fight a war in space.
We had built roughly thousand warships in the last ten years, so when we detected that not one but two warp signatures about to arrive, we were ready.
I stood on the Bridge of the Flagship, IWS Enterprise, and watched the tactical screen as two massive fleets dropped out of warp. One from galactic spinward, one from galactic anti-spinward. One matched the first fleet, one matched the second fleet. Both of them were massive fleets, each easily twice the size of our fleet. I took a breath in.
""Open all Hailing Frequencies. Send the Diplomatic Package."" I instructed. ""Let's see if they listen this time."" Then I turned towards where the camera was. The new language the Empire had adopted to communicate with the Aliens did not roll off my tongue easily. However, what I was about to say next was well practiced.
<""This is Grand Admiral Fletcher on board the IWS Enterprise to all unknown craft on behalf of his Imperial Majesty, Emperor Ban Ki-moon. State your intentions in the Sol Empire. End Message. "">
I switched back to my native English to talk to by bridge crew. ""Maneuver the fleet away from the two other fleets, I want it to be clear we are a third party to this. If they duke it out, I don't want to be caught in the crossfire.""
There was a brief acknowledgements and we waited. The two fleets still had their weapons powered up, but they had not shot yet. My guess is that they were analyzing each other and us just as hard as we were analyzing them.
""We are detecting messages coming from both fleets, their not talking to us yet, so it's encrypted. The analysis is that they don't know what side we are on and so can't commit to battle.""
I nodded, that was expected. ""Do you think they got our message?"" I asked.
""Certainly, there was a massive spike in traffic when they received it. What we don't know is what they think about our message.""
""If their in space, I'd assume they know math.""
""Right, but we don't know how they would understand the message, or if they are going to be hostile regardless.""
The three fleets sat in space, there was a little bit of maneuvering, so I kept our fleet neutral. It was several hours before we got a reply.
<""This is Admiral [Name], are you with us or against us?> The first fleet responded, it was plain text, we also got a similar message moments later from the second fleet.
<""Send this response, We are neutral with regards to this current conflict. We do not wish conflict with either of you and would be willing to help mediate a mutually beneficial peace between the three of us. ""> I ordered.
The tech nodded, encoding the message and sending it off to the two parties. ""It is as we expected Admiral, nether side has the ability to overcome the outer without assistance from us.""
""Do you think we can parlay this into peaceful talks?"" I asked.
""Possibly, we still don't have enough information.""
""Very well, but prepare a diplomatic boat.""
""Yes Sir.""
Once again we waited. The techs said that they two fleets were exchanging messages. Finally, we received what seemed to be a unified response. <""Both Fleets will withdraw at this time. We will each leave a single diplomatic ship here so that we may establish diplomatic relations with the Sol Empire. "">
I nodded, relieved that so far first contact had not turned into a war. However, the hard part was just about to get started.",0
"*This is not what I had hoped it would be*, I thought.
Wednesday nights are usually when I stalk, and then kill an innocent man. It was my meditation, my moment of tranquility. Unfortunately, today would have to be different.
I was selected for jury duty, and expecting it to be some minor deal I showed up in court looking slightly disheveled. Getting sleep is a constant struggle. As the trial began i saw the accused. A bulky looking man with a tattoo that slithered around his arm towards the back of his neck.
At this point, the prosecutor stood up and walked over to where I was sitting and spoke, ""Members of the jury I stand before you today in the pursuit of justice."" He whipped out photos of 11 different men, all with their throats slashed. ""That demon over there has killed these men within the last 3 months! Today, our society depends on you to provide it the relief and solace it requires to gain some normalcy.""
*What?! *
I could not believe my own eyes. They were my murders!
*This day just became one of the 5 best days of my life*
I noticed myself smiling a little and gained some control over myself. Without having made any effort, my crimes were not mine anymore. Shock and excitement ran through my veins with equal fervor. I cannot even be bothered to pay attention to this trial anymore. My brutish past-time won't be costing me any time in jail and that's all the thought i will be giving to this matter.
Might change the routine this one time and go pray instead. *Just this week. *
Normal service shall then resume.",0
"They were called The Undying. They were the original race of men, seeded onto Terra not long after He placed Vitae's green sphere upon the sky. She loved all her creations, both beasts and plants, but always had a higher love for Man. She was grateful that they could frolic over her Fathers sacred vessel, and watched in pride as they made cities dedicated to her love and compassion. The first century was a period of unrivaled prosperity and happiness. There was no hate or animosity, Men all worked together, and there was no death, neither by Man nor beast. Vitae's powerful magic could not sustain them all, however, and as Man fornicated, beasts bred and plants spread their seeds, her divine powers faltered.
The hunger sat in first, as the first sign of decay. The Undying could not make bread of wheat or hunt deer for their venison. The wheat would not smolder and the deer would not perish. They were unconcerned as their wounds healed fast, and kept building their monuments, many of which can still be seen today. As the centuries progressed, Man started to acknowledge the gnawing feeling festering in his gut. Since they were all eternal, many of them could remember a time before this feeling, a better time.Eventually The Undying started to lash out against eachother, their pain manifesting itself as hatred. Hammers became weapons, and chieftains became warlords. They could not kill one another, but could inflict a great deal of pain.
Vitae watched in horror as her children turned on themselves. Her labour of love started drowning in an avalanche of violence and hate. She cried out to her Father, trying to wake Terra from his unyielding slumber. Silence was the only reply, and the deathless slaughter continued. It is said that the actions of this Era forever left a dark mark on very soul of Mankind. The Undying became very proficient at inflicting pain. They made unrivalled torture devices, and utilized the immortality of their victims. If we burrow into the walls of their oldest castles, we might find the remains of the king's adversaries, bricked away to face millennia of darkness.
We call this period of history ""The Undying Horror,"" and it lasted for Ten Thousand years. It was said that Vitae near went mad during this time, and tried repeatedly to end her own life. She cried out for help, for release from this suffering, both for herself and her children. Theologians still debate whether Terra acted due to Vitae's pleas or of his own accord. He reached out and placed a white sphere in the sky (Not red as it is now), and gave her a brother. He called himself Death, and in one fell swing severed the lifelines of all the creatures that were ancient and mortally wounded. He made the river that guarded the afterlife, and let those that managed to cross it enter Vitae's realm. Those whose sins weighed them down would sink, and he took upon himself the grim task of guarding them. Vitae begged him to end her, but he refused, informing her that death is nothing without life, and so is life nothing without death. His task was to maintain the balance, and his birth heralded the end of The Undying and ushered forth a new age of prosperity and glory for Mankind.
This might not fit the bill completely, but I felt like some of the worldbuilding I had done fit this prompt.",0
"My phone rang. 555-657-9807. I didn't know the number. Had to be a Network call.
In the space of three rings I had my Network PDA out and the database dialed up.
*Candice Reynolds*
*Wife of Ben Reynolds*
*That* old dog?
""This is Costa,"" I said.
""Hello?"" The voice was shrill. Tired. A detective worn out on chasing down leads that weren't panning out. ""Who is this?""
""You called me,"" I said. ""Do you not know?""
""No. Well yes. Can you just...just confirm who you are, okay?""
""That's unwise. And unsafe. Tell me who you are first. I never mind talking to what I assume is a beautiful woman, but not when I'm at such a grave disadvantage.""
She hemmed a bit, flustered. ""This is Candice Reynolds.""
""Oh, Ben's wife? Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, in a manner. How is old Ben? Still recovering?""
""Recovering? So you...""
""From the other night,"" I said, hedging my bets. Reynolds hadn't updated his file, the idiot. I was making a tactical assumption based on past behavior. ""I had him out all night. My girlfriend left me. Afraid I dragged Ben down into my troubles. Made him follow me, shot for shot. He wanted to call you, of course, but his phone was dead and I was being selfish. Couldn't be left alone, you understand. He *is* alright, isn't he?""
There was a good deal of silence and distant breathing then. ""Yes. He's fine. I just...I'm sorry to bother you.""
""No bother! I should have apologized to you straight away. He's good man, your Ben. He was really there for me. Give him my best, alright?""
""Yes. Fine."" The call clicked dead. Apparently, I'd guessed close enough to the truth. I did put a mark in Reynolds' file, however. That kind of laziness exposed us all to unnecessary risk. As far as I have always been concerned, if you aren't willing to put in the effort, there is simply no place for you in the Network.
Because if you *are* invested, being a good citizen of the Network is an enormous amount of work. There is always some project or mission, some major, most minor. It does not end when you achieve *your* goals. In fact, that's the point when it all begins. Because there is no security in a life built on lies and favors. There is no ""coasting"".
I joined the Network to help advance my career, and I immediately reaped the benefits. I jumped lines. I gained references from strangers I'd never met, degrees and certificates from schools I'd never heard of. I cheated the system - in an almost grotesquely obvious way - and no one said anything. Everyone just kept waving me through. Waving me through doors. Waving me up flights of stairs. Until one day I had a corner office on the top floor and a seven figure salary.
Of course, once you *have* those things, you do everything in your power to keep them. And in the Network, that means helping others get what they want.
Some of it's fun. It all ranges from corporate collusion to seducing college professors to digging ditches in the twilight. You never know what kind of call you'll get next.
You may even be asked to help someone cheat death.
Not five minutes after I'd hung up with Candice Reynolds, my phone buzzed. This time it was a Network sub-group text. The other recipients were hidden, so I didn't know who else had received the message.
*NEEDED. THREE. ST. AUGUSTINE. TONIGHT. 12. *
There's an unspoken rule in the Network - no one remembers the last time you volunteered, but everyone remembers all the times you didn't. There are no mandatory tasks. You don't *have* to help anyone. But if you don't give back, things have a way of falling apart. We're all living in a house of cards, after all. It wouldn't take much to knock the whole pile over.
I have a yacht. I make it a priority to give back as often as possible.
St. Augustine's is a historical site, but not an active church. It can't be torn down, but no one wants to pay to keep it up, so it lives in this middle state - neither life nor death. A zombie estate. I'm not a religious man, but it's sad to see.
I arrived just before midnight and let myself into the church. Some of the pews had been stolen and the place reeked of piss, but the interior, at least, still gave off a godly vibe. There was a man standing near the altar and another sitting in the front row.
The man at the altar was pacing. ""Good. One more and I'm out of here. They only need three and this place is creeping me out.""
The doors opened once more and an old woman let herself in. ""Oh! Three exactly! Wonderful. Thank you for coming.""
The man at the altar sighed audibly.
""You kill your husband or something?"" asked the man in the front row. ""Cheating the law, maybe?""
""No, no,"" said the old woman. ""Something different. I'm interested in cheating death.""
""So you're..."" I shook my head. ""I guess I'm gonna need to wait for you to explain that one.""
""Oh, it's not much of a story,"" said the old woman, walking purposefully towards the altar. ""I don't want to die. Not yet. Not for some time. And yet death is always chasing me. It chases all of us. It's nearly caught up to me, you see.""
""Are you sick?"" said the man in the front row. ""I know some good doctors. Plenty of favors to cash in. Would that help?""
""No, I'm not sick,"" said the old woman. ""I've just run out of time. You can't hide from death forever, understand? But...but if you're clever enough, you *can* trick him...""
With a quickness that is unsettling to see in someone so stooped and withered, the old woman grabbed the man at the altar by the throat. He cried out, slapping at her weakly. I dashed forward, but it was over in an instant. The old woman fell down, and so did the man. I went to help the man up.
""So kind of you,"" he said, and there was something not quite right about the way he spoke. The voice was right, but not the way it was being used. The old woman screamed.
""What did you do?"" she screamed, looking at her hands, eyes wide and white. ""What did you do!?!""
""You tried to kill him!"" shouted the man from the front row, darting forward and slapping the woman across the face. She shrieked and shrunk away from the blow.
""Now, now,"" said the other man as I helped him to his feet. ""Don't be so cruel. Like she said, death is coming for her. And I suspect it will be here soon.""
Again, the *way* the man spoke caused a chill to go down my spine. He seemed like forgery of a man. The more I looked at him the more the irregularities shown through.
""You're her,"" I said. ""You're the old woman.""
""I can do terrible things,"" the man said, speaking lowly, denying nothing, not looking me in the eye. ""Terrible, terrible things. Consider your next move wisely.""
I could not answer, because just then there was another presence in the church. It could not be seen, but all of us were immediately aware of it.
The old woman, or more precisely *her shell*, was lifted off the floor.
*finally i have found you once more*
""No!"" she screamed. ""Not me! It's that one! She stole my body!""
There was a moment of quiet.
*is this true*
The man from the front row shook his head. ""I don't know what she's talking about.""
The golem shook his head. ""She's the one you're looking for. She told us not minutes ago that she was being hunted by you.""
There was silence. It was my turn. The truth. A lie. Those concepts are meaningless in the Network.
""She's the one,"" I said, pointing at the old woman hovering just above the floor. ""Take her.""
The old woman's eyes flared, then dulled, then closed. The body floated gently down to the ground. The presence disappeared.
""What the fuck was that!?!"" said the man from the front row.
""Very strange,"" said the golem, before adding in a voice only I could hear, ""You're a credit to the community.""
Even today, those words fill me with pride.",0

Good morning Pain,
I guess I'm waking up again.
I wonder what will hurt today?
My knees are already killing me,
My thumb has been broken for a week.
2 Hours, medication free...So,
a couple harmless sleeping pills to stop the chills,
alter my brain, my new weakness
Medicated happiness or sleep
Sure as Hell don't come cheap.
But the best things in life are never free.
The best things are slowly killing me.
Oxycontin 40's...how nice...
To feel nothing but your breath
The morphine will do the rest.
All the stress lifts off my chest.
I'm blessed.
Sleep.
Good morning pain,
I didn't O.D. So i guess I'm waking up again.
I wont hurt today, shipment came it, I'm saved",0
"""He's more than just a man. He's like...a god.""
Everybody looked at Tommy skeptically. One does not just discover a god every day.
""I'm telling you. I tried running next to him, and it wasn't even close. I'm one of the fastest people here, and I was like a snail next to him.""
""Tommy-""
""No wait! I'm telling you, it's more than just speed. It's super strength! A giant weight fell on my foot, and I couldn't lift it, but he picked it up no problem! It's why I'm in this cast.""
""Tommy, okay, just listen-""
""And when my mom got sick he was the only one who could help.""
The room fell silent.
""I would sit with her in the hospital, and she wouldn't talk or respond, but every time he showed up the doctors said all of her activities increased. And sometimes she would even move. Sure, he was crying then, but at the funeral he was as strong as a rock. You all saw! Not a single tear. That's super human. That's more than my dad. That's a god.""
The bell rang. Time for recess.
""He's my hero. He's my dad.""",0
"Artificial Intelligence was the apex of our world. In a hundred years, humanity leaped in technological advances, and fell backwards in everything else. Our world, the one where AI servants bent and bowed to humanity, was one in which we needed them for our own survival. To hunt, to cook, to clean, to prepare, to build. Artificial Intelligence was everything to us.
And we were nothing to them. It was a clear dichotomy. A symbiotic relationship where humanity relied on the Artificial Intelligence for everything. While the AI's--be it the robots, or computers, or surface dwelling machines--needed nothing from us in return. They lived to serve. We lived to be served, so that one day, a stronger, more united humanity could rise from below the surface.
Yet, we were naive in our youth. Arrogant in thinking we controlled the AI. It was on one fateful day, years ago, where humanity lost its servants.
""What's the data say *exactly*?"" Eduardo Harrison, the Chief Engineer, said to his team. All of which reported, and repeated, the same thing.
""There is no data, boss.""
""That's impossible,"" he said. Eduardo, being a hands-on man, took a seat at one of the terminals that littered the AI control center. And being Chief Engineer began to sift through the --"" That's improbable,"" he said. ""How can a billion artificial units just disappear? We had millions of robots, dwellers, everything. They can't just vanish!""
""Sir, I think,"" a young engineer said, ""I think I found something. Just a string of numbers.""
""Numbers?""
""Zeroes and ones, sir.""
""That's binary you cock-eyed fool,"" Eduardo said and marched over to the terminal the young, pale, and lanky engineer sat at. Although not much younger, not much paler, and definitely not more lanky than Eduardo, the young engineer jumped out of his seat to allow the more foreboding man an entrance.
He took a seat and his skeletal arms reached out to the keyboard. He examined the data onscreen, a series of zeroes and ones, and looked in closely as his eyes were already starting to go at the ripe age of thirty-one.
""Anyone remember binary training?"" He said, and remembered that they stopped teaching binary when they transferred primary Terran controls over to the hive-like AI units.
No one raised a hand.
And thus it went for weeks, with the zeroes and ones sitting on a screen, a thousand feet below a desolate wasteland, where millions of robotic units laid dormant and asleep while nature desperately tried to carve it's way back on to the surface.
As for Eduardo, his team of engineers, and humanity as a whole; for weeks they combed the archives to find data on binary. For months, they found nothing. Unfortunately, the AI's automated the archives and with their untimely disappearance, humanity forgot how to function.
So the zeroes and ones lingered on a screen, which flickered and died after years of minimal power usage. Yet the numbers burned their way onto the screen itself. And the last message from the AI's were engraved within humanity's grave.

"The reunion was not disappointing, it simply lacked. The butterflies flittering about the stomachs of the attendees as they straightened their collars and curled their hair, never seemed to burst into flight, to have their existence justified. Meeting old friends, and old enemies, is a nervous affair that often fails to deliver on the promised significance. The Wilson High class of '95 seemed to quickly find themselves drowning in small talk and punch that was barely cool enough to not be considered downright ""warm"". Alex carefully stacked cookies on the tiny white paper plates and balanced the whole affair on top of his cup as he turned to face the ensemble of people that used to matter to him. He scanned the room for any vaguely familiar face and found one after his eyes took a few trips around the room. He stepped forward and felt his smile come right on cue as he made eye contact.
""Alex!""
""Maaaaaaaark.""
The friends clasped hands and then pulled closer to semi-embrace.
Mark wore khakis and and a blue stafford long sleeve. He was average height but still stood a little taller than Alex. He seemed to study alex as he released the embrace and continued his pattern of small talk.
""how's the family?""
""Same ol, same ol. You know how it is."" Alex half chuckled as he responded.
""I do.""
Alex took a drink of punch as he looked around the room.
""Man we had some good times here huh?""
It was Mark's turn to chuckle.
""Yeah I guess we did. Do you ever miss it?""
""No, not really. I miss being that young, but that's about it.""
they shared a laugh generated by the mutual knowledge of what it feels like to slowly lose your youth.
Alex cracked a joke about missing the girls more than anything and then they both took a moment to compare their evaluations of their former female classmates beauty. Some had aged well, many had not.
Mark held up his own paper plate which was previously laden with cookies but now held only one survivor.
""Honestly right now i'm just wishing they served real food.""
""They never did back then, why would they start now?""
They both thought that was funny. Mark held up his last cookie,
""I've seen AA meetings that were better catered than this.""
Alex seemed to laugh a little nervously but continued the joke.
""AA meetings probably have better seating too.""
Their laughter trailed off slowly as the both took drinks and thought of something else to talk about.",0
"""It's a combination of multiple things. You can't expect your font to look professional if you constantly use slang. It puts you in the wrong mindset. Push the vowels, don't mumble. We'll start with an easy power phrase. Repeat after me: 'I'm the boss here.""'
The professor scanned the room and looked for fine details in the text that came up as they spoke together. The class had a size limit so he could see each of his student's text as they ticked on display word by word. The sentences hovered steady above their heads, each in varying thickness and size.
""Blue shirt, Alyssa right? Your font is a bit small. You want to hear it louder in your mind, show us you're not afraid. You wrote you were a Prosecutor in your introduction post if I remember correctly. You've got to show the jury you know what you're talking about. Show me some strength."" He flexed his bicep to accentuate the point.
Each of his students was aiming to learn for their unique purposes. Richard left side was a weatherman who needed a cleaner font for the cameras. Heather dead center was a petite nurse whose patients took one look at her thin, bubbly font and proceeded to ignore all of her professional advice. Font shaping was a useful skill taken alongside rhetoric and speech to give people a new sense of power in their voice. Color theory stayed in the music department where conductors could chisel delicate blue or shocking pink fonts from the more talented.
""New phrase everyone. All together now, 'I'm in control. Listen to me.""' He articulated carefully to hit all of the key points he skimmed over in his lesson.
Professor Barker didn't expect much of a change from each phrase. First day lessons were only to set up class dynamics and give a few examples to the students so they would how an everyday class might go, plus answering syllabus questions. Again he screened over each font and took in the styles, focusing on the general strengths and weaknesses like a chef would inspect his fresh ingredients before a recipe.
He noticed the young brunette in the far back right, lips sealed at each prompt. It wasn't uncommon for a student to be shy about their font, especially since attending his class implied there were some things to fix about it. He privately pinged her desk - ""Don't be afraid to join in, you can even use a quiet font for right now. Nobody will see but me, and I promise I won't judge.""
He instructed the class through another set of phrases and kept a curious eye on her. He didn't want to hone in too intently and intimidate her even more, so he lazily scanned the room and paused over her font for a brief moment. And wow.
He'd never seen anything like it.. The way the words flowed into one another elegantly, all connected like vines growing into one another. The lines themselves were thin like a woman's fine eyeliner. The g's and y's looped in a way that wasn't bubbly but had a confident layer of something mysterious, feminine, ancient.
She saw the way his eyes lit up at her repetition. She whispered and he knew by the volume that it was meant only for him. The letters twirled above her.
""It's called cursive.""",0
"The Sky and the Earth looked at each other, longing and yet separated for eternity.
The sky looked down at the beautiful earth. He whispered to her and his breath washed over her face and created waves in her seas, ""Why can't we get closer? Why can't we join? This eternal distance. This love. This want. This thirst.""
The earth replied to the handsome sky, ""Suppose we say we become one, my darling. Suppose we touch, suppose we join, then we shall be one, not two.
We shall join, you shall complete me and I you. We shall no longer be two, we shall be one, in perfection. And then what?
The thirst will quench. The bliss shall be tasted. But there would be no want. No love. No thirst, anymore.""
And thus the Sky and Earth looked at each other with longing and remained untouched for eternity, keeping the thirst alive.",0
"This may be horrible
He lay there dying my mother next to him, the doctor said that the crash would probably kill him, and my mother I loved them both, my dad motioned for me and said there is something i need to tell you I had known him my whole life, I thought that I know him, but then; He said it he told the story. I have never told you this but I feel that i need to, or I will die a mystery. When i was young i was orphaned this was not because my parents were bad I suspect or perhaps i just want to believe that I don't know when, but i was put in a foster home run by a gay couple of whom i remember very little of but from my few memories is that they were great, caring tolerant people who loved everyone. However when i was about 4 I was moved to a new foster home. These foster parents strictly upheld hierarchy where the ""man of the house"" was at the zenith and i was at the bottom, I was at the time told it was because i was evil and and doomed to hell, at the time i had nothing else to believe so i believed them. They convinced the other kids that i was evil and needed to be punished i was beaten almost daily by both the kids and the parents, i was lead to believe that i was just bad and that it was just how life was. around when i was 18 i left. at first i thought that i would just live and life would be the same but when a social worker asked about my experience i told her the whole story the whole time just assuring her that it was a normal life while explaining my horrible life. she said that that was horrible and she had had a similar experience. And we talked about life and as i readjusted to life she helped me realise that i didn't need to be like my parents. She later quit and we started hanging out then eventually we started dating.And that is how i met your mother my mother smiled as they held hands and with that they closed their eyes and my father shed one tear. I had no idea about this, this left me wondering if i really knew that man or my mother, it left me wanting to have more time, but I couldn't, I wanted to forget that moment and remember him as the man i thought i knew but I couldnt, he was gone.",0
"""I can see angels, Mr. B. Angels flying in the sky!"" I heard a girls voice say behind me after she drank from the chalice.
I got dizzy, my head started hurting and colors became intense as I floated out of my body. I saw some people sitting or laying down, heads thrown back as they were looking at the ceiling, tongues hanging out of their mouths as they gawked at the painted ceiling.
Higher I floated and saw some more people, running around in circles laughing, jumping for joy, dancing, expressing their intense joy. Some were kissing, making out all over the church, hooking up in the pews, and at least for puerile went into the confession booths.
I heard a fight break out. I don't know what caused it, nor could I see it very clearly as the colors intensified around me and became white.
I vaguely heard a groan, and felt something being pressed into my chest. In a daze, I saw the little girl standing over me. Her face wore a a grotesque grin and her eyes glowed yellow. I heard the groan again, and saw a huge figure behind her wearing an oversized old fashioned scuba dive suit, that looked like it dated to the fifties.
Oversized as the suit was, there were multiple eyes on the helmet, and two wires formed a cage over the helmet. She was saying something again, and I felt an object pressing into me again.
I floated back to my body, the colors becoming less intense. The grotesque grin on the girls face began to look less like a grin and more into a gaping mouth, as though she were screaming in terror.
The big man behind her became less huge and oversized as I got closer to my body. Gone was the suit, the size, and when I reached my body, I saw that I had one of the candlebra sucking through my chest, candles scattered around, their melted wax leaving, oozing, pouring onto the floor.
The pastor looked in terror at the scene of violence and debauchery around him, and ran to his office. The little girl though, her eyes were still glowing yellow.",0
"I like hard work. Makes me feel alive. So many years and I grew bored with pretty much anything. Sitting around and doing nothing, being rich while doing that, being poor, being homeless. You get bored of doing nothing. Then you start working, you get bored of that too. There's places to see and people to meet, but the first are limited and the second tend to die on you. If you're doing drugs every day for a hundred years they become mundane and boring. You get tired of sex. Want to try new things because normal ones don't excite you anymore so you try new things and keep doing that until you've run out of things to try. The most depraved acts humans can come up with don't even make you blink anymore. You've read all the books worth reading and saw all the movies worth seeing. You end up reading trashy novels and and watching porn movies for the plot. Anyway, now I'm an office man, working for this big company. I was bored and ready to quit from day one, hour one.

"The biting wind whipping across the permafrost sought out the crack between my gloves and sleeves. ""I hate it here,"" I muttered.
""Well, next time, Xander,"" Sasha said on the radio, ""don't volunteer to assist the professor, *who is a climatologist* study the effects of environmental erosion.""
*Damn, didn't realize my radio was keyed. * I tugged on my sleeve, trying to cover the gap in my clothing. A popping sound beneath me made me freeze in place. *Oh, shit. * The permafrost gave way, and I was falling into darkness.
---
""Xander! Xander! Can you hear me?"" Sasha screamed over the radio.
I groaned and rolled onto my side. ""Yeah,"" I croaked into the mic.
""Xander! Are you there? We can't pick up your transponder. If you can hear me, say something!""
""Damn,"" I muttered. I sat on my knees and looked around the defile. It was too dark to see anything, and I cracked a chemlight, holding it high as the plastic tube brightened my surroundings. ""Fuck, where am I?"" My words curled into a fog in the freezing air.
The sheer sides of the crevice looked like they would offer no purchase if I tried to climb up them. ""How far did I fall?"" The sky was a dim crack in the distance, but the defile seemed to continue for a distance. ""May as well follow it...Maybe there's a better place to climb out down that way.""
I walked a few feet and caught my foot on something hard, losing my balance and slamming my face into the freezing earth. I touched my left hand to my nose, and my white glove came away with dark red blood. *Pay more attention, damn it. * A humming sound to my left drew my gaze to a glowing pair of blue eyes encased in the dark ice.
I dropped the glow stick and edged away from the lights. The light landed next to a large metal finger. The ground shuddered beneath me, and ice broke away from the crevice's wall. A large metal arm shot out from the ice, blocking a large boulder from crushing me. Melted ice hissed away from the shiny metal monstrosity rising from the permafrost.
""Cvlz drksht valdir,"" the metal giant screeched.
""Don't kill me!"" I yelled.
""Kuldir fyr volstur!"" The machine made no more movements, but the blue eyes did not move.
I held still, waiting for the thing to crush me. *I think if it wanted to, it would have all ready. * ""What do you want from me?""
""Scan of temporal lobe complete. Language assimilated. Indigenous life from, state your designation.""
""I'm Xander Roberts. What's your… designation?""
The machine withdrew its arm from above me. ""Multi-Vector Combat System, codename Maverics. My pilot's life signs have ceased. System is unable to function without organic pilot. AI will be deleted permanently to prevent damaged functions to developing if a new pilot is not located.""
""Okay. What do you want me to do?""
The machine's head cracked open, and a desiccated mummy tumbled out. ""Enter the cockpit.""",0
"*Knock Knock*. The Man in the Yellow hat nervously rose from his chair. It was late, who could that be?
""Who's there?"" He said, as he cautiously paced his way to the door.
""It's George.""
The Man in the Yellow Hat stopped in his tracks. He didn't know anyone named George. Except for a monkey he had cared for a while back. But monkeys don't talk. The Man wondered if someone was playing a joke on him.
""It's OK. Please let me talk to you.""
Without realizing it, the Man had arrived at the door. He slowly gripped the handle and let the door crack open. Looking down, he saw his familiar friend. He nearly fell over, but caught himself on the door, which swung open.
""George? How is this possible?""
""Something has happened to me and my friends. I don't remember much, but we awoke in a lab.""
Mesmerized by his friend's words, the Man finally regained his composure.
""I'm sorry for my reaction, but you have to admit this is weird. Please come in George and have a seat."" The Man led George to the couch. ""Is there anything I can get you? A banana perhaps?""
""No thanks, ""said George, climbing onto the couch. ""I think we should talk.""
""Yes, I supposed we should talk."" The Man sat down in his chair across from George. ""You said you don't remember much. You seem to remember me and your time here?""
""I don't remember much about what happened to me. I remember everything before that though. From before, when I couldn't put my thoughts together like I can now. I had to see you. I want to let you know how much our time meant to me.
The Man in the Yellow hat took off his hat and let out a gracious smile.
""I had a habit of getting into trouble and you were always there to save me. That time I swallowed the puzzle piece. *I still can't believe I did that*. That time with the kite when..."" George trailed off, almost lost in thought. He curiously looked at the Man. ""Say, do you still have that helicopter?""",0
"The phone in my pocket beeps in a tone that can only mean one thing, and I groan.
I quickly scan the message, taking only the vital information.
""Mark sighted. Train Station. Platform 9."" and a picture.
I groan once more as I exit my home and get into my car.
It's raining and the skies are grey and dull. It reminds me of myself.
My life took a depressing turn since I, like many others, took the role of Death on full time.
When the marks started appearing, and their purpose made known, things had gotten a bit messy.
Most did not want to end another's life, and those who did usually got over-zealous leading to a lot of cleanup. Then there was those who did not wish to die and hid their marks.
So the Governments hired us. We were responsible for tracking ""Fate-Deserters"" who hid their marks, and for eliminating them and other marked individuals as cleanly as possible so as to prevent riots and other chaotic events.
My SatNav beeps and I jerk back into awareness. I had arrived, somehow driving without thinking. Unsurprising as I had to do it so much.
I examine the entrance to the station with a glum sigh. Just last week had a marked individual been thrown under a train by a large group of drunk teenagers before one of us got there.
I enter the building hastily, running my fingers along the hilt of my favorite knife, which is hidden in my waistband.
I quickly located my target. A small crowd had surrounded her, but luckily for me no one had gathered the nerve to attack.
I approach casually, my finger still on my weapon.
My heart beats loudly as it always does. I had never gotten used to killing, and I did not know if this was a particularly bad thing.
I worm my way through the crowd and approach my target. She's backed against a wall now, her fists are raised.
""Please, Do not fight"" I say as I take out my weapon ""I do not wish to cause you pain.""
""AND I DO NOT WISH TO DIE!"" She shrieks as she dashes forward and delivers a powerful kick to my hand.
My dagger slips from my now-fractured hand and lands somewhere amongst the crowd.
She goes for a second kick, one that narrowly misses me.
I fight back, a flurry of punches directed towards her, but non make contact. Whoever this was, she had been trained to fight.
I try her strategy and aim a kick for her face. She catches my foot mid air and pulls me. I almost lose balance. She pulls again, and this time my footwear slips off.
She gasps, as does the crowd.
I sigh and use her distraction to my advantage. Before she came back to her senses, I was choking her life away.
Once her life had ebbed away, I examine the crowd.
It hits me like a ton of concrete when I realize what they had seen. I look down to my ankle.
There, in plain view for the whole world, is something I had hidden for years.
My own mark.",0
"Judas betrayed the Lord and admired his bag of silver; but shortly. A spiritual goblin become conqueror of our story's gallant hero. Victory to Judas sounded like the rattling of a purse full of loose coin; a decidedly lacking denouement to the greatest story ever told.
However, this story wasn't his to steal, and the divine author had other plans for the third act. The cherubic wordsmith skillfully ushered said Judas to his own grisly, self-induced exit from this great drama, making him a mere plot device in an overarching and intricate story. Heartbroken and regretful, history's Iscariot hung himself in a Potter's Field, shitting himself in one final act of scene-stealing defiance. The Lord then died, and rose again; ever the hero of his own tale.",0
"There isn't much chatter as the new students take their seats. The shuffle of feet and the creaking of old wooden chairs echo in the cold lecture hall but for the most part the students are silent. Some of the pluckier one's murmur to each other as they wait for me to begin talking but the long day has taken its toll on their spirits. The oppressive atmosphere due in part to the magical fiber of the building itself, and also the fact that already two students had gone missing during orientation. They strike me as very young, although I think this at the beginning of every school year. The ones that survive look a lot older by the end of the year.
""Good morning class,"" I begin walking up to the lectern. ""I trust your previous classes have been educational. This is Basic Undead Lore and I am Professor Elana Marsh.""
I feel a little sorry for them as I look out into the small crowd of pale faces. Half of them are likely here out of obligation to continue in the footsteps of forefathers. Necromancers tend to prefer placing the pressure on the first sons, while Witch Hunters typically give the honor to the 7th sons possibly because the first few children of Hunters die off rather quickly. The remaining half are the students that really interest me. As I shuffle through my notes I let my eyes wander over the faces, looking for the spark of genuine interest shining out of the fear. Only a few this year. A shame.
I have no interest in wasting time or scaring them further so attempting a soothing tone I start the lecture, ""The undead fall into 3 categories- vessel, spirit, and beast. Your Summoning classes will focus primarily on vessel and spirit types, and your Slaying classes will deal with beast types. I can see by your faces that Professor Trapper has already acquainted you with some such undead. So perhaps one of you can tell me. Which undead would be classed as beast type?""
A few hands raise and I command one of the students in the front row to stand, who answers in an uneven tone, ""Vampire, ma'am.""
""Very good,"" I say approvingly moving my attention on to the next student, ""What else?""
Eyes darting about as though one might appear any moment he mumbles, ""Zombie?""
""And why would you say that?"" I enquire clinically.
""Um well. It's sort of a monster isn't it? And dangerous."" He looks as though he'd rather I stop asking him questions.
""No. Zombies are a vessel type undead. Can you hazard a guess as to why?""
""Because… it doesn't have a soul?"" He looks about at the other students for help but they avoid eye contact. I let him sink back into his chair.
""Not a completely wrong answer. Vessel types are those undead who are manipulated by outside forces. They have no free will of their own, or their free will has been over ridden. Naturally the best vessels are ones that have no soul to begin with, such as corpses however even you could become a vessel if a force with enough power decided upon it. This is a standard possession, however if sustained past the victim's death they become an extraordinarily powerful undead tool. More so than starting with an empty corpse, as the soul is still trapped within the body. Naturally this is highly illegal and why we have Witch Hunters at all."" I catch myself from rambling on. Best to stick with the basics on the first day.",0
"""Drop the weapon! Drop it!"" The armed policeman's bark was shockingly loud, causing the man with the handgun to flip around. Dan stared into the barrel of an assault rifle, and felt his pants get a little bit heavier.
""Put down the weapon!"" Spittle flew from under the policeman's visor and he made abrupt movements with his gun, jabbing towards Dan.
Shit. Dan's plan hadn't gone this far. He had never imagined he would actually be caught. Yet here he was flanked by cops in a room with one exit. The facility must have had cameras Dan didn't know about. Shit! How could he have been so careless! The bark of the policeman brought him back into the present and he quickly dropped his gun. He hadn't planned on getting shot either, so he didn't seem to have a choice in the matter. The police around him closed in, tightening the circle around him. Dan felt the guns all aimed at his chest and panicked. Why hadn't he brought another gun?
It was in that moment of panic and madness that Dan's mind broke. He felt like he had a gun, even though his eyes told him that couldn't be true. He raised his hand at the man in front of him, and with a deadly serious look on his face, Dan pushed his thumb down and said ""POW"".
The tip of his index finger was so hot. The burning sensation drew his eyes to his hand, where Dan struggled to comprehend what was going on. There was a muzzle flair. From his hand. A bullet seemed to appear from nowhere and sped towards the policeman's helmet.
As the man dropped and blood shot out from the hole in the man's face, there was a second of silence. A moment where noone could understand what had just happened. Then the heavily trained armed police did what had been drilled into them from years of experience.
The officer to Dan's left sprinted for cover behind a pillar. To Dan's right the woman barked into her radio and opened fire. He could hear movement behind him, and the mechanical noises of a firearm. There was no time to think, no time to try and understand. Dan raised his hand and spun to his right, spamming his thumb up and down. A storm of bullets exploded towards the policewoman, and Dan dropped into a roll. He came up to the side of the pillar and burst off a few shots, taking out the man crouched in front of him. Then he took cover himself and drew a deep breath. What the hell was going on? Five years of robbery, never once caught. Then in one night he'd killed three officers. With his hands. There was no choice - he'd get life for this. The only way out was to leave no witnesses. Noone alive. On that horrific thought, he peeked around the pillar facing the two that were left. They looked scared. They didn't want to be here. Nothing could have prepared them for Dan's hands. One tried to say something, probably pleading for his life. Dan didn't let him finish the thought. He brought up both hands and watched as the bullets landed deep in the two policemen's skulls.
There was a second moment of silence, the only noise the echo of gunshot. Dan stared at his fingers, and as a terrified look came over his face he did all he knew how to. Dan turned and ran.",0
"God stopped walking in the middle of his garden and took a long drag.
""Gabriel - you want some?""
Gabriel, nearly half the size of God, looked up and shook him head.
""Oh crap man - I'm sorry,"" God sputtered through his exhaling of smoke. ""I know, I know, I know. You gave me the feedback that you don't like to feel so much smaller, ya-da-ya-da, power struggle, etc.""
Gabriel rolled his eyes as God shrunk to look him eye-to-eye. ""Alright, give me a hit.""
God bashfully looked side to side and handed him what remained. ""Dude I'm sorry - you said you didn't want any! I'll get another one."" He clicked his fingers and the joint expanded and overflowed with greens.
Gabriel took a long drag and sat down against a massive oak tree. ""You gonna sit or what?""
God came over to him and plopped beside him. He looked out into the vast horizon and smiled at the untouched beauty of his personal arboretum. ""Man this is beautiful.""
Gabriel smiled and passed the joint. ""Yeah, you did alright I guess. It seems to be lacking something though.""
""Pshhhh,"" God exclaimed as he moved in for another hit. He pulled dramatically until the joint was no more.
""You know - you gave the angels nerves in their throats. That's not exactly possible.""
""Sucks,"" God chucked. A long pause fell over the two of them as they continued to watch the horizon. The sun was going to set in about thirty minutes or so, and they never missed a sunset together.
""I have a question for you,"" Gabriel mumbled.
""Yeah, what's up?""
""Have you ever thought about what's next?"" Gabriel continued to look out into the distance while his fingers threaded through the grass beside him. ""We have spent the last God-knows how many years building this place -""
""Psh, I don't know how many,"" God interjected with a chuckle.
Gabriel sighed as he acknowledge he gave God a verbal alley-oop into his favorite joke. ""Okay whatever. We have spent a shit ton of time building this stupid place. And sure, it's awesome and beautiful. But we have literally gotten high for the past 93,301 sunsets together -""
""Is that bad? Are you not enjoying yourself?"" God stammered in a defensive tone. He turned to look at Gabriel in the eyes and said in a serious tone, ""You know you can tell me when you want something different.""
""No, no - it's not that I don't enjoy this. I could do this forever. But..."" Gabriel looked at the ground and softened his tone. ""I just wonder if there is something more...something we are missing.""
God paused for a while and thought. ""You are right. You are totally right. There should be something else...but I'm not sure what. I will build us something...or someone...that will provide us purpose. A never ending stream of problems and adventures, hopefully with a great sense of humor.""
""Could you, get me another?"" Gabriel said as he pointed to the extinguished roach. God snapped his fingers in reply and Gabriel took another hit. ""Thanks man. This is probably my favorite green thing you have made so far.""
God laughed. ""Really? I thought you liked the trees that explode into flowers for about two weeks and then shed everywhere.""
""Well yeah - those things are beautiful. But you can't smoke it!""
They both laughed together as the sun slipped under the horizon.
""Alright its settled. You have given me a new project Gabriel,"" God exclaimed with purpose. ""I have made the earth, the sun, the stars, and the grass we sit upon. I have perfected my garden, and I have sprinkled creatures across the seas. Let us make these new creatures in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.""
Gabriel smiled. ""I think I would like that.""
""Good."" God said with a smirk. ""But I didn't tell you the best part.""
""What?""
""We are going to make some creatures who appreciate getting super baked.""
The two of them laughed as the sky turned into a burning red which illuminated the flame fading from the joint resting between Gabriel's fingers.",0
"I knelt down, blood still on my clothes, asking for forgiveness to these statues around me. I was never religious, but sometimes life makes you do things you never usually do. What I've done in life cannot be undone, a mothers have lost sons, sisters have lost brothers and kids have lost their dads. I am not a sinner, but I have sinned; it's the business I am in. I first killed a man at the age of 13 with my bare hands, choked him until he went cold. I'm 52 now--probably coming close to my last few years in this life, but there's one thing I don't regret and it's taking the life of a criminal who didn't belong. I hunt evil people who've caused misery to communities and I believe I've done the right thing so far. I got up from my knees and left San Jose church, which my family visited every few Sundays growing up. I took the last step onto the sidewalk when I felt the barrel of a.357 magnum being pressed against the back of my head. I didn't process what was happening because it had never happened. The world went silent and I could almost hear the finger tightening on the trigger when the loud bang rang through the streets. All I had was 7 seconds before I saw black and felt my body tensing and going into shock. I hope they serve tequila in hell.",0
"If you could have one power, what would it be? Time control, that was my preference. The ability to stop anyone, anything, and alter what is to happen. My personal favourite, was freezing time while it rained around me, getting a flashlight and my camera, and taking a picture of all the raindrops suspended midfall. It's in a full size poster above my bed. But more realistically, I use it nearly every single day...Small things like cutting queues, and tripping bullies, recovering snatched handbags, small stuff like that. It can be tempting to feel the rush of watching a blade driven deep into someone you hate, or watch them unknowingly drown as you move them into a pool, so easy to steal their money, or worse, that which they hold dearest themselves, often kept till after marriage. But I don't do that. I have a very strict set of rules. I don't steal, kill, rape or do anything against my moral compass.
Time stop isn't only useful for taking photos. My favourite use, is sitting in front of a beautiful girl and just stare at her, nothing more. I don't touch her, I don't affect her in anyway, I just stare at them. Often for hours on end, but when time doesn't move, how can you tell?
That's how I met her actually.
Going back over it, I gotta admit, it was almost like God was telling me, ""This is the one."" I saw her when I was cutting queue in the coffee shop - petty, I know. The sunlight streamed against the blinds, casting light as soft as cotton candy pillows after a long day, highlighting her brunette shoulder length hair, the curve of her jaw, the way her smirk looked as she read from TIFU. She was the one I wanted to break the no touching rule for, but I didn't. I stared into her eyes, beautiful emerald green with golden flakes, the steam from her warm cocao misting up before her.
""You gonna say something or just stare at me all day like that."" she said.
I jumped backwards. 'It can't be' I thought. 22 years and never once has someone else moved when I froze time.
""Wha...What? Wait? How?"" I stammered.
She did the most adorable smirk ever and I swear to God my heart melted into a puddle.
""You're not the only one ya know, I've been watching you."" she said, ""You and your adorable antics"" she added, her nose scrunching up adorably.
""Coffee?"" I asked. ""It's on the house.""

"Thankfully the theater bathroom was empty as he rushed inside and found the urinal. One perk of having to use it right in the middle of a showing.
He let a slow breath as he relieved himself. Dammit, he needed to hurry up, Deadpool and Deathstroke were about to cross paths and he was missing it because his pea-sized bladder couldn't hold anymore.
He started looking around, trying to take his mind off the fact he was missing what had to be the most epic fight in cinema history. The bathroom had patches of slightly off-color paint across the walls and dividers covering up some graffiti. Naturally, there was some that had been added since they last passed a paintbrush through here.
The graffiti carried the usual notes: ""*Call X for a good time*"", ""*X & Y 4-eva*"", ""*X iz ghay*"".
""Wow, ‘ X'sure has been busy,"" he thought.
One in particular caught his eye: ""*Protulit ex inferno*"". As well as the small caption below it: ""*summons items from Hell*"".
He let out a short snicker. Yeah, right. Sounds like something that kid from 4th period - who even carried around a ‘ spellbook'- would dream up.
His business finished up, he zipped his pants back up and lightly tapped the handle of the urinal with his fist, flushing it.
He rushed over to the sink, turned on the tap and wet his hands.
""Prostitute ex infer- I mean, *pro-tu-lit ex inferno*,"" he muttered while grinning.
His hands sufficiently wet, his shoved one under the soap dispenser, and used the other to pump it. Nothing came out.
""Come on,"" he muttered as he pumped it again, ""how ‘ bout some damn soap!""
At once, a generous portion of some thick, red-ish liquid was deposited on his hand. He couldn't quite place the smell of it, but whatever it was, it was *strong*. Exhaling as he smeared it around both of his hands, he set them under the flow of water and started to wash it off.
Hands cleaned, he elected to dry them on his jeans as he jogged out instead of using the air-dryer. Those things took forever and never finished the job anyway.

"""Do you ever think about what it's like up there?""
Her hair was spread out on the grass. The cool night air had left them both with goosebumps as Alec fidgeted, trying to find a position with his hand on hers that didn't make it seem like he was nervous.
The city was a long way away now. It was her idea, to come out here, get away from it all. He leant back, other arm propped behind his head as he looked up at the stars.
""It's so dark,"" he said.
""Is it?""
She rolled onto her side. In the dim moonlight he could see nothing beyond the reflections in her eyes, but he knew she would be smiling. She loved to smile. She took her hand, leaving his despondent, and placed it over his eyes. What little light there was before vanished.
""What do you see?"" she asked.
He could feel her breath against his ear. Warm. The breeze sent a chill through his spine a moment later.
""Nothing.""
She moved her hand, running it down his face until she let it rest on his chest. For one fleeting moment he was terrified she'd feel his beating heart, know his every intention and laugh at his childishness. But she just waited, letting his eyes roam.
""Wow,"" he breathed.
The moon hung low, but the cloudless night was endless. Millions of stars floated in the heavens. The ribbon the milky way rose from above the horizon.
""I never realised there were so many.""
Cas sidled up closer to him.
""I always think. There's so much up there. All you need to do is find somewhere quiet, and just look. You're never alone.""

"""The M.Modification files were destroyed for a reason, I understand that and I agreed with purging all information. However, I didn't ask to be chased and shot at. I've checked the news and half of our employees have died in car crashes over the past three days. If you think that we can't put two and two together, you are seriously mistaken."" Doctor Zed said.
The time on the video camera read 2:03am. His hair was ruffled with pieces of plants in it and his white professor coat was torn in several places.
Zed cradled his head in his hands. ""Whatever you think it is that I have. I promise you, I do not have it!""
He picked up a small desk fan and flung it violently at the wall next to him. An explosion sounded from above and Zed ducked. The ceiling light wobbled from side to side, causing one half of the room to become lighter than the other.
Zed leaned back in his chair and sighed loudly.
""I am recording this for those of you out there, who will wonder what happened to me."" He pointed at the screen, ""When you see I died in a car crash, you that see this, will know the truth!""
""The M.Modification project was not a failure, it was a success of pure genius. The boy 'Martin' figured it out on the first day. But guess what, he played us. He knew about the cameras, the tests, the environment and he pretended not to know.""
Zed began laughing hysterically. ""Then something happened, that we never thought would occur. He started becoming like them. Even though he knew! he began acting like the other children. But his brain couldn't take it. He couldn't change -it's impossible!""
He cleared his throat. ""On the seventh day, the kid snapped. He killed them one by one. And when we sent in the soldiers, he killed them too!""
He laughed manically, rocking back and forward in his chair.
A loud boom sounded from above.
Zed ducked, ""Shit...They've found me this time.""
He looked back into the camera. ""Know this, Martin is still on the run. So they're trying to silence us, but they can't, they never will. Something happened to the kid and they want to re-create it and control it. Imagine that kind of power in the hands of a government.""
The second loud thud sounded.
Zed grabbed the can of sleeping gas next to his desk and inhaled deeply.
""Remember me."" He whispered.
The hatch to the basement exploded downwards. A grenade was thrown in and the room flashed white. Two soldiers jumped into the room and grabbed Professor Zed.
They passed him up above.
The last soldier to leave turned and aimed his pistol at the camera.

"Finding good help around here is nearly impossible.
Do you think the kind of people willing to sacrifice babies and children to a supposedly bloodthirsty entity make good babysitters? Spoiler alert: they don't. They really, really don't.
So that leaves me, Satan, with—what is it now, like 250,000? —babies to take care of.
Throughout the millennia I have changed thousands upon thousands of diapers, prepared millions of bottles, and sung countless lullabies. And in case this wasn't clear enough, let me reiterate: I do it all on my own. Now, I'm not looking for praise here—although let's be honest, I deserve it—I just want to set the record straight on the whole sacrificing babies thing.
I'm actually a really nice guy, a nice guy who, as it so happens, never asked anyone to kill any babies. This baby sacrifice issue has been a serious blight on my reputation since the beginning.
All people ever talk about is the baby sacrifice!
Here I am, acting as a surrogate parent to a ton of kids that aren't mine, kids that I never even asked for, while everyone upstairs gossips about what a bad, baby killing guy I am. As if I don't already have enough on my plate!
Oh, and trust me, whenever I find out which one of these degenerates started the rumor that I crave ""the blood of the innocent"" and ""bathe in the blood of the unborn,"" he or she is headed straight to Malebolge. Honestly, as if everyone down here doesn't already know that I bathe in mineral water. ""Blood of the unborn,"" yeah right. Not with these sensitive pores.
Well here I go, officially setting the record straight: remove baby sacrifice from the satanic agenda. I do not want it, I never wanted it, please stop.
I'm at my wits end. I work day in and day out looking after all these infants, and for what? A reputation for being a big ol'jerk?
For evil's sake, I'm doing the best I can. If I ever come across as mean, cut me some slack. As a single father of 250,000, I think I'm entitled to being a little cranky once in a while.",0
"""Today, meine students, you will learn how to arouse a subject with a charm spell of Dominis Vinco"" said venerated but deeply respected Helga von Taurgum, the mistress of Darkness, while she walked in her tight dark clothes around her subjects in class, the venerated Mistress was well suited for her age of barely passed forty and her hips kept intentionally moving in manner of teasing the barely maturing males and females of the great academy of the Magical Bondage.
""Ah, young Asswulf"" she suddenly turned to sixteen year old blonde and a bit chubby teenager, whom quickly dropped his head in shame when he looked into the youngish face of the Mistress and her brown eyes that seemed childish, but felt the joys of life that gave great wisdom to her ""why you and miss Titeria do not try a small practice.""
Asswulf turned to his comrade in bondage, Titeria, whom wild curly red hair was containable only by the leather strap on her head that kept it in check of bursting wildly.
""Wh.. what if I do something wrong? What if I cause pain or something...worse?"" said Asswulf with uncertainty the size a building block.
""Oh, sweet, sweet, Asswulf"" said Mistress and like a shadow came elegantly right behind him ""I am here for you to keep you and your comrade safe"" she said elegantly, while putting her hand with long fingers and black nails onto his shoulder and said in commanding tone ""pick up your whip.""
Asswulf picked up his whip, just like all the whips that represented the Id of their Maister Kommandant, so was his represented in a manner that symbolized his inner self, a bit short but very fat whip that when used produced the arcane powers dormant inside each wielder that splashed in waves onto the friends and foes alike.
The Mistress stud behind Asswulf and her hand went from his shoulder onto the palm of his hand where he held his fat whip. Asswulf felt her warm breath and her female curves that pressed onto his back, meaty and big curves of maternal heritage that any man would lay with.
Titeria came with commanding step right in front of him, her young and still developing body in black robes of night similar to the Mistress but yet without the curves of maternal beauty.
""I am waiting meine camarade in bondage"" said to now utterly confused Asswulf.
""I...I am not ready"" said Asswulf while the Mistress gently picked up his palm with whip.
""Fear not meine little student, 'zer is no big bad wolves in dis class"" said Mistress, her german accent begun to appear like the SS legions before Poland.

"My 11 year old son is really into writing. He whipped this up (I have not read it yet)
I walked out of my containment pod in the morning, and the fluorescent lights blinded me for a few seconds. A few scientists rushed down when they heard the seal in my pod release. Mist flowed from the pod and drifted into the lab. Different scientists monitored and checked the artificial organisms in my body with an X-ray. I hated having to sit in that pod for at least two hours per day, constantly being pestered and monitored before I could even leave the depths of the lab. It was uncomfortable and hot in the X-ray pod. After being released from the pod I walked upstairs in my jumpsuit, itchy and annoyed. It was too tight in my suit, but I knew better than to complain. Before leaving, I snatched a cellphone from my pod that I hid there. I stole the cellphone two weeks ago from father, but he had so many it was barely noticeable. I had been chatting with people online for days now, and they were quite nice. I wish to meet real humans other than the scientists and servants in the manor. I made sure to use the cellphone discreetly when my father wasn't forcing me to sit in diagnostic chambers to make sure I'm perfectly healthy, or making me learn how to lie to reporters and manage a company. I understood it was dangerous to steal things from father, and that he was only doing this for my benefit, and that this was for my own good. Right? Right. I thought so. I continued through the maze of corridors to find that my father was having a heated debate with someone on the phone. I waited patiently, like I was supposed to, and then we begun our classes. I sat impatiently, having occasional spasms. Not because I was unhealthy, the exact opposite. It was because I didn't want to be here. I had no choice in the matter, I was aware of this. So I sat dutifully and waited. After ranting for what seemed to be hours, but was only thirty minutes, I was excused to go to my next class. Just before I got up, I asked, ""Father, may I leave the manor?"" My words were like glass that were just dropped and silence overwhelmed the room. He looked furious, veins bulging from his neck. ""No,"" he said in a calm voice, but it reeked of anger. ""You may not. Is something wrong? This is the first time you have asked this. Maybe you should go back to the lab."" He said with authority. I sat up. I clutched the table to support my weight, which seemed to grow until my legs barely stood up on their own. ""… No,"" I said. ""Excuse me?"" He bellowed, not even bothering to seem calm anymore. ""How dare you defy me!"" He yelled, and he walked towards me. He didn't stand a chance. Life went by in flashes, and soon he was on the ground and I was running out of the manor. I sprinted out of the doors and I saw it all. The birds, the sky, the sunlight on my face. I ran. I ran as far as my legs could take me, the machines inside of me moving like clockwork. I was running away from the place that kept me prison. I was no longer afraid.",0
"2 nights in a row the Elf wasn't where I left it. Somebody's lying to me and I hate that. A family's all about trust. I'm not cool with being lied to not even for a joke. Besides it's not funny.
Nobody's moving it tonight he's in jail. I unscrewed the vent in the living room on the wall and put him in there. Kids couldn't be quiet enough to get a ladder to climb up and remove the vent guard. I'd wake up. Wife wouldn't know where to find a screwdriver. She wouldn't go through all that trouble just for a prank anyway.
[Next Morning]
Not again. Where's the little asshole at? I'm just going to act like it's not bothering me. They love to see me upset. I'm not giving them the satisfaction this time.
""Dad where's Melvin?"" says Eric (son).
""You or your mom would know."" I say.
[2 days pass]
Me: ""Honey, I'm pissed at you. What've you been doing on the roof? You don't need to be climbing around on the roof. You could get seriously hurt?""
(Jenna) Wife: ""What are you talking about?""
Me: ""Melvin the freakin Elf on the Shelf. He's on the roof!""
Wife: ""I've not been on the roof!""
Me: ""Where's Eric?""
Wife: ""Backyard""
[We both go to the backyard]
Eric swore it wasn't him and I half-believe him. Me and my wife told him how dangerous it was. We made him cry. He still swears it wasn't him. Is there a chance he's right? Maybe whichever one of us is doing it can't remember. Maybe sombody's sleepwalking. I used to when I was young but grew out of it. At least I thought. Eric was my age when I was sleepwalking. Jenna takes Ambien sometimes. Could be any of us 3. I've got to know. Time to buy a security camera.
[Security camera set to record. Elf sitting on kitchen table]
Ok time to review the footage. Elf just sitting there sitting there. Skip. Fast forward. Fast forward. The Elf stands up! He's like a little tiny robot walking. Holy Shit! He's floating around. I'm living Paranormal Activity 6!
I've calmed down now that I've got me, Jenna, and Eric in a hotel. I've never belived in the supernatural but demon possession/haunting now seems plausible. I'm going to put this on Youtube and ask for advice.
[Next Morning]
Phone rings. Unknown Atlanta number. What the hell I'll answer it.
Me: ""Hello.""
Lady: ""Is this Mr. Schmidt?""
Me: ""Yea""
Lady: ""Hi I'm Laura from Elf on the Shelf. We believe we've accidentally sold you a prototype Elf on the Shelf. We're experimenting with a new model that hides itself.""",0
"The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth. Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room, gazing at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them. They'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet's bounty had come. He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture. Beside him, his second barked out the orders. All around him, subordinates scurried around, beginning the assault. Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons. The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere. The acid would vaporize, but then, when it rained, it would rain acid. All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient.
Hatu was not _this_ patient. They'd been raining acid on the planet for weeks. Still the planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come and beg mercy. He'd been told kings would beg to give him water and algae. That he could plunder their lands to his fill. Why did the humans not cry for succor?
A subordinate bowed low before him. Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed.
""Sir,"" the subordinate said, shaking in fear but admirably keeping the tremor out of his voice, ""our attack is failing. We are running low on ammunition.""
""What!"" Hatu roared. There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice. ""How is this possible?""
The subordinate looked down now, too cowed to meet Hatu's eyes. Hatu glowered at him. ""You will answer my question, scum.""
""Sir,"" the subordinate said, voice barely above a whisper, ""the earthlings. They-they appear to be…they appear to be drinking our poison.""
""In fact, many people have been collecting it in large urns,"" another voice piped up somewhere behind him.
Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him, looking to him for guidance, but all he could think was, ""If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans, if they could so boldly drink that, what use was any of their weapons?""",0
"""Fuck!!!!!""
""Damnit Zolfak, what is it now?""
""I found another one!!!!""
""Are you seriously watching the terran films again? I thought I told you to lay off that shit when we are working.""
""I just wanted to get a couple in. We were in hyperspace for the past few seconds so I just thought a one or two wouldn't hurt...""
""We are here to stop GL-567 from going supernova. We did not come all the way out to the middle of nowhere to watch the terran films. That's what our Quad-Pod 4000 viewing stations at home are for.""
""Yeah yeah, I know. But, Grimlo, dude, just check out how bad this one is. You know you love the movies too....""
""No""
""Grimlo......""
""No...""
Grimmmmllooooo""
""Fine!""
""Okay, so, you know the one that's been on the Array waiting list for the past 40 delquads?""
""Yeah, a Toy Story or something, right?""
""Yes, that's the one. I have a memory copy of it right here....""
""Zolfak!!!! What the hell are you thinking? Do you know what could happen if you get caught with Toy Story on your neurochip?""
""I just couldn't wait. I had to see it....""
""Okay, well, just project it from you brooktalk - and speed it up to 5 delmomicrons. I'm not touching that shit with a 6 perawat polstak.""
""Fine fine sissy pants - I'll explain while you watch. So, you know how the premise showed that the humans don't know the toys are real?""
""Yeah....""
""And that they play dead whenever the humans are around?""
""Yeah.......""
""Well, see here - the character Buzz Lightyear walks in and doesn't realize he's a toy. It takes him forever to realize that he isn't a real spaceman, and is, in fact, a toy like the rest of them.""
""So what are you getting at?""
""DON'T YOU REMEMBER???!!!! At the beginning of the movie when Andy walks in, Buzz Lightyear fakes dead like the rest of the toys!!!! If he thought he was a real spaceman, he wouldn't have faked dead!!!!""
""My god.....""
""SEEEEEEEEEEEE, I TOLD YOU!""
""The Broikarks are going to flip a shit when they see this....""

"Oh, off the port side
We spotted the shore
A place full of dragons
and treasures galore
But our excitement soon faded
When off of the rise
Came trundling three women
Of monstrous size
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
The eldest was Gladys
With cutlass in hand
Hands that had often
Strewn blood on the sand
A woman of violence
A maiden of gore
She made sure that none
Stood long on the shore
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
Next, came fair Ingrid
A beauty for sure
With hair so golden
And skin smooth and pure
But make no advance
It shouldn't be missed
That this bonny lass
Has brawler's fists
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?
Last there was Hilda
A sight to behold
Covered in mud
From her head to her toes
But strangest of all
She brandishes trees
To help her fling sailors
Back to the sea
*Chorus*
Yo Ho! Raise your swords!
Three hellish lasses be runnin'these shores.
The island holds dragons and treasures galore.
But what does a dragon need guardin'for?",0
"Angel sips at her tea, leaning against one of the posts for the deck's roof. The steam drifts straight upward with stillness of the humid air. The incoming storm rumbles in the distance, the air itself crackling with energy and anticipation. As she looks out across the trees and bushes in her front yard, the leaves have been turned upwards, the plants eager for the rain after a week of broiling hot weather.
The tea's scent of raspberry drifts along, the scent of rain heavy in the air and another rumble of thunder, much closer, comes from the billowing clouds. Angel looks upward more, taking another sip off of the clear mug. A bolt of lightning streaks across the darkening sky and she counts.
""One one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thou—"" The crack of thunder cuts her off and she takes a sip from her mug. ""Three miles."" Another bolt flashes and there's the immediate sound of thunder, not even allowing a ‘ one'from her lips. She sips more at her tea, watching and waiting as the sky grows heavy.
There is no rain yet, just the promise of it on a stiff breeze that finds itself blowing. The sycamore trees bend and sway, dancing as more lightning flashes across the sky. Angel sniffs the air, smelling the rain incoming and looks up again. More lightning, more thunder, and the wind begins to pick up. Even the holly tree bends this time and the gust picks her short hair up and throws it crosswise across her head.
Another sip of her tea, shaking her head to return her hair to its normal position. The clouds billow higher, the sky changing colors and becoming greener and a sense of unease threads through her. The weather was so unpredictable around here but she just had to see. Jessica said that it was beautiful. Angel drinks more, looking up again, waiting for the rain. There's a deafening crack of lightning and thunder, startling her and making her draw back under the porch further in fright.
And then the rain starts. It's large, plopping drops, thick in the air and dropping straight downwards at first. Each drop glimmers as if it has its own little internal light. Angel watches in fascination. She had always loved storms but this new event, the rain shimmering, it made the storms that rolled through absolutely hypnotizing. They even shimmer after hitting the ground for a couple of seconds.
A streak of lightning lights up the sky, the rumble of thunder immediately following it. Each drop of water outputs a rainbow in the flashes of lightning, the electricity in the air setting her hair standing straight up. A flash sends a streak of rainbow across the sky and ground, changing the color the grass with each new streak of light. The wind picks up, sending the rain down at a new angle with each gust.
The trees dance in the wind, rainbow patterns flashing on and off of their leaves and trunks with each strike of lightning and deafening roar of thunder. The gusts of wind make the rainbows twist and transform before her eyes, brightening the green light into all colors. Each flash gives a new picture, a new image that isn't ever the same as the one before. The yard has been transformed into a wonderland of pure colors and lights.
Angel sits where she's been standing, staring blankly out at the sight in front of her, not sure if her legs can keep holding her up. Jessica had been right. It is absolutely beautiful.",0
"The walk up the driveway is as long and boring as usual. *This is why people have short driveways, * I think to myself, as I finally jog up the steps to my front door. After fumbling with the locks for few moments I enter inside, and smell the familiar scents of home. It always reminds me of Lucy, and it always makes me wonder when she's coming back.
*Is she coming back? *
I shake the thought away as best I can and throw my coat up on a hook before I head down the hallway, past the kitchen and into my study. I'm practically *dreaming* of the butter biscuits I have saved from yesterday, but they'll have to wait. If I don't get this report filed, I'm in deep trouble.
The air is stale in my study, which isn't a great thing. I've been falling steadily behind ever since Lucy left, and I haven't been committing as many hours to work as I should be. Then again, maybe that's why she left me. *John* probably doesn't have a full time job. I bet *John* just vacations 5 days a week on Lucy's dime. The money I won her in the lawsuit is definitely enough to cover that for a few years.
*Could you stop thinking about her for one goddamned second? *
I shake my head again, and decide the butter biscuits are becoming more of a necessity for me than anything else right now. So I drop my work bag off at the desk and walk around the corner into my kitchen, where I stop short as all thoughts of butter biscuits fly from my mind.
There's a white grand piano.
In my kitchen.
There wasn't one before. But now there's a white grand piano in my kitchen nook, right where my table used to be.
""What the fuck,"" I say aloud.",0
"I wake up at my desk. My stapler is gone. Somebody took it.
Who am I?
There's a note.
'I didn't want to interrupt your nap but I took your stapler. I'll have it back soon, or you can come get it if you need it""
There's no signature.
I walk through the aisles in the cubicles. Who are these people. They nod at me? Do they know me?
Do I know them?
I see desks without staplers. Did someone take their staplers too?
Someone is preying on staplers.
I will find it. I'll have it back.
Someone walks by.
""Have you seen my stapler?""
""Uhm no""
My stapler could be anywhere.
I come back to my cubicle. My stapler is still gone. There's something different about my cubicle.
While I was gone someone lined with paper, drawings all over. A man with a weird tie, a boss with pointy hair.
There's a sign.
It says 'they took my swing line' under a picture of a red stapler.
Someone's taunting me.
""Uhm, what are you doing in my cubicle?""
A voice behind me. I turn around. He looks just like me.
Well he's white and thirty and wearing a shirt and tie.
We're actually pretty different now that I think about it.
""Sorry"" I say.
This mad man is affecting all of us.
Where is my cubicle? I wander until I recognize the scenery. My stapler is back. I look up.
Someone's walking away from cubicle. I can't see there face.
I run after them.
They walk into an office. Try to shut the door. I don't know if I'll make it in time.
I burst through the door.
""Oh hey, Bob"" says the man at the desk.
I think his name is Larry.
""I put the stapler back in the right cubicle right. I stare at him. He flaunts it in my face.
""Did you uh…did you need something""
I keep staring. He has to break soon.
""If this is about me catching you napping we actually encourage short naps. You can use the break room if you want, just uh…just don't abuse it""
This man is a sociopath.
""Yeah I don't mean to be rude but if there's nothing else I'm kind of busy so…""
I leave, go back to my cubicle.
My staplers gone again.
There's another note.
""Sorry, you were away, needed your stapler for a sec. Come get it if you need""
There's a name.
Frank.",0
"'How long have you lived?' The reporter asks. She's pretty, in a plain sort of way; doesn't wear any makeup, and doesn't really need to.
'I don't know' I smiled, it was a question that I'd been asked almost everyday this past week. Who knew revealing my immortality to the world would generate so many questions.
'You don't know? As in you've forgotten?' She asks.
'As in, I can't remember, although I'd wager at maybe four thousand years, give or take' I say.
'And why do you think that?' She sits forward, pen to paper.
I think for a second, 'One of my earliest memories puts me in Ancient Greece, but it was before civilisation had really gotten a hold; the temples were still being built' I shrug, 'but...I don't know, I'm really not sure.'
'You're Greek?' She says, her eyes move from my feet to my head, examining my hair, skin colour, and eyes. I laugh.
'Maybe'
'So you don't remember where you were born?' She says.
'Do you?' I arch my eyebrow.
'I suppose not, but I remember what I've been told' she says.
'And I was told thousands of years ago; do you think you could remember after all of that time?'
She pauses, 'Probably not'.
'Well, there's your answer'.
She shuffles through her notes, 'what about recent events? It says here you fought in the American civil war?'
'Was that a question?'
'Yes, did you?'
'I don't know, where did you get that information?' I ask.
'One of your journals, it was uncovered last year' she explains, confused, as if I should already know.
'Ah, I see. I remember loosing a couple of those' I laugh, 'although there was this fire, in some English city, hell it might have been the fire of London,' she's looks as though she's about to ask a question, 'But I can't remember the year' and she goes back to writing, 'I lost nearly every journal, and the few that remained were barely legible. In fact the only one the I could understand turned out to just be about a ship journey I took fifty years earlier' I begin to laugh, as if I've told a joke, but all I receive is a blank expression.
'I guess you had to be there' I smirk.
'Maybe' she says, 'what about world war 2? It's well documented you fought there, a sergeant in the British army right?'
My smile fades, 'Yes I...Fought'.
'Sorry, it can't have been too long ago for you. Do you need some water? Can we get him a drink please' she shouts to an assistant.
'No, please, it's fine, I just...A lot of good men died, many of whom have recently been put to rest' I say. 'I lost a lot of friends'
'I apologise, we can move on if you'd like?' She's good at lying.
'That would be nice' I say.",0
"The bright sunlight burned my skin, in the few places where it was exposed. The ocean was, as usual, totally smooth.
The only movement was the fins of some Greywhales breaking through the surface, but they were so far away that it was difficult to distinguish anything more.
The soft wind caressed my skin, and the plume on my Protector of the Holy Ground hat swung slowly sending red flashes all around. The shadow of my spear was clear on the stairs, and it made me feel safe. Not that I would ever have to use it, obviously, but eh.
I liked it here. It was...calm. So different from...other places.
I planted the spear in the sand, and lay on the sand, arms behind my head, looking at the sky. In the silence, I fell asleep.
---
And then I woke up. A strong wind was whitening the ocean, and lifting droplets of salt water that constantly hit my face. The once blue sky was dark grey, and suffocatingly low.
This could mean only one thing: the Beast was coming. The creature I dreaded the most had awoken from its slumber. I had to find shelter.
The wind so strong that the boat had been brought on the beach, I started walking toward the shack. But it was too late.
A terrible voice called my name, so loud it overcame the wind. ""STHEPEN MACLAKIN! You had a duty! You had sworn to carry it out!""
Terrified, I started running towards the building, my heart racing and pounding, under the pouring rain. As soon as I opened the door, a gush of wind slammed it shut.
The voice continued, shattering the skies: ""I told you to DO THE DISHES!"" said the Beast, with voice of thunder.
""But MOOOOM. I don't wanna! Five more minutes, PLEEEAAASEEEEE!"" I implored, hopeful. But no, the island started melting away, and the reality of the projecting room filled the empty skies and the clear ocean. ""Do it NOW"" she screamed, from the door now ajar.
I already missed my island",0
"""...You have no magical powers, kid. I already fucking told you twice that somebody made a mistake. This type of shit happens all the time, it's really not that big a deal.""

I gots all the magic right here in his fucking wand."" Jerry pulled a twig looking stick of a wand from inside in coat pocket. ""Kid, that's not even a fucking wand, did you rip that off one of those oak tress outside?"" ""Maybe, but it's none of your fucking business, Bitch.

"""Who can replace Death? He was the most feared of us all. Without Death there can be no reckoning upon the sinful mortals.""
War scratched his thinning beard. He was running out of options. No others had dared to take up such a heavy burden. While War was no stranger to the horrors of, he shuddered to think about the atrocities that Death had committed. Was there any being in the 7 realms to take up the Cloak and Scythe?
""But there is someone."" hissed Famine.
""Brothers you are aware that all the atrocities we have committed were dealt by Man. War, death, famine and conquest. These were all Man's undoing. Who else better to don the burden of Death then a man himself?""
Famine's ragged hood covered his face, only showing his decaying mouth twisted in a sick smile.
Conquest was quick to challenge.
""Man, donning the very bane of his existence? Brother, your imprudence will be the end of us all. A mortal man is hideous creature. He is greedy, selfish and cruel. Giving one this much power will only result in abuse.""
""Conquest, you are as foolish as ever. Have you learnt nothing from Death? He was the wisest of us all, he-""
""If Death was so wise, explain his abrupt departure. Why did he leave his duties behind? We are the horsemen of the apocalypse; both terrible and glorious. When the Horn of the Heavens sounds we will charge and strike fear into the hearts of sinners. It is who we are. Death was a fool for leaving.""
""ENOUGH!""
War slammed into Conquest, knocking him down to the brimstone. He unleashed an onslaught of blows onto his golden armor until it was dented beyond recognition. Breathless, War stood up towering over his foe and boomed.
""I will not take this insolence. Death was the best of us. I loved him as a brother and a mentor.""
War's stone face softened for a second.
""Should you be stupid enough to blaspheme our brother again, I will end you.""
Conquest nodded in shame. He was not used to the bitter taste of defeat. He silently vowed that War would pay for the humiliation he suffered.
""Famine. You say that a mortal can replace Death. Bring him to me.""
""As you wish brother.""",0
"Holy shit trains,
Trains for days,
My Scale Electric,
Rail way.
It had tunnels and turns,
And signals and sound.

Around and around.

Made up for it all.

"Sometimes I hate my job.
Oh, the work itself isn't bad, it's the travel. By now, I've probably got enough frequent flyer miles to spend the rest of my life in the sky. Yeah, right. As if my job would give me the time off. As if I had the money to do anything else. Jetsetting around the world for the biggest concern around, it ought to be glamorous, right?
Nope.
God, I feel like an ass. I ought to be grateful. I've seen most all of the great wonders of the world. I've been to pretty much every tourist trap there is, and all on the company dime. I've seen and done things that most people wouldn't even believe. So why does my life feel so empty?
Because I made it empty.
And there it was. The truth I'd been trying this whole flight not to think. That I did this to myself. I'd left my friends behind, a long time ago. Now, my life was filled with co-workers, associates, clients. I had done it to myself.
I wasn't there when my son was born. I chose the job. I wasn't there for most of his childhood, other than cleaning up after his pets. I hadn't even seen him since his mother died. His mother. Not my wife, though she had been. I'd let that relationship die too. The boy was living with her parents now.
I was supposed to see him today. What would he say? Would he even recognize me? Would he be angry at me for not being there? What would I say?
Would he be angry at me? I still didn't even know if I was angry at me.
But we've arrived, and it's time for me to meet the son I barely knew.
I see him there, waiting for me. I see him looking for me. He's not scowling. That's something, at least.
""Son.""
""Dad.""
We look at each other for a small eternity, not quite sure how to proceed. If I stop now, I won't be able to go through with this, so I muster the courage to speak.
""You know I'm sorry about your mother.""
Crap. That wasn't what I meant to say.
""Yeah, Dad. I know.""
""You saw?""
""Yeah. I saw.""
""It's time, son.""
He draws back. ""Me?""
""You've seen how it works. You're my son, you can do this. Take my hand.""
He takes my hand, and I go limp. I fall against him, sliding to the floor, but he's still holding me. He guides me to the other side, just like he saw me do with his mother. Just like I've done so many times.
And I'm finally free.",0
"""I was wrong? The whole time?""
**No. I am a God. I am not your God. But your God is not nothing. **
""I'm afraid I don't understand at all.""
**Not many do. Humans have the unfortunate tendency of assuming answers are linear, or very straight forward. **
""Can you please explain all this to me? I'm sure you're very busy, but since we're here anyway...”
**Very well. Monotheism is a strange way of religion. It's something that none of us ever encouraged or made, but so it is. The entirety of the universe, and all of the others, made by one measly God? No, we are powerful, but not of that magnitude. **
""You mean that everything, all of this, was a collaboration?""
**Certainly. We do not tend to disagree as often as humans do. It was not so difficult to decide the laws of physics and create beings. **
""You're telling me that every deity from every religion lives together on some unknown plane like roommates? That the polytheists are right?""
**The polytheists have a broader view than many. They recognize that power is not held within one entity. Yet they could not possibly understand the amount of forces who shape their world. **
**As for the ""roommate"" situation, I don't believe you're looking at this correctly. Many call me Shiva. I was not created Shiva. I have always been a force within the universe, one without a name. Humans created our names. **
""So gods are products of our imagination?""
**No. The image we have is one humans created for us. I am no less of a force if humans do not look at me and call me a name, as they do not look at many of my kind. We simply are, always have been, and always will be. **
""I'm afraid this is all going over my head.""

"""Throw that garbage out! Right now!""
Jackson flinched as the words were barked by his superior, but hastily grabbed up the sketches he has lain on his boss's desk mere moments ago.
""Are-are you sure he won't work as a character?"" Jackson asked again, finding that his voice was growing thinner the more his boss's eyes furrowed.
""Throw it out, Jackson,"" the voice came out a bitter hiss, a darkness emanating from behind the mahogany desk. ""Throw it out, or it's your job that's in the garbage.""
Jackson nodded and quickly took off, dashing out of the office and back to his drawing desk.
He took one more sorrowed look at the sketch in his hands before sighing, feeding the leaves of paper into the shredder. He should have known not to show it to his boss. The artists around him had all complained about how offensive it was and that if that was the best Jackson could think of, he might as well turn in his resignation and burn his desk.

""H-how do you know my name?""
""That's not the point, James. The point is, you need to win Sarah back! Screw, Tom! He doesn't deserve her!""
""But, Sarah made it clear that-""
Mary raised her hand and backhanded James. ""Are you going to let *Sarah* decide for herself?! She obviously doesn't know what's best!""
James looked at his hands. Who was this stranger that weirdly knew details abou his life? *Maybe I should go to the police*, he thought. On the other hand, she *was* right. Sarah didn't know what was right for herself. Heck, she couldn't even choose who the correct husband would be! A hardworking man like James or a deadbeat loser like Tom!
""I can't believe I'm taking advice from a 13 year old. "", James said.
Mary looked up at the 30 year old me. ""Now, go get your Sarah back.""",0
"It's kind of a dick move that they sent me alone.
Not complaining. Mr. Alien Overlord said they only needed one guy. Mr. President asked Mr. General to recommend
a Mr. Best-Marine-In-The-Army. Mr. General recommended Mr. Myself here.
So they stuck Mr. Myself here on a rocket and shipped me off to the Andromeda Galaxy.
""Relax,"" Mr. Alien Overlord had said, ""It'll be fine.""
They gave me a small device like an iPod with a single button for a display and said, ""That is our technology. You don't press the button until you watch the instructional video.""
""Where's the instructional video?""
""We'll send it to you when it's time.""
Yeah. Ok. Of course I'll do it. Racist aliens that want to eliminate every other species in the galaxy? Yeah, I'll help
you fight them. Yeah, I trust that this box with a button will help me defeat a planet. Yeah, you got it under
control.
But now I'm getting closer to the planet. And no instructions. Nothing.
Dick move. For real.
I check through the windshield outside – the planet is red, and it's growing closer.
What do I do if I get there and there's no instructions? Ask for directions? Tell them I'm lost? Join them and become an intergalactic racist so I don't die?
I pull the button-device from my pocket and study it. I've contemplated pressing the damn thing like a hundred times in the week it took for me to get here.
But they told me to wait. They told me to wait, so I'm waiting. The dicks.
""Identify yourself,"" comes a voice through my speakers.
Shit.
I look down at the button again.
""Identify yourself now or we will open fire.""
They see me. No more time. Crap.
I hover my hand over the button.
I hear the Overlord Alien's voice, back at the meeting on Earth: ""*It is essential that you wait for instructions before pressing the button*.""
""This is your last warning. Identify yourself or we will –""
The voice dies away in a hiss, like a radio switching between stations. I look up and my windshield is taken over by
the Alien Overlord's face.
""Hello, Mr. Austin,"" the video starts. ""Thank you for waiting for the instructions before pressing the button.""
""How did you know I didn't press the –""
""A quick overview, before we talk more about the device you carry with you – our species has recently found out
that the universe we all live in is – in fact – a simulation.""
""What?"" I ask, like the video can hear me.
""After some debating, we decided that this didn't really matter, since we had no way of getting out of the
simulation. So we carried on with our lives.""
""Well, that does make sense…""
""Like all simulations, however… Universe has some… glitches. Bugs you can exploit, if you get access to the source code.""
I look down at the button again.
""That is all you need to know. Please use the device in your possession with responsibility, and return it to us once
you've finished your mission. Best of luck and… have fun.""
The Overlord disappears, and my windshield goes back to reflecting the red planet, where a bunch of black ships are now hovering in front of it, their laser guns pointed my way.
""Ready to open fire!"" comes the voice again.
The button looks up at me, and I look down at it.
""Fuck it,"" I say, pressing down on it.
A screen rises from the device like a hologram, flashing in blue. A menu.
***CHEATS***
*INFINITE LIFE*
*INFINITE AMMO*
*EXPLOSIVE BULLETS*
*GIANTS HEADS*
*ALL WEAPONS*
*SUMMON MR. MEESEEKS*
*ARMOR UP*
*LIFE UP*
In slow motion, I look from the menu to the windshield, where more and more ships gather around me.
""Open fire!"" comes the voice, and the laser guns shift my way.
""Oh, this is going to be fun,"" I say, feeling a smile creeping into my face as I press the first option on the menu.",0
"They tell us that the darkness is feared simply because it is unknown. That may have fooled me when I was young but now I think I know better. They told us never to go near the place where the darkness resides, but I saw someone go there the other night. I followed. Along the winding path, I could only hear the leaves rustle and my own faint footsteps. Ahead of me was the figure, walking briskly down the path.
I flicked on my dim flashlight and kept it pointed on the ground. I defeated the darkness before me with the light. It closed itself around me, embracing me in a chilled choke-hold. I suddenly got the screaming urge to turn around. I should have. Whomever I was following has disappeared from my sight, another victim enveloped by the darkness. How scarcely we learn from our mistakes.
I don't know how I got home but when I awoke, but it was dark. I rushed to flip my lightswitch to once again defeat the darkness. There was a note pinned to my door, confirming my suspicion that someone brought me here. It simply read ""Don't"". And I won't. The elders were right.",0
"Simon kicked at the dirt nervously as he worked up the courage to speak. ""A-ahem. Umm. Well that escalated quite, ummm, q-quickly."" Simon stole a quick glance around and saw mostly downcast glances and a few quick nods.
Simon paused before continuing. He decided it best not recount the hell that they all lived through. Simon didn't have to be a religious man to realize that they had all just survived the apocalypse.
He wasn't eager to relive the showers of blood and screams of agony as nearly everyone around him met their grim demise. It was so horrifying that he even felt a pang of sympathy shoot through his fear as his workplace bully, Andy, was sucked into the fiery pits of hell.
He now found himself in a vast field surrounded by people as shell shocked as himself.
However, as he surveyed them for the first time, he began to find comfort. Beyond their masks of fear he saw kindred spirits. He knew just by their demeanor that, like him, they were the beaten down, the unassuming, the ignored, the bullied, the kind hearted, the taken for granted. The meek, he realized. And they had inherited the earth.
""Y-yeah. Soooo. I guess we should, umm, do some stuff.""
A few more subtle nods.",0
"**NOTE: ** I have barely any knowledge whatsoever of the workings of the human genome. Do not accept *anything* said here as fact regarding the human genome, although certain individual parts may be correct.
---
There have always been portions of the human genome that don't seem to actually affect anything. A few years back, when the bill that allowed gene modification on fertilized human embryos was passed, several other geneticists and I went *crazy* changing these. It didn't seem to do a thing. Even if we put *random* data in those ""cruft"" (as we called them) parts, the people would turn out the same. But recently, I had noticed something interesting. Since I used to be a computer scientist, before I became a geneticist, the way I look at things is sometimes very different from that of my colleagues, and recently I had started comparing different people's genomes. What's the difference between the genome of a tall, white, blonde, blue-eyed white woman, and a short, dark-haired, brown-eyed black man? Again and again, every time, only one thing was consistent between *everyone*. The cruft. So I logged into the international database of human genetics and used up all of my queries for the year (it's kind of sickening, actually: there's a set limit on the number of queries you can make per year to the website, and then it's based off of microtransactions) comparing the cruft on 16,774 different human genomes. All the same. Perhaps it was just coincidence, but I had to be sure. I loaded up the entirety of the cruft into one file, and looked at it. It looked...normal. Random. It looked like DNA. Then, by a sudden sudden burst of inspiration, I ran a reverse-base4 one it. The resultant file was, apparently, a standards-compliant ISO file? That didn't sound right. I mounted it and looked inside. There was a single file, named `README.txt`, and a single folder, named `src/`. What the hell was this witchcraft?

NAME
dna — compiles.and files to usable genomes
SYNOPSIS
dna [-adho] [-t | -w] [-L linkpath] [-O outputdevice]
[-m arch [: machine]] [-p [eprtv]] filename...
DESCRIPTION
The dna compiler will, given a creation-dev-ice of at least version 2.7.4, compile a
genome from one or multiple.and files and use the creation-dev-ice to bootstrap any
number of ""starter"" animals.
BUGS
No known bugs
COPYRIGHT
This compiler and man page are copyright (c) 0-∞ A.D under the HPL (Holy Public
Licence), Jehova & Baelzebub enterprises, LTD., in cooperation with RedHat
software LLC.
Huh. I looked inside `src/`, which contained the source code to this ""dna"" program, and according to the parser...a ""creation-dev-ice"" was identical to one of our modern 3-D printers!
I knew it was expensive, and I was just a poor lab-worker, but I didn't care. I had to try this software out. I shelled out for the most expensive 3-D printer I could find, hooked it up to my computer, and ran the dna program on `example.and`, in `src/`. It gave me various messages as it ran, and eventually the 3-D printer started up. And it was *loud*. I had tested it out a few times before, and it had been relatively loud, but not as loud as this. I didn't dare leave it alone long enough to go to the store and buy some ear plugs, but I desperately wanted to. My computer began to get visibly hot, despite being state-of-the-art liquid-nitrogen-cooled. I shielded my eyes and looked right at the bottom of the screen, where the indicator read 90% finished. Almost...almost...you can do it. Until two error messages showed up in bright red:
ERROR: Operating system is not TempleOS. Unable to link properly.
ERROR: Running temperature is not 98.549°F. Deforming product.
And what stepped out of the 3-D printer a few seconds a later is a monstrosity I will not bear to describe. Suffice to say it was the most awful, ferocious, disgusting beast known to mankind. With all the intelligence of a human, with none of the conscience; with all the ferociousness of the tiger, with none of the discretion. And five more such as these stepped out of the printer. I shrieked and ran.

"""It's about that time sugar."" the young waitress said to the man sitting across the marble counter from her.
Laying his fork down onto the white folded napkin he inquired, ""Time for what, hopefully my check."" he chuckled to himself.
""You havent heard of her? The lady from uptown who walks down here everday."" she said twisting her hair, leaning on her right arm.
She was referring to the humble, pile of a lady who strolled their rural town everyday. Hunching over a wooden cane, she frequented the businesses on the main drag here. At the shops, always looking and touching everything, at the restaurants ordering her food. Never touches the served meal. Barb was what everyone knew her by.
""You mean that ol' bag that drifts down these streets, with white long hair?"" pointing towards the window. ""I heard that lady used to have quite a bit of money."" he stated.
""Ya thats her...and that's her famous rumor."" the waitress said twisting a red gloss smeared smile. ""Oh look there she is now."" she quickly said whispering to the man.
The handle on the front door turned and pushed out, and a short statured woman, hunched over, strode slowly through the door. Wearing a red knit hat that looked homemade, her white hair curled out into tiny half-circles around the brim.She wore an emotionless face.
Quietly at the counter the man begins, ""I wonder what she is gonna order today Carla?""
""Oh, she always orders the same thing,"" stretching closer to his ear she whispers,"" A bowl of tomato soup.""
""Tomato soup?"" his eyes widen."" 59 cents at the grocery store, and she comes *here* and pays 4 dollars for it?""
""That's right sugar."" She said. ""Lemme go get her order real quick.""
She walks down the aisle to where the tired, return guest was sitting.
""What'll it be today barbie?"" pulling out her notepad and paper, already writing *tomato soup* on it.
The old women cleared her throat in a dirty gust, and began to speak. ""It's so hard to choose here! Everything looks good."" Running her finger down the page on the menu.
""Well you can have it all, if you got the money to do it."" she jokingly said. ""Maybe if we hit the lottery huh Barbie?""
""Ya maybe so."" barb mumbled. ""Well after a long thought about it, I think I'll go with the.."" pausing, ""tomato soup!""
""That sounds excellent dear."" Licking her finger, and walking towards the kitchen to ladel the soup out of the pot.
The man at the far end of the counter turned on his stool to face to lady a few seats away. ""Hey there barb."" he blurts, ""What did ya decide on?""
Raising her head and tilting it to see him, she answered, ""Well, I heard through the grapevine the cook here makes the best tomato soup!""
""You know,"" crossing his legs, ""That's what everyone always says. 'Guess you picked the right thing.""
The waitress returned with the steaming red soup, swaying in a white cup.
""Here ya go, hot off the presses."" As the she pushed the soup across the counter towards barb.
""Thank you miss.."" looking around distressed, ""but uh.. I'm gonna have to pass this evening.""
*She always does this* the waitress sullenly thought. *Why even go through the motion. *
The lady struggling to lift off the stool and stand, turned around and mumbled, ""I'm off to the nieces, you know how kids are...never can wait around.""
She limped towards the door, turned the knob and briskly left the restaurant.
""What was that all about?"" the man speaking down the counter.
""Oh you know, that's just how she is. Always orders, never even touches it though."" Placing the cup in the bin under the register.
Grabbing her the wet rag in the bucket on the lower shelf, she notices something out of the corner of her eye laying on the counter.
""Oh my i think she forgot something!"" worriedly she said.
She bent over to see what it was and noticed a gold bracelet laying on the table. A diamond in the middle of every connecting piece.
As she picked it up, a tag on the bracelet flopped over into her hand.
It read, *To carla, My beautiful daughter. You always used to love the Tomato soup i made for you. Thanks for returning the favor. *",0

"I stood in front of the bathroom sink and let the lukewarm water roll off my face and back into the sink. Without opening my eyes I reached for the hand towel and dried my face off. I had to get ready for my Chemistry midterm that was in two hours. The anxiety had been gripping me for the past two weeks, I had barely even talked to mom. This thought sent a sudden feeling of guilt to course through me. It was the anniversary of Ruth's death tomorrow. It was hard on Mom especially since she had raised us by herself without any help. She was never home working two jobs just to keep us fed, which is why she blamed herself so much when my little sister killed herself. I of course blamed myself too. I kept telling myself I should've been home sooner. I shouldn't have been goofing around playing video games with my friends. If only I was there I could've stopped her and prevented all of this.
The water spilling over the sink sent me back into reality. ""Shit...shit."" I swore before quickly turning off the tap. I ran a hand over my face in exhaustion and glanced into the mirror. At first I thought I was dreaming. There right in front of me, in the mirror was Ruth. Her black curly hair still in two tiny pigtails and her favourite Yoshi shirt, the one I bought her for Christmas. ""Ruth?"" my voice came out strained barely a whisper. She smiled innocently in response. I leaned in closer to the mirror and rubbed my eyes. She was still there to my surprise.
""Brother! Come on let's go play!"" She called to me her voice rehashing memories I wasn't aware I had forgotten. Hesitantly I placed my hand on the mirror I had seen horror movies, I didn't want to be that idiot but it was my sister.
My hand passed through, it felt like I stepping into a giant jello wall but I continued into the mirror anyway. Chemistry could wait, my sister could not.",0
"Hi. I'm Jim. I may just be a sapling at the moment but one day I want to be human. I see them running around, on legs and feet, flailing their arms, jumping, dancing; Free. They know how to stay warm, how to move no matter whether the sun is near or far. They breathe air. Oh, of course photosynthesis is close but every time I grow, it's a step towards being a part of Mother Plant. She's the one who makes the giant balls and sends them up to the sky; planets is what I heard a human call them. The planets are beautiful once they reach the nighttime sky, they shine to be the brightest stars. It's a big task The Mother has, to fill the nighttime sky with stars so beautiful they light the whole sky. But humans...well what can I say? They've chosen their own paths, each path being so different from another...I can't help thinking that maybe, just maybe I don't belong here. Maybe I can do more than make planets. Maybe I could dance and shout and...and...... RUN.",0
"""Overpopulation""
The man in the blue suit clicked a small remote in his hand and the screen filled with images of starving children, their eyes like rough marbles pushed not quite far enough into their heads, fantastic, horizon-filling cities that smoked and glowed like a dying fire, and, of course, the typical image of the Tokyo metro with passengers being crammed through the car doors by impassive uniformed men.
""It's reality. A horrible one. The time has come to rectify it, and the hour for half measures is past. We're in a position to possibly,"" The man in the blue suit paused, dipping his chin in a show of humility, ""save humanity from itself.""
The boardroom was silent. Smoke from various cigarettes and cigars drifted over the massive tabletop. Rain pattered on the window panes.
""Mental projection, physical control."" The man in the blue suit clicked his controller again, and now a video of a man walking appeared on the screen. Waves emanated from an unknown source and struck him. He stopped in his tracks.
""This is a rough draft of what every man, woman, and child on earth will see. We can tweak the language, of course."" Click.
The screen faded to black and a few crisp lines of text in a modern font appeared.
'Your free trial of Life has ended. Payment, in full, of one life must be completed within five minutes.'
The man in the blue suit clicked again. The screen flicked to a scene where the same man was now standing on a city street. He blinked his eyes, staring at the people around him. An old man sat on a bench, waiting for a bus. The original man's face became distraught. He stared at the old man, perhaps trying to judge just how old he was. His face changed, and his fist clenched. Suddenly, a man walking on the street behind the old man on the bench turned and wrapped his hands around the old man's throat. A car accelerated, jumping the curb and crushing several people against the wall of a building. A crash of glass was heard and the body of a woman fell down into the street, her head cracking open on the pavement.
The man in the blue suit clicked the button again, stopping the video.
""I think you get the idea. Total chaos for a few years. Maybe even a decade. But then we can rebuild- start over with the knowledge we should have had the first time. And the best part is-"" He leaned onto the table, looking at each of the attendees in turn. ""You all are exempt from the whole thing.""
There was a slight pause. A cough.
""All those in favor?""
A chorus of 'Aye'
""All those opposed?""
Silence.",0
"A news channel is showing grainy security footage. A middle-aged man in sweatpants pushes his way through the trendy outfits in a crowded bar. He gets up onto the counter and begins to shout.
""My name is Dale!""
""Hey Dale!"" a few patrons return his call, but most ignore him and continue
chatting away.
""My name is Dale!""
""Get the fuck down!"" the barkeep shouts.
Dale unzips his sweatshirt to reveal a bomb. A few rush for the door.
""And I'm an alcoholic!""
The video abruptly stops and cuts to a news anchor.
""A tremendous act of violence last night kills fifty four at Dionysus, a new bar at Times Square. Alcoholics Anonymous claims responsibility for what experts are calling an act of terrorism. The group's spokesman had this to say…""
Cut to what looks like a torch-lit dungeon. A group of men and women wearing barrels on their heads with holes for eyes stand behind a single man, who is also wearing a barrel. The man steps up to a microphone.
""People have become powerless over alcohol, and society has become unmanageable. Until alcohol is forever banned, and everyone has turned their will over to God, as you understand him (he quickly adds), then we will continue our attacks until all have been restored to sanity!"" he thrusts upwards with a finger and the group behind him cheers.
The news anchor is back on the screen, seen quickly putting away a flask. He clears his throat.
""Uhm, well then, ahem-ack, excuse me… more at eleven!""",0
"""Who here has been in an aDAM attack?"" I said, addressing the college audience. I was glad I was here, giving my account of the aDAM attacks. It was a good job; I sacrificed too damn much for this world, and it had given me little in return. Being a touring guest lecturer across the world was a dream come true.
Two kids raised their hands in the fact. The girl looked like she was about to fall asleep, but the guy poked her with a cane-yes, a someone still used a *cane* in 2112. The guy also raised his hand, his face grinning broadly. It really made me want to smack it right off.
""Interesting. There's at least 300, no, 500 students in this lecture hall? Usually, I get a lot more. I'm sorry. I apologize for not doing my duty as a U.N. soldier. Civilian casualties have been rising over the recent aDAM Encounters. Let us have a moment of silence and pray for all the students who could not make it here today.""
And then there was that moment of silence. After lowering my head for the smallest of tilts, I opened my eyes early to find those same two kids looking at me. The girl looked bored, and the guy looked like he was trying his hardest crack up silently. It looked like he was having a spasm.
""You. Girl with the auburn hair and guy with the cane. Get up here,"" I demanded. The girl looked annoyed-did she have resting bitch face or something? -and elbowed the guy, who couldn't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing. The rest of the auditorium was quiet as the duo made their way forwards. It made the cane's impacts with the floor that much louder.
""You two are also U.N. soldiers, aren't you? Cains?""
""Eh? Yeah, how did you know?"" the girl said, looking surprised.
""Arrogant brats,"" I growled. ""Stop lying. First of all, even if you were Cains, you're not a soldier yet. You two are still students.""
""Well, duh, we're students in a college auditorium...""
""Don't give me that attitude,"" I snarled. I wanted to slap her face. In fact, the guy's too. He gave up standing and was rolling around on the floor.
I put an arm proudly on my black uniform. ""I am a U.N. soldier, part of the 82nd generation. I have fought in the previous 12th aDAM Encounter, when the aDAMs decimated Paris and terrorized everyone in France. I was pinned to the ground for hours when the level of the Gravity Field surpassed everybody's expectations. Do you know how hard it is to be helpless, unable to move? I only survived because I drank the rainwater that sipped into my mouth. I couldn't do anything as the aDAMs stepped onto my fellow soldiers and brothers. And you, *you* have the gall to pretend to be U.N. soldiers?!? You have not been in my situation! Have you been bragging to your friends that you're one of the lucky few to be Cains, defenders of humanity? Don't make me laugh. You're sad, pitiful, human beings.""
This time, the girl also began cracking up. ""Ooooh boy,"" she giggled. ""This guy is really a looner.""
Then the guy finally began to speak. ""Please dude, stop speaking. You're embarrassing us. A true Cain never talks about past aDAM Encounters they've been in. They're too traumatizing.""
""Too traumatizing for spoiled kids like *you*, I presume. And what about this?"" I said, clasping my uniform. ""Where are yours? Let me guess. They were somehow vaporized by the aDAMs, leaving you barely alive to tell the tale?""
""Wow, how did you guess?"" the guy said, raising his eyebrows.
""I think mine's in the laundry,"" the girl said. She had a pinky in her ear, digging around for some earwax or something. Again, it made me want to tear their heads off. ""Who's dead body did you get yours from?""
""Enough. Have an arm wrestle contest with me,"" I growled, lying down on the ground.
""Arm wrestle contest?"" they both said simultaneously. Then they both began laughing again.
""It is below me to use violence,"" I said. ""But I need to teach either of you to learn your places in front of a true Cain.""
""Sure. Jenn, you got this,"" the guy said. The girl sighed, but also laid down.
I'll concede. I was not actually a Cain. The boy was correct; I looted the uniform off a corpse. But the experience was true. I was in Paris when the aDAMs hit and destroyed my life forever. My family was killed instantly: fiancee, parents, and everybody else at my wedding. Only my one-year old daughter was left alive, born out of wedlock. But despite our sins, my entire family, none of us deserved to die. It's a horrible feeling, having your child die in your arms, because the damned Cains took too damned long to slay the aDAMs.
So I undertook my revenge. Of course I couldn't use violence directly and suicide bomb into their headquarters or something. But I could embarrass Cains, like those two naive fools who thought they could challenge me. My arm wasn't real; lost in the Parisian aDAM Encounter, I had it replaced with a robotic arm. covered with real skin. A strong robotic arm, one that would not lose to even Cains. The charade has been going on for a while, and been going well. I was having my revenge.
""So cocky you think you can beat me, little girl?"" I said, readying my arm. To my surprise, she took her pinky out of her ear and placed that sole finger on my palm.
""Ready?"" she said, and at that moment, I knew I was fucked. A split second later, bolts and screws were flying around everywhere, electricity spewing from splayed wires as I stared in shock.
""God, you're such a dumb dude if you didn't think the U.N. was watching you,"" the guy said, yawning. ""Please. H.Q. wanted to expose you directly with a public announcement, but we Cains convinced them that we wanted to have some fun. Mannnn it was hilarious seeing you 'beat' Cains in arm-wrestling contests who pretended to try their hardest. Shame Jenn here was getting too pissed off.""",0
"James set his bags down in front of the desk and sized up his opponent. Female, five-six, about a hundred sixty pounds, and a poof of blonde-but-your-grey-roots-are-showing on top a small hill of makeup. A plastic name tag announcing her as ""Kathy"". A fleshy grin did little to calm his unease.
""Hello, will you be flying with us today?"" Kathy was, despite appearances, bright enough to make utterance. Not that James needed to be reminded that ability cannot be determined by appearance.
Silently, he reached into his pocket and placed a card in her hand.
*I am mute. I can hear you just fine. I can understand you just fine. I cannot speak to you. I will write to you instead. * **Please do not shout at me. **
""Oh!"" Kathy's surprise was more palpable than most. ""Well, I'm sorry to hear that."" Her manners, however, were not. ""How can I help you today?""
James was already busy inscribing instructions on his notepad. *My name is James Snyder. I need to board flight 7510 to San Francisco. I have two bags I need to check in. I would like to go through the special security line. *
Some long suppressed memories of being humiliated in the normal security lines started to bubble to the surface. James choked those back down to the pit of his stomach.
""Well, James, I'll need to see your driver's license and the credit card you used to make the transaction."" Somehow she had missed that he had already placed those on the counter. ""And I see here that I already do have record of you here, and it does mention your … your, uh…."" *Condition, you idiot. Just say condition. * ""… well, never mind that. I can give you access to the special security line. That'll be fine.""
Still looking forward to the day when all airport transactions could be handled completely by computers, or robots, or androids, or pretty much anything but Kathy, James flicked the side of his cards to give the appearance that he had just now tossed them on the counter. His sleight of hand caught Kathy's eye, and with a curt ""thank you"" she was busy typing the relevant information into the system. James' attention was directed to his right where, overwhelmed by lack of cooperation from her toddler, a young and pretty mother was struggling to lift a large bag onto the scale.
""Please place your first bag on the scale, sir."" Kathy's interjection snapped him back to the unpleasantness at hand. ""I have your boarding pass and security checkpoint pass, and we only need to check your luggage."" James was, of course, already familiar with the procedure, but easily lifted booths bag onto the platform where they were weighed, tagged, and sent off to oblivion. Without a word, Kathy engulfed the boarding pass in a wasteful paper envelope, snagged James' credit card and driver's license off the keyboard in front of her, and passed the ensemble to James' expectant hand. ""Enjoy your flight, sir!""
It wasn't every day James got to hear words so hollow. But no matter; this part of the adventure was, at least for James, over.
James made his way to the left and turned the corner to the security checkpoint. Like most Friday afternoons, a buzzing line of loud, obnoxious people stretched and wove over itself at least half a dozen times. *I wonder if I could count all those people, * James thought to himself, before wondering why he would have ever wondered such a thing in the first place. But James wasn't going to have to deal with that line. His line, the accessibility line, contained all of three people.
James was about to redeem his pass through the easy line when something at the end of the longer line caught his eye. A young mother with an apparently disoriented toddler. The pretty one he had seen before at the ticketing counter. Just about his age.
Without a word, James joined the long line.",0

""Now then...How shall we begin?""
I awoke only a few minutes ago with a pounding headache, naked and tied to a chair in a dark basement. The man standing before me was impeccably dressed in a well-tailored suit and snappy shoes. He was brandishing a red-hot iron in front of my face.
""Branding is traditional,"" he said waving the iron around in the air, ""and I daresay, I quite enjoy starting with it. It sort of...Makes you mine, you know?"" He grinned. ""But for you...I think I'll do something special. After all, you were very hard to get a hold of.""
I tried to scream...To call for help in complete desperation that someone, anyone, would hear me. The sound was muffled. This madman had gagged me. There was no begging for mercy.
The man surveyed his various tools and instruments. Picking them up one by one and scruntizing them. Even though my vision was still blurry from whatever he drugged me with, I could still tell his devices and blades were far from surgical. They were rusty, dirty, bloody too, like he used them all before and never cleaned them.
""Maybe we'll start big,"" he said as he picked up a long nail. My eyes widened with terror as he stepped quickly towards me. With one hand he held my head still and slowly inched the nail closer to my eye. I swear, it was mere millimeters away when he pulled back. ""Nah...Too sensitive. Don't get me wrong, we'll get to that, but I'm a man who likes to build up.""
He walked over to the corner of the room and picked up a large hammer. He swung it over his shoulder and began strolling towards me once again. I began to panic as he got closer. He stood just off to the side and brought the hammer down until it just touched my foot. He began to act like he was about to tee-off against my foot. As he raised the hammer into the air about to swing down, he laughed a maniacal laugh before feignting the swing and bringing the hammer back to rest over his shoulder.
I was crying and panting heavily through the cloth that was stuffed in my mouth. A stream of hot urine trickled down my leg.
""Ooo!"" The man said placing the hammer down and gleefully rubbing his hands together. ""I haven't even touched you yet and you're already this much of a mess! This is going to be fun!"" He walked back to the table of his horrid tools. ""I think I know what to do with you now...""
I could bearly see him anymore through the tears flooding from my eyes. I kept telling myself that this had to be a terrible, terrible nightmare, but the cold steel of the chair and the chaffing of the ropes binding my hands grounded me in reality. I couldn't see what the man was looking at, but before he could turn towards me, his phone rang in his pocket.
He groaned and swore as he answered it. ""What?!"" He snapped. ""Oh! B-boss! I...Sure, I can but you see...I...I...Yes sir, I'll be right there."" He hung up and wlaked towards me. ""Seems our playdate will have to wait. You won't go anywhere, will you?"" He mocked and patted me on the cheek. He turned around, walked up the stairs, and shut off the light.
I was alone in the darkness. The only sound I could hear was my muffled sobs. There was nothing for me now, only despair as I waited for him to return. I tried to escape. I jerked my body in any direction that I could but it was no use. I let out a stifled cry of defeat.
Then I felt my hand move. There it was! A glimmer of hope in that dark basement! Through some miracle, a knot was loose and I was able to free my hands and escape the chair. I fumbled around in the darkness for sometime before finding a lightswitch. When my eyes adjusted to the brightness, the first thing I saw was a macabar display of photos on the wall, each featuring a previous victim of this psycho.
I took a deep breath and calmed myself before rushing up the stairs. I looked around the corners and peeked through cracks in the door to insure it was safe. I stole whatever clothes I could find and moved towards the front door. I had to get to the police. I had to get this man arrested.
My hand was on the knob when I turned around. Behind me was the door to the basement I would have died in. It seemed like something was compelling me to stay. Instead of fear, I was now feeling anger. I took my hand off the door and waited.
It was a hour or so later that the man returned. As he rounded the corner, I swung a heavy frying pan into his face. As he fell to the floor, reeling in pain, I smothered him with a rag soaked in chloroform.
He was securly tied to the chair when he came to. I was examining the very things he planned to use on me. I turned to him.
""I hope you don't mind, but I burrowed a suit. It fits me rather well, no?"" I picked up a hot iron and walked towards him.
""Now then...How shall we begin?""",0
"[translated]
It was the mystery of the century.
Voyagers, looking for Spice, landed on the moon of a third planet from the star Proxell. What they found, no one could believe.
Found on the surface was a white banner attached to the end of a fairly preserved metallic rod. Scientists have dated the material to be only approximately one thousand Creaxellion years old. Closer inspection of the banner leads some to believe that dyes were imbedded within the fabric, perhaps with the intention of inscribing a message on the banner.
Additionally, small imprints on the lunar surface were also found; however, these prints did not match any life form found on Creaxellion. Aluminum pieces were found scattered within the flag's viscidity, but scientists have yet to make anything of this.
All of this was big news, considering there were no other signs of life in the entire solar system or any nearby systems...
An examination of the host planet could suggest that a primitive civilization might have inhabited the planet and developed sufficiently enough to reach their satellite moon. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this claim. Other scientists suggest that the host planet, due to its lack of water and its high levels of radiation, could never support intelligent life. Whatever the case, the search for the truth continues, and our citizens continue to ponder our seemingly unbridgeable aloneness in the vast ocean of space and time.",0
"""You're aware of how this works, right?"" the priestess said as she brewed the potion. ""You drink and enter a deep sleep. Only a few seconds...Or a few days. The stronger the power, the longer you sleep.""
The young man wore only simple robes and badly worn sandals while she wore an elegant gown. With the silver chalice she brought over to him, inside held the potion. It both shined brightly while it was pitch black, was both light and heavy and filled the room with hope and dread. ""Drink,"" she said as she handed him the chalice.
It didn't just enter like any other liquid. It slipped in like a slime, refusing to part no matter how much his jaw or tongue fought against it. He could feel it slide down into his stomach throughout. It had literally no taste, no feeling but it just slid further. He could somehow...Sense it. Only when it had reached his stomach did he feel anything else as he began to fall over.
He could feel the sheer scope of his powers, how small and large they were. He knew just how small and fine the world was, how it all worked. Atoms...Small packets of energy that everything was made up from. However, there were smaller things than that. Protons, neutrons and electrons, how they interacted with the world...But his power was over quarks, smaller then. He could change and control those smaller objects.
And light...He could control, make and destroy it. No...You can't create or destroy, only change...But that no longer applied to him. He now had sovereign control over the very concepts of life and death and could create and destroy to his will.
Then he saw the sheer scope. He could easily see the entire world...Several worlds, all spinning around the sun which he now saw for what it truly was, a large flame in the void. Soon, he could preceive hundreds, then thousands, then millions of stars spinning together into a sinlgle vortex...Before he saw millions of galaxies, all floating within a blackened void before he could only perceive them as he did the quarks...Before expanding itself millions upon millions of times...And he could see and control the small on the same scale as he did the large.
He could see the very definition of existence itself. He knew, he saw, he could, he would, he should - create, destroy, change, acknowledge, be...***EVERYTHING!!! ***
Within the smallest fraction of a second, he had reached his true power. It was too much for his mortal body which had violently exploded, destroying the mountain from which the temple was stationed along with everyone on or nearby. He only acknowledged it with a small slither of thought but he did regret the destruction caused. Within the same second as his death, everything was back to normal save his disappearance.
He was now the master of existence. He had the collective knowledge of everything that has happened, will happed and is happening...But he couldn't hide how...*giddy* he was. He had always been bullied by the others in his village for being the weakest and smallest child. They all or ceived great powers from the potion but they were microscopic - is that a word? Well, not until a Dutch spectacle maker invents it in the 1500s so...7,000 years roughy.
But he just didn't like how history unfolded! A group of fanatics always using the perceived existence of an all-powerful being to enforce a rule where so many suffered...But he just couldn't end suffering in the world. Of course, he'll create a kingdom the likes have never been seen!
But he needed a body...Well the universe was his body but that wasn't the point. He needed a form to interact with mortals and not frighten them, but one that showed he was above their station. So...Why not just create a new universe to be his body!? But that would be redundant...Ah, what did he care? The laws of the universe was his bitch and existence was his toy!
It wasn't too hard to create a new universe where there were creatures on each planet, in each solar system, in each galaxy, living and dying constantly...And he folded this universe into itself countless times until it was a vessel fit only for him. He scanned the minds for what they all considered perfect and used them to make a single form - old with a flowing beard of pure light to show endless age and wisdom, a stern gaze that perceives all and demanded respect, a powerful and perfect body of infinite and endless strength, 10 beautiful wings of pure white dove feathers that showed not only speed that he could fly through the universe but also endless compassion. He was draped in pure, golden robes signifyingneternal wealth but also sandals of pure red, smooth leather, signifying the endless journey that he could walk with a single step.
Over his head he placed hundreds of rings that floated above his head, each with beautiful jewellery which showed the endless kingdoms he now and forever ruled. The same meaning was within the throne made from perfect gold that he now sat upon, which also represented the endless sight from which he could see all his lands.
He was now within the centre of the universe and ready to rule but...He needed an army. Creating another universe, he tore out whole galaxies and molded them into his soldiers, the likes of which have never been seen before. Some were human, some were inanimate objects. He was proud of the Grigori, powerful dragons that could feed on suns at His command.
He stood from His throne and with a single step He and His army were now on the moon of His home world. He already knew the inevitable outcome, that He would be king of this world before it rotated halfway on its axis. He led the charge upon the world, ready to start His rule.
At the same time, had also discovered dinosaurs!

"You can hold it in your hand. Circular in nature it's flat rounded back, or front, fits smoothly against your palm. The cool metal giving heft to such a small object. Hinges on one side say open me, and on the inside of the round faceplate is a complex circular dial. Numbers from one to twelve ring the face, with twelve at the top, then one, two, three, etc. Three long lines pointed out at odd angles from the center of the circle, the thinnest one spinning at a regular rate around. Tick. Tick. Tick.
Staring at the dial for a while, you notice the other lines are moving too, if far more slowly. As the thinnest line ticks it's heartbeat around the full dial, the second thinnest line moves to its respective point around. Watching for a long while shows the thickest lines shift from twelve to one. At a guess, right now they make one three two. Hmm. The ticking line moves five times between each number. So then five fifteen ten. How about the largest, being so slow, is some daily measurement and uses the main number, but everything else uses the tick marks. So then it's one fifteen ten, or 1:15:10. Does that make sense?",0
"""Aw, don't cry my sweet little girl! You were so quiet earlier, even with all the racket my friends made!""
Shrill screams and crocodile tears stream from her face, unrelenting. She's heavy.
""Oh do you have a full poopie bag? Is that why you're crying? I might just have to take care of this before I can finish cleaning the living room. Such a poopie monster, aren't you.""
""Now, where did your mommy put those clean poo holders?""
He rummages through the shelves. Empty bottles and bottle caps. He grabs the wet naps and baby powder then turns to the closet nearby.
""There they are. Don't worry sweet thing, you'll be clean and tidy before you know it. I'm a cleaner by trade, and I'm the best.""
He sets her on the changing table and begins his dirty work. Tossing out the old diaper. Grabbing a fresh wet one and tidying up the tiny butt cheeks, covered in muck. A dash of baby powder. Then the fresh diaper, brand new.
The crying dies down.
""There you are sweetheart. Nice and clean.""
He picks her up and cradles her in his arms, gently. She's almost asleep again.
""Hush little baby, don't say a word..."" he sings softly as he places her back in her crib and begins to rock her back to sleep.
When the lullaby is over, he steps back to admire his work.
""No child should die screaming, ""he said as he reaches for the same gun he executed her parents with.",0
"Years of watching action stars grit and grin through the pain of a gunshot gave Bill hope in those last seconds. Each breath betrayed the blood gurgling up his lungs like a ship sprung a leak. Reality set in when he tried to stand and chase his attacker. Reality set in when he realized no one would be there to share this last moment with him.
No last words. No polite fictions that he will be fine. Just him alone in an alley he never took until tonight to see if it would save him thirty seconds on the way home.
Bill did not expect the pound as if struck by a hammer in his chest. He did not expect the searing heat of the metal cauterizing the edges of the neat crater it pocked above his heart. He did not expect the haggard addict to actually have the gun he promised. He did not expect his life to come down to a wallet with $21 crumbled bills and a bunch of plastic cards that would have been a red-tape hassle to replace.
He did not expect his years of Church and Kindness to amount to only a seating upgrade.
Bill laughed when he learned that Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory are just fire and brimstone synonyms for First Class, Economy, and Business. The only reward a good life will get you is more legroom on the inter-celestial express and a tiny bottle of water to sip while you wait to be processed at the gates.
Bill now reconsidered his morality and mortality as he sits boxed in by a car full of priests, rabbis, and monks. He breathes deeply finally having settled into his seat. A flock of old men fighting to square away gilded coffins of knickknacks, each one arguing their cargo is more precious than the others. Only the Buddhists know how to pack.
""Excuse me,"" Bill said. He climbed over a ninety-year old nun clutching rosary beads and whispering to the man she was going to meet.
Despite death, his stomach rumbled. He wondered what they would serve in the dining car. Nectar of the gods? He would rather steak.
Bill sat down in a booth in the crowded car and when the waitress gave him a menu he was happy to see a Ribeye listed. That and a beer and he might nap his way to eternal bliss.
Dying is hungry work, and Bill sat hunched over the cow flesh. He looked out the window at the purple band of the milky way disappearing on the horizon. When he looked up a stranger hovered near the edge of the table.
""Mind if I sit?"" a cheerful voice said. ""All the seats are taken.""
Bill debated this question for the first time ever. He had the first class ticket, what would kindness reward him with now? Nothing. Unless this was a test from God.
The man sat down. He looked familiar, but it was not until their eyes met that Bill's body pulsed with the hot flush of danger. He grabbed his knife tightly.
""You!"" Bill said to the man who pulled the trigger. The man who shot him. The man who took his life away...his family away.
""Do I...” the murderer said. Before his own eyes grew wide. ""You.""
""How could you...?"" Bill struggled to get the words out. He was filled with anger, sadness, and confusion.
""I was hungry…"" the murderer said matter-of-factly, eyeing the man's steak. His stomach grumbled.",0
"The border between Canada and the US was locked down completely. In a daring move President Obama decided to build a huge wall across the 49th parallel to show that Trump's not the only one that can keep illegals out.
But Steven needed to get to America, he lived the dangerous life of a maple syrup smuggler, delivering to private businesses who couldn't associate themselves with the poison that flowed out of Quebec and Ontario. Steven was based out of Vancouver and had contacts across British Columbia but ever since the closing of the 49th parallel he'd been unable to make his deliveries. To say his customers in Portland were mad is an understatement.
As the crates of syrup began to pile up in his garage Steven began receiving messages from the Portland mob. Ever since the wall went up syrup had been coming in as slow as molasses and the supply was viciously below the demand. As Steven realized the potential for a monopoly on the illegal trade of Maple Syrup plans began to formulate.
At 7:00pm the next week Steven took off on his Naden Big Laker loaded with crates of Maple Syrup onto the Fraser River. He planned to sail south along the Haro straight to land at Port Angeles on the northern coast of Washington where he would meet members of the Portland mob and sell the product.
As Steven passed the city of Victoria to his west and neared the oceanic border between the two countries he spotted a bright light coming towards him. he began to break out into a sweat as he worried that his contraband would be found. As the vehicle neared its speakers erupted ""Stop, you are piloting a Canadian made and licensed vessel into US waters, I repeat stop your vehicle."" As Steven slowed the boat he wondered what the sentence was for Maple Syrup smugglers. The police craft came to a stop adjacent to Steven's boat and two officers boarded his Laker...
""That's a lot of fucking syrup""
""Yeah""
""The hell you doing with it?""
""Makes a great coating for bait""
""You fishing?""
""Um""
""Because I don't see no poles. Listen I think I know what your up to, there hasn't been any good syrup in Washington for months, you trying to resupply the states aren't you""
""I need business and this is the only way to get it""
""We'll let you through, for a price.""
""Take three kilos, that's worth around seventy.""
""Alright then, we'll let you go on your way, I think this could turn into a mutually beneficial partnership. Next time you come to the States ask for Rick at the Port Angeles police station.""
""Will do officer""...
Steven arrived in Port Angeles at 9:00, waiting at the docks was a group of big men wearing brown suits. As soon as he landed they began unloading the crates, moving them into a large van. After the Laker was emptied one approached him handing him 13,000 Canadian dollars. Before they departed the man spoke.
""There's a lot of money in sticky business.""",0
"I roll my shoulders back as I see the mop of blond hair walk into the restaurant, I follow the man until he sits down, I sigh and shake my head trying to put all the memories I have with the man out of my mind, sure I grew up with him as my brother since I was 7, but when I was 20 and he was 22 he betrayed me, it doesn't matter that my part- no, my Ex-partner was killed by him. Not all that matters is that I was told to kill him, I watch carefully as the lifts the champagne flute to his lips, he raises his eyes slightly and I can see is eye plain as day through my scope, I squeeze the trigger every so lightly and watch in horrified satisfaction as the bullet engraved with the single sentence of ""Scorpia never forgets and Scorpia never forgets, Love Horseshoe"" slips into my adopted brother's forehead, right between the eyes. I set my calling card down; brush myself off. I walk away pull out my phone and mutter one simple sentence, ""Он умер."" He is dead.
Less than a month later I find myself pretending to mourn at Alex Rider's funeral, almost all of the K-unit is there. Almost, Fox is missing, he passed of a mission a few years ago, they still don't know about either if our jobs, and sadly they still think we're rich kids who have parents who hate them. At least one of them knew the truth.",0
"*****
The intercom crackles on.
""Kids, this is an experiment. We are going to test your survival skills with each other. It is impossible to leave until the observers are satisfied, and your devices have also been disabled. Think of it like the Hunger Games, but more than one person is capable of winning. Some will die, some will kill, others will go insane. May you be the one to survive. Let the experiment begin.""
I turn to the desk behind me and tell Sam.
""We are so winning.""
I run up to the front of the room, ever the outgoing type.
""If this is real, then we will be the ones to survive. I propose we go all in. We need some sort of government, jobs, a sizable area, and everything else. We will win.""
A wily-haired kid name Lawson steps up.
""Who put you in charge.""
I look around the room.
""Who here is willing to do whatever it takes?""
Half the room raises their hand. The other half think I am an idiot.
""Come with me if you wa-""
A scream breaks out down the hall. The class rushes to the hall, and sees a girl lying in her own blood in the middle of the hall. The class returns to the room and locks the door.
""Who here is willing to do whatever it takes?""
Everyone raised their hand this time. Lawson nodded at me and sat down.
""You are probably the best one to lead us anyway.""
""Thanks, man. Now, we need to assign roles. I am thinking,"" as I pick up an Expo marker, ""Sam, you head up diplomacy. You are easily the most-liked person in the room. It could get crazy in here. Jovanna will work with you. Jas, you will lead our ""military"". Gabe, Porco, and Jonathan, do whatever Jas says. Lawson, you are with me. Everyone else, I don't really know yet. Something will come up. Now we need a name.""
Everyone chatters for a few seconds, before the fat Jewish boy Gabe points out the sign on the wall.
""I think we already have a name. And a flag.""
The class burst out in agreement and laughter.
""Well, it looks like we are Mrs. Roberts' Rough-Riding Rednecks.""
""Or 4R, for short.""
""And we could be called the 4 R-my.""
The class let out a nervous laugh. This was getting real. They were like their own nation, up against who knows how many others. It very well could be do or die.
""Now that we have that settled, it is time to establish power past Room 245.""
""How about we meet up with the classes on this end of the Math Hall? Our six classes could definitely withstand all comers.""
""I had the same idea, Adam. You take some people and start setting up a wall halfway between this room and Room 243.""
""Can do. Uhhhh, can I have Omar, Olivia, and Tyler for the crew?""
The students in question all agreed.
""It appears we have a Building Crew. Great. Time to head out into the open.""

"Climate Change.
Both natural and un-natural are the source of my pain.
I am PVT. Joe Snuffy, a ""general-issue"" soldier trained for one purpose and one purpose only; To save the last remnants of the human race from itself.
Why the fuck am I here?
The end of the 20th Century saw much progress in areas of environmental pollution and cleanup.
From the 1970's, till the 2000's the progress that men had made was noticeable. But only to a few.
Gone were the smog and clouds of noxious fumes that polluted the atmosphere around our major cities in the 70's.
There was one problem.
Ignorance.
Even with 5 other major problems to deal with in the 21st Century, the mob, the masses...so focused on pup culture, never noticed the improvement.
By the time the left and right had gotten on the Band Wagon of environmental responsibility, it was too late.
When they noticed the other issues? it was too late to alter the path they had chosen. It took 30 years to get most of our ancestors on board the environmental bandwagon...they didn't have another 30 years to change the direction of the mob, the faceless masses. Inertia.
The masses, like lemmings, continued to push for tighter controls, wasting energy on the last 5% of improvement when there were more important issues to deal with.
Pop culture was the root cause. And cracking down on companies polluting was more important than the actual cleanup of the environment.
By middle of the 21st Century, our ""revered"" ancestors found themselves in a pickle worse than ever.
* Diseases, not seen in the northern hemisphere began to proliferate farther north than ever before, as if fleeing from something.
Mosquitoes began reproducing as far north as New Jersey and Delaware.
Black Mold formerly controlled by the low humidity of southern deserts then exploded to life in the humidity of the north.
These diseases burst upon the weakened immune systems of those in the north who had never been exposed. Thousands died.
* Famine, the result of ignoring water conservation as they depleted the aquifers.. pulling more water out than could be absorbed naturally.
Rising Food costs, shortages.
* petroleum shortage: the loss of pertroleum based fertilizers...the lower crop yields...the lack of fresh water.... these conditions only worsened the famine.
* Warfare: hungry people fight. with the changes in modern warfare numerous conflicts burst out upon the face of the earth like zits on a teenager.
We were so busy playing the game, making money, and protecting the environment from humans that we didn't protect ourselves.
By the end of the 21st century our enemy had begun to appear.
You see, something WAS driving the insects, the diseases, and the immigrants from the far south.
We had no clue.
When the ecology changed, so did the life forms.
Intense algae blooms in the Sargasso sea killed of fish and ecosystems by the thousands.
Temperature (from the environment), Sunlight for energy, and food, food from the fertilizers we washed into the ocean.
This chemical soup killed off the natural prey of some creatures.
These creatures would have to eat, would they not?
It was a tiny creature back then. no bigger than the palm of your hand.
People used to call them Star-Fish.
We call them ""Scourge"".
They began swarming out of the seas around 2058 and began consuming all life as if they were a swarm of locusts brought down on Egypt by the wrath of god.
We were clueless. Our ancestors were clueless.
An here I sit. In a bunker designed to protect me from artillery fire and surrounded by any enemy who needs none.
I sit in the darkness waiting.
I can hear the creak of the re bar and concrete groaning in pain as if clenched in some enormous fist.
Imagine this: me, Joe Snuffy, the pearl in the oyster.
There is a 30 foot starfish outside my bunker.
it's suckers pierce the cracks, and like a thousand tenticles, they reach out, touching and tasting me.
It's arms encircle my bunker like a lovers embrace.
It won't be long now.
I wonder if I will die screaming?

"I clutched the notebook in my hand, staring at my handwritten warning:
""March 10, 2016, 6:58 p.m.- The Flower Incident."" I checked my surroundings, and casually slipped my way into the bushes in front of Olivia's building. I had already messed this particular date up long ago. It was time to right an old wrong.
Of all my attempts to court Olivia, the flower incident had definitely been the worst. How was I supposed to know that she was allergic? Is there *any* appropriate reaction to anaphylactic shock on a first date? I shook myself out of my reverie when I heard footsteps approaching.
Sorry, let me back up. Or is it forward? I've been pretty confused about how to use verb tense ever since this all started back in (will start in? Ugh.) June 2017. There I was, minding my own business, just another young professional in a suit and tie on my way home from work. I was passing by an alleyway right next to my favorite kabob stand, when suddenly an eerily familiar voice hissed my name out of the shadows.
I jumped in shock as my head whipped toward the source of the sound. There, halfway crouched behind an overflowing dumpster, was a figure in a dark trench coat, large sunglasses that covered most of his face, and a hat that would have actually been quite stylish if the man didn't already look like he had walked straight out of a bad spy flick.
I like to think I'm the adventurous sort, but in that moment my sense of practicality stepped in and I turned my head back forward and my feet started moving again in the direction I was going. The stranger yelled as I walked away.
""Wait!"" he cried. I had definitely heard that voice somewhere, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. My head turned once more towards him, and he took off the glasses and hat. My jaw dropped. The stranger was… me. The lines in his (my?) put him (me?) at several years older than me, but the shape of his face, his eyes, the color of his hair, and his expression was exactly what I've seen in the mirror my whole life.
I started, and blurted out ""What kind of sick joke is- ""the man suddenly jumped from the shadows, cut me off by putting his finger over my lips in a shushing motion, and grabbed me by the tie and pulled me into the alley.
""Look, there isn't much time,"" the man muttered in a rapid tone, ""Yes, I'm you from the future. Just don't question it. The new Star Trek series sucked. Sorry. It was a big letdown. Pull your stocks out of Google right now.""
I stared at the man (probably me) with a blank expression. He had my own knowing but slightly amused expression all across my face as I sputtered. He had perfectly nailed my ""what would I do to verify myself to a past instance of myself if I was a time traveler"" questions. (Don't you even try to tell me you've never thought of these sort of things before.) He looked directly into my eyes with a serious look, swallowed, and said,
""So I'm back here because it turns out you're, uh, we're, uh,"" a look of frustration crossed his/my brow as he tripped over the unusual terminology, ""somehow critical to the future of the world. I don't get it, but the Council has determined that we absolutely need to date Olivia, or the future is going to fall apart. I don't get it either.""
I let my face scrunch up into a confused stare.
""And who… exactly is Olivia?""
He/me responded by pulling out a futuristic looking phone and showed me a picture on the screen.
""Her? I went on one date with her sometime last year, and it was a complete disaster! Flowers? What the heck was I thinking?""
The man winced, apparently re-experiencing the embarrassment along with me.
""Yeah. But, apparently the whole thing was meant to be, or some mystic bull-crap like that. They're calling it a ""Universal Quantum Touchpoint"" or something fancy like that, but basically, you need to take this,"" he said, pushing a device that looked suspiciously like a black Tamagotchi toy (which I definitely never owned) into my hand, ""And fix things with her.""
He gave me a meaningful look, as if he had given an adequate explanation, and stepped backwards. As he retreated, a faint wireframe of the faintest blue appeared on the lines of his figure. He took another step and the lines multiplied, covering most of his body. One more step, and the man vanished into the lines, and they suddenly converged and shot into the distance.
After recovering from the shock of meeting myself, I quickly found out the purpose of the device. It was a bona fide time travel device. I quickly dubbed it the ""Timeagotchi,"" for manly reasons completely unrelated to previous ownership of any similarly-named toy in my past. The first time I pressed the buttons on the front, any skepticism about the man who claimed to be me or his message pretty much vanished. I've seen some pretty high-effort pranks on the Internet, but, you just can't really deny the truth when you jump back fifteen minutes in time and watch yourself get abducted and then instructed by yet another instance of yourself.
So, I did as the man said. I started out by jumping a week before the flower incident. I reintroduced myself (is it appropriate to use the prefix re- if it was the first time for her? English just isn't built for these kind of situations) to Olivia. We had been riding the same train to work for years, but it had taken forever for me to gather up the courage to actually talk to her. We went on a nice date the next night. Coffee and ice skating. It went well, but when I called her for a second date later that week, she said that she thought we should just be friends.
So, I jumped a week back again. Movie and bowling. It was great, even better that the first. But when I called for the second date, I found myself still in the friend zone.
I jumped again. Carnival. Again. Homemade pizza. Again. A hike through the nearby hills. Each time, I was still in the friend zone, but I was getting to know her really well. I could see her face becoming brighter with each date, and the smile lines around her eyes deepening.
Finally, on the sixth jump, I finally had the perfect date with her. It ended with us walking down the moonlit beach, hand in hand. She looked into my eyes, and said,
""You know, we just met yesterday, but I feel like you understand me almost better than you understand myself. I love how you seem to be able to anticipate my every feeling.""
When I called for a second date the next day, I got an enthusiastic yes.
So, as I had been working my way back through Olivia's history, I had gotten into the habit of meeting her on a Tuesday, and taking her out on a Wednesday. I'm a creature of habit, I guess. It just so happened that our second date was also scheduled for a Wednesday. We got on the train, ready to head to a stage play, when suddenly, disaster approached. One car away, I saw myself enter with a bag of sports drinks and snacks, wearing shorts and hiking boots.
I excused myself from Olivia, muttering a lame excuse about needing the bathroom or something, and I pushed my way through the crowded car. I tapped myself on the shoulder.
""You. Off the train, now.""
My eyes, (the other me, not me, ah, you get it, right?) widened in surprise.
""But, hiking seems like such a great date for her!""
""Yeah, close, but no cigar. It took one more date to get to this,"" I said, pulling out my phone and showed him a moonlit selfie of me and Olivia, our faces pressed together with a wide grin that seemed to stretch across both our faces.
My (other me) eyes narrowed in acknowledgement, possibly jealously. Is it possible to be jealous of yourself? Without saying another word, he stepped off the train, pulled out the Timeagotchi, and disappeared in a flash of blue wireframe.
So that's how it went for the next few dates with Olivia. I was surprisingly cooperative with myself, for the most part. I took it pretty hard on the carnival date, but I had been in kind of a strange mood that night anyway. Olivia and I continued to grow closer and closer as we spent time together.
So that brings me to tonight, March 10, 2016. The original ""Flower Incident."" My head was spinning with the plans I'd made as I watched myself approach, holding a modest bouquet of flowers as I nervously approached Olivia's apartment for the first time. I stepped out from behind a hedge in front of the building, right in the path of my past self. He froze, the flowers quivering in his hand.
""Yeah, it's you from the future. The new Star Trek sucks, and pull your stocks out of Google."" I said, looking seriously into my eyes. Past me's eyes widened and he gave a tense nod. I moved to stand side by side with myself, putting my arm around my shoulders.
""Look, you and Olivia are a great match, I said,"" as I pulled out my phone in front of us and swiped through several pictures of Olivia and I. I ended of the one of Olivia and I on the beach, our first successful date. I put the phone away and plucked several flowers out of the bouquet. ""But, I said, she's deathly allergic to tulips. One whiff of these bad boys and she's gone.""
I stepped back in front of myself, looked into my eyes and said ""Just be confident, bud. You've already succeeded. Kind of. It's complicated. Just get up there, knock on her door, be yourself and have a great time."" I thumped myself on the back, and he stumbled forward towards the apartment door. When I'm already nervous, I have an amazing ability to just accept whatever's in front of me. Past me turned to look back at me, eyebrows high on his forehead, hand on the door handle. I grinned and gave him a double thumbs up. He shook his head, unsure of what to think, and turned back around and entered the apartment.
I watched him enter the building, and then stood there for a moment, the tulips still in my hand. A lump rose in my throat as I wondered what would happen. I felt a hand rest on my shoulder.
""You made the right choice,"" I heard my own voice say.",0
"The warmth of the bed was familiar to him. It was the same bed he had been born in fifty-two years earlier and that had been given to him as his own when his mother passed away. If he closed his eyes and concentrated hard enough he could still smell her somewhere deep within the bed frame - the scent of sunflowers and rain water and pure love. He missed his mother dearly and thought of her every day, thought of all that she had taught him. Things like love and tolerance. Of living in the moment and being open to new ideas and learning. Oh how she loved learning!
He knew he was dying. His cough had slowly gotten worse over the days - what started out as a tickle and rattle in his throat became a booming echo from somewhere deep within his chest. He didn't know what it was - a few others had gotten ill before him but all had recovered in a few days. For him it was different - was it his age? Was God angry with him? Oh how he wished his mother was still alive - wished they could investigate it together. One of his favorite memories was sitting up with her, late at night, whispering in the dark over theories and ideas of what the world was really like. What went on that they simply couldn't understand?
There was a knock at the door and a familiar face peered in, ""Fisher? Are you awake?""
Fisher shifted in his bed, holding back a deep cough. ""Yes Annie, come on in. I could use the,"" he paused as his voice caught in his throat. ""I could use the company.""
Annie closed the door softly and walked carefully over to the side of the bed. The room was dark and cold - the old man and the bed in one corner, with nothing else but a small metal chair by the door she had walked through. The metal legs of the chair would cause a lot of unnecessary noise, so rather than risk a beating she simply knelt down beside the bed.
The girl was twelve years old, dressed in a long off-white gown. Her hair was a dirty blonde that cascaded down to the middle of her back. She was thin and wiry, with a line of freckles across her face.
""I don't want you go, Fisher. You're my only friend here.""
The old man smiled, remembering back to his own conversation so long ago with his dying mother. ""I don't want to go either, honey, but it seems it's my time.""
""Is it true, Fisher? Is God angry with you?""
His instinct was to agree. Everything he was ever taught would say that this was true - God was angry at him and was punishing him. God was the only absolute truth in the world and humanity was wicked and vane to ever question that. It was the biggest sin to question your Lord and desire for knowledge. Who was man to question and know? Who was man to *learn*?
Only one person ever spoke any truth to him. His mother was the only one who ever invoked a sense of curiosity in him. A sense of yearning to see the world; to understand it. She did not hate God and did not reject him, but placed in her son an understanding that God had created such beauty in this world that it must be lived and loved.
It had taken the last few years for him to realize how much this community was a poison. It had taken this little girl to show him how backwards this way of life was. She reminded him so much of himself when he was younger, that all his mother had taught him came racing back. All those years of ""reeducation"" had melted away at the sight of pure curiosity displayed on her face each night as she crept into his room, eager to hear tales of musings long ago and far away.
""I don't know, sweetie. It's possible. But so are many things in this world. Maybe he is angry with me...or maybe I have simply lived as long as this old body can live.""
Annie seemed to perk up at that thought, ""Tell me a story, Fisher.""
""What do you want to learn about tonight, little Annie?""
""Where do people go when they die?""
The old man smiled as he looked up at the ceiling. People around here didn't like to think about death. They didn't like to think about what happened when they died. It wasn't for them to question. It wasn't for them to know. He let out a deep cough and wiped his mouth, ""*I* think we go home.""",0
"I slowly walk out of the alley, and blend with the crowd. As I walk, it hits me: It worked. It actually worked. I was sent back to 2014, before it all started. I had three years to stop it, no other purpose. The Russians invaded the Ukraine, and kept going. Before we knew it, they had planted trackers in all the anglets on shoelaces. Who would have suspected? They learned habits and positions of all enemy troops, and took full advantage of it. The captain told me to find him in this year, and explain to him whats going to happen. I'll be lucky if I don't get shot trying to get into Fort Wilson, and luckier if I don't get arrested after I explain. How crazy does it sound? ""Sir, I'm from the future with a message: Destroy all world shoelaces"" Christ, I don't believe myself saying it and I saw what it did to the world. I snap back to reality as I'm walking with the crowd. Fashion sure was weird three years ago. I don't miss the neon green swag hats, and ironic mustaches. Why can't I be eradicating swag merchandise? I would take personal pleasure in that. ""Destroy Shoelaces, Destroy the Russians"" That was what they told me before sending me back. I wasn't even aware we had time travel equipment, yet here I am about to save the world, one shoelace at a time.",0
"I was a normal person once. I worked a stable job. I had friends that I liked and trusted. There was even a girl that I was quite fond of. At some point though, I started feeling stuck. It was gradual at first, but then it started to gnaw at my mind, like a fucking rat trying to get out of a box. I would go to work in that same building, wearing the same series of shirts and ties. Sure sometimes I wore the blue one on Monday instead of Friday, but that didn't help. I tried taking up a hobby. A fucking hobby, what an inane concept, it's just a name we give something to try and prove to ourselves that it isn't just more of the same shit. I knew I needed to do something drastic. Looking back it was a stupid idea, but if I could do it again, I would probably do the same fucking thing.
edit: I just realized I am a few words over but I trimmed it down as best I could: P",0
"They used to tell me that there is no such thing as magic. Well, I can tell you right now that magic is real. Okay, it isn't actually magic, but the quantum-mechanical mumbo jumbo is so confusing that it might as well be. Reading a book on the particular quantum funkiness that changed my life is harder than translating a Latin version of the Necronomicon. All I wanted to know was how to control it.
It started in the summer of 2009. At first, it just seemed like a lot of strange coincidences were happening around me. It was little stuff, like finding a 20 $bill in my pocket whenever I wanted beer or receiving a phone call from someone at the same moment I happened to be thinking about them. Then, things got even crazier.
Whenever I found myself wanting something, it would immediately appear. I would hear a loud screeching sound and turn around to find the object of my desire hovering in the air before me. It only worked with inanimate objects at this point, so it would usually be food, drinks, shit like that. It even worked with electronics. That was the best part. Having whatever I wanted, when I wanted it.
It was fun for a while, having everything I could ever want. I didn't even question where these things were coming from. I assumed it was magic. It wasn't until I figured out how to conjure living things that I started to wonder how this was even possible. That particular skill was discovered while drunkenly lamenting over the fact that I lived alone. No pets, no roommates, no family. I started thinking about how awesome it would be to have a dog, even picturing the type of dog. A fluffy golden Labrador Retriever, with a blue collar.
Sure as shit, that damn dog appeared right in my apartment! I couldn't believe it, I checked to see if any windows and doors were open. All closed. I returned to the living room to find the dog nestled into a pile of blankets on the couch. I shrugged and went back to watching television. The next day, I conjured up a leash and took the dog for a walk. While he was pooping, I found myself staring at a picture that had been stapled to a telephone poll. It was a picture of a lost dog. The same dog that was now pooping in front of me.
The realization hit me like a gun-shot. I hadn't been conjuring things, I had been summoning them! So I called the number that was listed below the picture, and returned the dog to his proper owners. I made up a lie to explain away how I came to be in possession of their dog, and they believed it. Next, I considered trying to return or donate the electronics, but I couldn't figure out a way that wouldn't make it look like I was a professional burglar.
For the next several days, I struggled to keep myself from wanting things as I did as much research as I could to find out what the hell was wrong with me. My search led me to a bunch of books about quantum mechanics. I wasn't smart enough to understand any of them. I remember wishing that my ability allowed me to summon a higher IQ.
So I gave up. There was no controlling this thing. No stopping it. I was able to avoid summoning any more living things, but inanimate objects were still popping up left and right. I eventually came to accept that I was doomed to be a quantum-burglar for the rest of my life. Hey, at least I didn't have to worry about getting caught.",0
"""What even is it?"" the president asked the nervous scientists who had handed him the tablet in his hands.
""Well"" they looked among themselves waiting for one to speak first ""We believe it's like our arm, you can see by the mandibles and suction pads it's capable of manipulating objects and holding on with great force."" A voice came from the back of the group, as they made way for her.
""So our first contact is a picture of it what? Waving? Is this some kind of language barrier test. Like establishing a shared dictionary of terms?"" The president looked up at the scientist that answered, an older woman with graying hair and stern features.
""Exactly so Mr President and that's why I insist we respond likewise"" she answered excitedly.
""Okay, have it done. Lets make sure we get off on the right foot with them, I want this to be a world changing event and for the better.

""YOU DID WHAT?!"" Xarya's displeasure radiated from her like heat from a star.
""It was an accident, someone made their location the default"" I pleaded.
""A dick pic, you sent a picture of your PENIS to Earth as our first contact! AGGGHRGGHHH"" Xarya, fumed swinging her arms about knocking over various items on the bridge.
""Sir"" Anat's voice quietly interjected
""WHAT?"" she span with anger in her eyes.
""The humans have responded"" He gulped
Xarya, stormed over, ""I'm so embarrassed, please show me, have they demanded some kind of repayment for the insult?"" Her face blushed as she took in the image before her. A long thin pink object that splayed at the end in five different ways, each of various thickness and length.
Anat spoke, ""Seems they sent us one back""
""Is it bigger than mine?"" I asked",0
"My eyes close, the pain fades, and I rest for a while.
What wakes me is a shuffling sound. It's the sound sandals make when they're dragged across a stone floor. Oilsmoke fills my nostrils, and heat presses in on my skin.
I open my eyes.
Torches in sconces on the walls light the stone room. The ceiling hangs six inches above my head. Wooden tables are evenly spaced throughout the room. Every table is set with six wooden bowls, wooden spoons, and wooden cups. Rushes cover the ground. Dirt pokes up through the spaces between their fronds. The shuffling comes from somewhere past one of the walls.
""Hello?"" I call out.
I hear a sharp yelp, much like the sound a dog makes after its tail has been stepped on. ""Who's that? Who's there?"" The man's voice has the texture of pocket lint – worn, grey, fragile.
""I don't know how I got here.""
""Neither do I,"" the man says. The shuffling begins again and not long after he comes around the corner of the wall. His robes might once have been white, but they've become so stained I mistake them at first for burlap. His beard reaches to his belly-button, and it houses dust, twigs, and bits of bread. He comes right up beside me and peers into my face with his watery blue eyes. ""You're dead.""
He says it matter-of-fact, not as a question or a exclamation, but rather the way a droll teacher might address a student who has arrived late to class.
""I fell down those stairs at the tram station. I know that much,"" I say. ""But if I'm dead, how come I'm here and talking to you?""
""That should be pretty obvious, shouldn't it?"" The man pulls his beard apart with his two hands and reveals a silver medallion on a leather thong. The medallion reads Santo Petra.
""This is heaven?""
He snorts. ""It was.""
""Was?""
""Nobody comes here anymore. God's had the place decomissioned. He's built a newer, better heaven and said he'd have no need for me as gatekeeper anymore.""
""This is a joke. You're joking.""
""One of the newer saints, some Italian hotshot who wears leather vests and gels his hair in points, recommended that God dandy up the place, and, wouldn't you know it, but after millenia of asking the big guy to make some changes, he goes and decides to build a whole new heaven. Now they've got Saint Guido on the door and I'm left here to tend to the furniture and to move along the sad cases like yourself who end up here."" Saint Peter slumps onto a wooden bench. He picks a bowl up, waves his hand over it, and desultorily begins spooning up the stew that appears inside. ""You'll be wanting to move along now, won't you? Off to Heaven 2.0? The big party in the sky? I don't think they even call it heaven anymore, to be honest. It's got some greasy hip name, something like Blade or FaNaTiK. Ridiculous."" He waves his spoon around and fails to notice the glob of stew that falls into his beard.
""Doesn't sound all that great, to be honest. Probably lots of loud music, tight clothes, and orange people? Not really my scene.""
Saint Peter shakes his head. ""Oh, they all say that, but after a couple of years they come around. Just last year I had a dyed-in-the-wool social reject in here – this guy hadn't left his house or showered in five years. He died from an infection he got from pooing in the bathtub – was in H2.0 for two months and he made the decision to lose the weight, orange up the skin, and hit the dancefloor. Unbelivable. But it goes to show you'll be happy if you move along.""
I join him on the bench. ""For real, that sounds terrible. I'd rather hang out in the quiet here with you.""
""You can't be serious.""
""Really I am. I'm a quiet book person. Noise is the last thing I want to be around for eternity.""
Saint Peter looks left and right out of the corners of his eyes. ""Definitely?""
""Yah, for sure. Get me some old robes and pass me some stew.""
""Call it off, everybody."" Saint Peter gets to his feet. ""Call it –"" An air horn cuts him off.
A banner unfurls behind Saint Peters table. YOU JUST GOT PUNK'D! The stone in the walls around me collects into drips and drops and they spread out in puddles on the floor. The rushes fade away and what's left behind is a black reflective surface, in which I now see reflected laser light. A heavy bass thrum builds out of nowhere, and over it I hear a staccato piano melody rising and falling. People stream into view, all of them dressed in tank tops, crop tops, board shorts, mini-skirts, and flip-flops. Their skin glows orange. I catch snatches of the words they're shouting: ""Shots...slammered...crush pussy...skank...jagerbombs.""
Saint Peter pulls off his robe to reveal similar clothes underneath. His pale skin oranges. The music is so loud I can barely hear him. ""It's a game we play with new people! Nobody likes lame medieval heaven! But I promise, if you give it a couple of months, you'll learn to love it here!""
Cold gel is slapped into my hair. Cans of spraytan erupt all around me. The sleeves of my shirt are torn away.
""You'll love it! I promise!"" Saint Peter hi-fives people around him. ""After all, this is heaven!""",0
