"Shares of food and beverage giant PepsiCo Inc rose sharply Thursday on rumors that it could be a takeover target of Philip Morris Cos Inc.
Industry experts flatly dismissed the rumor, saying a pricetag on any potential transaction would be an astounding $60 to $80 billion.
Instead, they said the rumor, just the latest to surface about PepsiCo in recent months, underscores widespread dissatisfaction about the company's outlook.  
""I don't ever say no to anything, but I think this is a farfetched rumor,"" said Martin Romm of CS First Boston.
Officials from PepsiCo and Philip Morris declined to comment on the rumor, citing company policy.
But shares of PepsiCo, which have been active recently, jumped 1-3/8 to 30-1/2 and Philip Morris gained 1-1/8 to 97. Wall Street rumblings began earlier this week and the rumor picked up steam after a Thursday report in the New York Post.  
The New York Post cited a rumor on Wall Street that Philip Morris would offer $50 a share for PepsiCo.
The speculation of a deal with Philip Morris comes less than one month after PepsiCo announced a major plan to pull out of weak international beverage markets.
The restructuring, which called for a charge of more than $500 million against earnings, also included cost-cutting targets and continued focus on its Frito-Lay snack food unit.  
But Wall Street is disappointed with the company's indecision about its casual restaurant business, which has performed below expectations. PepsiCo said it is reviewing those operations and analysts widely expect the company to eventually sell the business.
In the meantime, earnings growth will rest heavily on the strong Frito-Lay division.  
""In 1997, a large (part of PepsiCo earnings) is going to be riding on the shoulders of Frito-Lay. Frito-Lay, in my opinion, has to deliver next year,"" said Skip Carpenter of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, who does not anticipate a major turnaround for the international beverage business until 1998 or 1999.
Analysts said PepsiCo reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday that met expectations, but failed to excite investors.
If PepsiCo sells the restaurant business as expected, the company may pour some of those proceeds into acquisitions to further beef up the solid snack food business, analysts said.  
Analysts also have dismissed recent rumors that PepsiCo would be interested in buying Starbucks Corp. They said a transaction between the two would likely dilute PepsiCo earnings and disappoint investors who want the company to exit the casual dining business.
Both companies declined to comment on the PepsiCo-Starbucks speculation. The two companies are in a joint venture for the production and sale of a cold coffee beverage called Frappucino.  
Philip Morris' huge product line includes Post breakfast cereals, Marlboro cigarettes and Kraft cheese.",0
"The U.S. food industry, besieged by years of slow growth, wants to whip up new business from people who don't cook.
Armed with a new study that predicts consumer spending on ready-made foods will accelerate in the next 10 years, food firms are reaching out to a generation that doesn't know the difference between baking powder and baking soda.  
""Consumers aren't looking anymore for a cake mix.  They want the slice of cake,"" said John Gray, executive director of the International Foodservice Distributors Association, which helped fund the study released this week.
Industry executives this week said they are developing fresh strategies to feed 18-to-24 year olds -- a generation that grew up with working mothers and microwave ovens.
""Cooking from scratch is diminishing: many consumers in 2005 will never have cooked a meal from basic ingredients,"" said the study by consulting firm McKinsey & Co Inc titled ""Foodservice 2005: Satisfying America's Changing Appetite.""  
The study confirms trends that food manufacturers and food distributors already are seeing: harried consumers bypass the fresh meat and spice aisles of a supermarket in favor of sections selling barbecued chicken and ready-made salad.
The study projects the food industry will grow 1.6 percent per year to nearly $800 billion a year by 2005.  The foodservice sector is expected to capture nearly all of the anticipated incremental sales, pegged at $100 billion.  
""There is going to be a whole new plethora of different foodservice opportunities,"" said William Eacho, president and chief executive officer of  Atlantic Food Services, a Virginia-based foodservice distribution company.
Tomorrow's supermarkets are expected to have drive-up windows where consumers can buy ready-made meals.
Executives also envision stores that group food by meal categories so that shoppers can head right to the breakfast aisle instead of wandering throughout the store.  
The changes are expected to be especially challenging for food manufacturers, who may see shelf space for their products shrink as stores provide more ready-made products.
Nabisco Holdings Corp already is experimenting with ways to ensure its products are not lost in the shuffle.  The maker of items such as Oreo cookies and Grey Poupon mustard wants to leverage its brand popularity into ready-made meals.
""As a major food manufacturer, we ought to have our fair share of that growth,"" said Henry Lambert, president of Nabisco's food service company.  
That may mean developing a Grey Poupon-based sandwich spread for supermarket sandwiches or working with a dessert manufacturer to sell individual slices of cheesecake that contain Oreo cookies, Lambert said.
And demand for those kinds of products is expected to grow as consumers spend less time preparing meals.  Industry experts estimate people now spend about 20 minutes preparing a meal versus two hours of preparation time about 50 years ago.
""The meal is not the social setting of the evening anymore. It's a nuisance,"" said Robert Stauth, chairman and chief executive officer of food distributor Fleming Cos Inc.",0
"Fast-growing Republic Industries Inc., which is led by Florida entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga, said Thursday it would buy Alamo-Rent-A-Car Inc. for $625 million in a move to sharply expand its automobile business.
The deal comes less than six weeks after the collapse of Huizenga's $4.3 billion plan to buy security firm ADT Ltd.
""Leisure travel is a fast growing segment of the automobile rental industry and Alamo's innovative leadership in this growth sector of the automobile rental marketplace is consistent with our strategy of building consumer-oriented, service related businesses with recognised brand names and strong management,"" Huizenga said in a statement.
Republic is expected to use Alamo to expand its burgeoning auto business rooted in used-car company AutoNation USA.
Huizenga ""wants to be the largest used-car sales, leasing and rental provider. It makes sense to have the Alamo fleet as a warehouse for his vehicles,"" said Andrew Jeffrey, analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co.
Alamo is the fourth-largest rental car company in the United States, with a fleet of about 130,000 vehicles. Alamo operates in 42 states in the United States and has operations in 10 European countries and Canada.
Alamo founder and Chairman Michael Egan, who owns about 94 percent of the company, will continue as chairman of Alamo.
Huizenga said Republic's AutoNation USA car business will benefit from Alamo's strong relationships with manufacturers and other automotive suppliers.
""The combination of Alamo with Republic's 'like-new' automobile retailing concept is an exceptional fit that will enable AutoNation USA to accelerate its business plan and create a unique, dedicated and predictable source of inventory for our megastore distribution system,"" he said.
Republic bought used-car company AutoNation earlier this year and opened its first superstore about two weeks ago in Florida. It plans to open three or four more AutoNation stores this year and quickly expand the chain so there are some 80 stores around the nation by the end of the decade.
AutoNation will be supplemented by Republic's recent $95 million purchase of used-car superstore firm CarChoice Inc.
Investors praised the latest acquisition by Republic, bidding the company's stock up $2.875 to $33.625 on Nasdaq. The deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.
In addition to the automotive industry, Republic specialises in electronic security and solid waste companies. Huizenga also owns the professional Florida Marlins baseball, Panthers hockey and Dolphins football teams.
Huizenga suffered a setback in late September when his plan to buy security firm ADT was called off after weeks of uncertainty. Although the stock deal was viewed positively from a strategic standpoint, it fell apart due to volatility in Republic's stock and the inability of the companies to revise terms of the transaction.
Analysts saw little chance of that happening with Alamo.
""I think Alamo provides Republic everything that ADT did, plus more, from the auto side,"" said Jordan Hymowitz of Montgomery Securities, who rates Republic shares as a buy.
Republic also said it will pursue more car deals.
""We're interested in growing in virtually every segment of the automobile industry,"" spokesman Ronald Castell said, citing rental, used cars, repairs and financing.
The acquisition of Alamo marks the latest in a flurry of transactions in the rental car industry.
On Wednesday, ADT said it planned to sell its U.S. auto-auction business, ADT Automotive. The unit is the nation's second-largest automobile auction company, and its sale would mark ADT's complete exit from that business after it sold its European auto-auction unit last year.
Last month, hotel and real estate operator HFS Inc. bought Avis Inc., the world's second largest car rental company, for about $800 million. HFS has said it will pursue another similar acquisition and launch an initial public offering for part of its rental car subsidiary next year.
Ford Motor Co., which owns Hertz, in July announced it was expanding its rental car business with the acquisition of Budget Rent-a-Car. Ford already had owned part of Budget.
Meanwhile, Chrysler Corp. wants to sell subsidiaries Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car.",0
"In yet another sign that utilities are branching out far beyond their traditional markets, PacifiCorp and Protection One Inc. on Friday announced a marketing alliance aimed at boosting customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive industry.
Under the venture, customers of PacifiCorp subsidiaries Pacific Power and Utah Power will be offered a security system from regional alarm company Protection One.
The unusual alliance is viewed as the first of many creative ventures in an uncertain era of utility deregulation.
""This is the start of what is going to happen all over the place. It's a whole new business that will coattail on the aggressive nature utilities are starting to take. One-stop shopping is becoming key from a marketing position,"" said Ron Chebra, manager of utilities and energy industries at AT&T Solutions.
Utilities are becoming increasingly attracted to security companies as they prepare to enter new markets that previously had been off-limits due to federal regulations. In recent months, utilities have bought security firms or made large investments in them.
""We're looking for new products and services that we can bring to our customer base as a way to build loyalty and ultimately build preference with our residential customers,"" said Rene Carroll, consumer products manager at PacifCorp.
""We've been looking at different ways of entering the home security business for over a year,"" she added.
The alliance will give Protection One instant access to the 1.4 million customers served by the PacifiCorp subsidiaries and extends its reach to Utah. Previously, the regional security firm served six western states.
At a recent conference on mergers in the security industry, Protection One officials declined to discuss potential revenue from the alliance, but noted that capturing even 5 percent of PacifiCorp customers would be significant.
Customers accepting the offer will receive free installation of a home security system with the purchase of a two-year agreement for monitoring services.
The security system's alarm panel also will hold thermostat and lighting controls and remote access.
The alliance is expected to be just the first step for Protection One, which is trying to take advantage of new opportunities that are emerging from deregulation of the utilities and telecommunications industries.
""We think this is the first of quite a few announcements we'll be making in the next 12 months or so,"" Protection One Chief Financial Officer John Hesse told Reuters at the recent security conference.
The alliance re-establishes a link between the two companies that was dissolved several years ago. Protection One began as a subsidiary of PacifiCorp in 1988, but the alarm company split off in a management buyout three years later. Protection One then became a publicly-traded alarm company in 1994.",0
"Conrail Inc. and CSX Corp. so far have convinced the courts that their $8.6 billion merger plan should proceed, but they still need to win over unhappy shareholders who favour Norfolk Southern Corp.'s higher bid.
Lawyers and financial advisors were expected in the next few days to consider several plans aimed at persuading investors to approve a crucial measure needed for the deal.
Meanwhile, CSX said Thursday that its $110 cash tender offer for 19.9 percent of Conrail shares, which represents the first part of its plan to buy Conrail, was oversubscribed.
The proposed stock and cash transaction has angered many investors, who prefer an all-cash $10 billion offer by Norfolk Southern, based in Norfolk, Va.
Philadelphia-based Conrail has rejected the Norfolk Southern offer of $110 a share, saying the union with CSX provides more strategic benefits.
Sources close to the companies said no final decision has been made about how to woo Conrail shareholders, but options include sweetening the stock portion of the deal or setting a ""collar"" to guard against price volatility.
They will also consider revising the deal's terms to accelerate payment to investors, according to the sources, who did not want to be identified.
The two companies could also decide to keep the terms unchanged, betting that shareholders will ultimately choose the CSX offer over Norfolk Southern's offer, which cannot be formally considered by Conrail until July.
""There's only one thing they can do and that's to sweeten the offer. I don't know how they're going to get enough votes if they don't,"" said Thom Brown, managing director at investment firm Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood Inc., which holds some 50,000 shares of Conrail.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX and Conrail declined to comment on their plans, but acknowledged last week they were discussing increasing the value of the pact upon its consummation.
Sources close to the companies said there is no rush to make a decision, noting that Conrail can easily postpone the shareholder vote that is now slated for mid-December.
CSX and Conrail won a significant victory this week when a U.S. district court judge denied a request by Norfolk Southern to block the CSX-Conrail deal. An appeals panel also declined to block the first step of the deal.
Norfolk Southern, meanwhile, withdrew its motion for an expedited appeal of the federal court ruling that allowed CSX to buy the 19.9 percent stake in Conrail, since the tender offer expired at midnight on Wednesday.
But a group of Conrail shareholders pursuing a lawsuit and appeal similar to Norfolk Southern's did not withdraw their motion for expedited appeal. The group urged the court on Wednesday to hear an expedited appeal and ""sterlize"" the 19.9 percent Conrail stake by preventing CSX from voting it at a shareholders meeting needed for the merger to occur.
Because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits a company from buying more than 20 percent of another company in a cash tender offer, shareholders will be asked in mid-December to approve a measure that would permit CSX to buy 40 percent.
The CSX-Conrail transaction calls for CSX to buy 40 percent of Conrail shares for $110 per share in cash and exchange the remaining 60 percent for CSX stock.
Sources close to the company said Conrail and CSX were well aware of the potential difficulties in winning the necessary votes.
Industry experts believe shareholders may be more willing to approve the 40 percent measure if they were guaranteed more favourable terms for the stock portion of the deal.
""They can't get the vote until they improve the back-end of the deal and they know that,"" one takeover specialist said.
Meanwhile, Conrail stock tumbled, reflecting the expiration of CSX's tender offer. The stock fell $2.25 to $94.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Based on Thursday's stock price, the Conrail-CSX transaction values shares of Conrail at about $95.10 each. The stock portion of the deal would be exchanged at a value of about $85.15 for each Conrail share.",0
"The stock of American Medical Response Inc. fell sharply for the second consecutive session Wednesday on concern that the Aurora, Colo.-based ambulance company is straying from its successful acquisition strategy.
The steep decline came after American Medical Response announced Tuesday an agreement to buy STAT Healthcare Inc. in a stock transaction valued at $145 million.
The planned acquisition moves American Medical Response, which has bought 69 ambulance companies since 1992, into hospital emergency rooms and disease management.
The stock of American Medical Response tumbled $4 on the New York Stock Exchange to $30.50. The stock dropped $3 after the transaction was announced on Tuesday.
Wall Street analysts said the deal was strategically sound from a long-term perspective, but noted that investors were wary of the company's shift into a new area.
""The scepticism, which we don't share, is related to the company's going into a business outside their consolidation within the ambulance industry,"" said Randall Huyser of Furman Selz.
Houston-based STAT Healthcare provides staffing for hospital emergency rooms. It also offers outpatient medical services such as kidney dialysis.
Industry sources also cited the company's prediction the deal will slightly dilute earnings this year.
In a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, American Medical Response said the transaction will add to earnings in 1997. It also anticipated cost savings of $2.5 million from the merger.
Industry analysts noted that the acquisition marked a logical extension of its existing services by branching out into the hospital emergency room and providing more services for clients.
""They're taking it beyond just driving you to the hospital,"" said Clifford Hewitt of Sanford C. Bernstein & Co Inc.
Industry sources also noted that shareholders of STAT Healthcare were likely to be concerned about the steep stock decline because the transaction was not based on any fixed price for American Medical Response shares. The deal calls for each share of STAT common stock to be converted into one-quarter share of American Medical Response.
Officials from both companies could not be reached for comment.
STAT stock fell 87.5 cents to $7.375 on Nasdaq.
Analysts expect American Medical Response to continue its tradition of buying ambulance companies as it works to integrate the STAT acquisition.
""I think the outlook for this company is very good. There are 12,000 ambulance companies in the U.S. and they aren't geared to the needs of medical care as it is evolving,"" said Hewitt.",0
"The three-year-old partnership between British Airways and USAir Group Inc, already severely damaged by a potential competing alliance, moved closer toward collapse on Thursday when USAir said it was cancelling a key marketing agreement between the two carriers.
Although surprised by the move, industry analysts said it will have little impact on USAir, which received far less revenue from the alliance than did British Airways.
British Airways still retains a 24.6 percent stake in Arlington, Va-based USAir.  
USAir said it would end its code-sharing pact and frequent flier programs with British Airways on March 29, 1997.
Code-sharing is a marketing agreement in which airlines share passengers and extend their reach to destinations they do not typically serve. Over the past several years, dozens of world airlines have entered into such pacts.
The USAir move cames amid increasing hostility between it and its British partner. British Airways earlier this year announced plans to form a massive alliance with powerhouse AMR, parent of American Airlines Inc.  
The move infuriated USAir, which promptly sued the two carriers and contended that their planned pact would undermine the USAir-British Airways partnership.
Although the relationship had certainly turned rocky, most analysts had not expected USAir to sever the tie until the proposed British Airways-AMR pact was finalized. That proposed alliance has raised antitrust concerns, awaits regulatory approvals and is linked to other aviation issues.
""Clearly, it's difficult to simultaneously sue a partner and cooperate with a partner,"" said Samuel Buttrick of PaineWebber.  
British Airways said in London that it would continue to work with USAir until the pact is terminated.
At the time the partnership began in 1993, USAir was a money-losing airline that desperately needed to reduce costs and expand its global presence. British Airways invested $400 million under the partnership, but refused to pump any more money in the carrier because of its poor financial performance.
Since then, USAir's financial position has improved amid healthier times for the airline industry, but its costs are still higher than other major U.S. carriers.
""At the time the alliance was made, USAir received the cash which it needed, but today, it doesn't need it,"" said Glenn Engel of Goldman Sachs.
USAir's future plans are now more uncertain with the decision to sever ties with British Airways, especially because chief executive officer Stephen Wolf has stressed that he wants to expand USAir's transatlantic presence.
""I'm a little mystified. They don't have anything to replace it with yet,"" said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette analyst James Higgins.",0
"One day after rival bidders sent its stock on a rollercoaster ride, Conrail Inc was set Tuesday to formally consider a $9 billion takeover offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
The company's board of directors was widely expected to reject the unsolicited Norfolk Southern offer in favor of a friendly $8.4 billion deal with CSX Corp.
""My guess is, at this point, that they stick with the CSX proposal,"" said Brian Routledge of Prudential Securities .  
Conrail's board was slated to meet Tuesday ahead of a Wednesday deadline to respond to the Norfolk Southern offer.
A Conrail spokesman declined to comment on the timing of its decision, but Wall Street experts expected the company to issue an announcement on Wednesday.
Conrail agreed on Oct. 15 to be bought by CSX in a cash and stock transaction valued at $8.4 billion, or $92.50 per share. Norfolk launched its $100-per-share bid on Oct. 23.
Since then, Norfolk Southern and CSX have vehemently attacked each other's offers and landed in court.  
The CSX-Norfolk Southern relationship between took a new twist Monday when the companies announced they were holding discussions about their bids, but offered conflicting accounts about the talks. Uncertainty about those talks prompted sharp stock declines on Monday.
Industry experts said Conrail is likely to defend the lower CSX bid by citing the strategic benefits of the transaction and the lack of potential legal problems associated with the friendly deal. Legal expoerts have said that Pennsylvania takeover law could impede a Norfolk Southern acquisition of Conrail.  
Experts also speculated that Conrail may try to convince CSX to sweeten its offer in an attempt to appease shareholders who may be upset by the rejection of a higher bid.
Railroad industry experts have said that CSX likely cannot afford to match Norfolk Southern's $100 cash offer, but may be able to restructure the bid to increase the cash portion of the transaction.
""I think it is a strong likelihood that any positive reaction from Conrail's bid toward the Norfok Southern bid will force CSX to sweeten their bid,"" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.",0
"French holding company CGIP said on Friday it could strike a deal in the next few weeks to acquire a 28 percent stake in automotive parts firm Valeo SA from Italian businessman Carlo De Benedetti.
In a meeting with reporters, CGIP chairman Ernest-Antoine Seilliere described negotiations as nearing a ""momentum.""
""In the coming weeks, we could come to a conclusion,"" he said. He said it would be a longterm investment for CGIP.
Seilliere declined to discuss a potential price for the stake owned by De Benedetti's holding company Cerus.  
CGIP's efforts to buy a piece of Valeo moved a step closer late Thursday, when it sold half of its 20 percent stake in Crown Cork & Seal Co Inc for $560.6 million.
CGIP has said that profits from the sale would be used to finace the stake in Valeo.
""Now we have sold part of our assets, obviously we are seen as serious to buy Valeo, but we still have a way to go. We are serious about what we are doing,"" Seilliere said.
CGIP is a holding company with industrial and information technology investments.
Seilliere said the purchase of a stake in Valeo would fit its strategy to invest in firms that have a global presence. Seventy percent of Valeo's business is outside of France, he said.
He also dismissed the potential of Valeo falling prey to the cyclical nature of the autmotive business, saying that opportunities abound in growing economies around the world.
He noted that CGIP previously held a stake in Valeo and sold it in 1993. He also said that the company does not need any significant productivity or organizational changes.  
Although Seilliere appeared hopeful that a deal for the Valeo stake will be struck, he also said that CGIP would certainly consider another investment if the Valeo acquisition falls apart. He did not name any potential companies.
Regarding its stake in Crown Cork, which now totals 10.1 percent, Seilliere said CGIP's relationship with company had not been affected by the partial sale of its investment.
""Our team is still there. Nothing has changed,"" he said, noting that CGIP still has more than $600 million invested in the company.
CGIP decided to sell a portion of its Crown Cork & Seal holdings after investors and analysts expressed concern that packaging had grown to 50 percent of CGIP's assets, up from about 21 percent in 1986, Seilliere said.",0

"Republic Industries Inc., the aggressive Florida company run by businessman Wayne Huizenga, on Friday defended its plans to buy security firm ADT Ltd. after a New York newspaper reported that the transaction would be called off.
""The deal has not been killed. It is still moving forward,"" spokesman Ronald Castell said.
Huizenga, founder of Blockbuster Entertainment, owns the Florida Marlins baseball, Dolphins football and Panthers hockey professional sports teams. Republic has three major areas of business: electronic security, solid waste and used cars.
Originally valued at $5 billion when the stock transaction was announced in July, the deal has lost about 20 percent of its value due to a steep decline in Republic's share price. At the time the deal was first announced, Republic shares were trading at about $29.
Citing unnamed industry sources, the New York Post reported that ADT was expected to call off the deal because of the drop in value.
Shares of Republic closed up 62.5 cents at $25.125 on Nasdaq after trading as high as $26.125 as takeover traders rushed to cover short positions. ADT stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed up 50 cents at $19.125.
Boca Raton, Florida-based ADT declined to comment on the report, but Wall Street analysts said both companies were dismissing the article.
""What ADT has told me is that nothing has changed,"" said Andrew Jeffrey of Robertson Stephens & Co., referring to the report that the deal was dead.
Some Wall Street traders have speculated that Republic may be forced to sweeten the terms of the deal to make up for the lost value in its stock price.
Republic's Castell declined to discuss details of the deal's value.
The transaction also has been clouded by concerns that Western Resources Inc., which owns 23.1 percent of ADT, may oppose the acquisition. Western has said it was not consulted about the merger, but has not yet determined if it will seek to block the deal.
The ADT acquisition represents a huge step for Republic, which has acquired 19 security companies since it entered the industry 10 months ago.",0
"Shareholders of Conrail Inc blasted the company's revised merger pact with CSX Corp, charging that the new terms fall short of a rival bid launched by Norfolk Southern Corp.
In a conference call with Conrail, several investors also threatened to tender their shares for $110 and then vote against the proposed merger, according to market sources who participated in the call.
""Some of the shareholders were really angry and said this was being crammed down their throats,"" said an arbitrager.  
Conrail earlier announced that it was amending the proposed merger agreement with CSX to reflect a premium in the cash portion of the transaction. Under the new terms, CSX will pay $110 cash per share for 40 percent of Conrail shares instead of the previous amount of $92.50.
The remaining 60 percent will be exchanged at the original ratio of 1.85619 CSX shares for each Conrail share.
Based on CSX's current stock price, the deal values Conrail shares at about $93, market sources said.
Norfolk Southern has offered to pay $100 cash per share for all of Conrail's outstanding shares.  
Investors also were unhappy with a three-month extension of the time in which Conrail is locked into the deal. The revised pact says the Conrail board cannot withdraw from the pact or agree to a competing transaction before July 12, 1997.
""It's an outrage. This thing is now locked up tighter than ever,"" said another arbitrager.
Conrail defended the revised transaction by saying it provides more strategic benefits than the offer proposed by Norfolk Southern, said people who listened to the call.
In a move that had been widely expected, Conrail also earlier formally rejected the Norfolk Southern offer.  
A source familiar with the companies involved said the Conrail board met until late Tuesday night and then hammered out the revised pact with CSX in the early morning hours of Wednesday.
Shares of CSX fell 1 to 43 amid broad market gains. Conrail stock rose 1-3/4 to 94 and Norfolk Southern shares fell 7/8 to 88-1/4.
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern described the new CSX offer as ""significantly inferior"" to its proposal and reaffirmed its bid of $100 per share.",0
"Mobil Corp, widely credited with the most aggressive cost-cutting program of all U.S. oil companies, is not resting on its laurels.
The Fairfax, Va-based oil giant told analysts on Monday that it has implemented $760 million of cost savings so far this year as part of a $1.3 billion plan and expects the remaining $540 million to fall into place soon.
Furthermore, Mobil also expects to save at least another $300 million on an annualized basis by 1999 by streamlining purchases of everything from raw materials to computers.  
Mobil discussed cost-savings details after it posted a 10 percent decline in third quarter operating income due to a host of unfavorable conditions, including weak refining and marketing profits. A company spokesman confirmed the figures.
Industry analysts dismissed the earnings drop, saying Mobil's stock price had already reflected the poor industry fundamentals. Instead, Wall Street appeared more intrigued with the company's future cost-cutting plans.
""They have done an excellent job and I think they are determined to maintain the cost cutting,"" said Jack Aydin of McDonald & Co Securities Inc.  
Some investors already have expressed concern about Mobil's ability to keep up its aggressive pace.
""People are wondering if they have squeezed everything out of the cost structure that they can and if their magic touch is over,"" said Smith Barney analyst James Falvey, who upgraded Mobil to a buy rating from outperform on Monday.
Chairman Lucio Noto sought to allay any concerns.
""Since we are in a very competitive industry that has significant price volatility, changes in the way we run our business are essential if we are to compete in the long term,"" Noto said in a news release about the company's earnings.  
Although Mobil is not expected to announce a major restructuring plan anytime soon, future savings are anticipated from purchasing and technology.
""Everybody has cut a lot of the fat and even some of the muscle,"" said John Parry, analyst at energy consulting firm John S. Herold Inc.
And Mobil is likely to soon start reaping benefits of its joint venture with British Petroleum Co Plc that calls for the merger of their downstream  operations in Europe.
The success of the joint venture will likely impact Mobil's plans for future savings as other firms also pursue similar pacts. Texaco Inc, Royal Dutch Shell Group and Star Enterprise are now exploring joining downstream operations. Star is a venture of Texaco and Saudi Arabia's state oil firm.
If other companies pursue such ventures and the BP pact is successful, analysts said Mobil eventually may seek a downstream partner in other parts of the world.
""I think the easy part of the cost cutting and restructuring has been announced. The key is going to be to remain on top of it,"" Aydin said.",0

"CSX Corp may be hard-pressed to top an aggressive and pricey bid for Conrail Inc. unleashed Wednesday by rival Norfolk Southern Corp.
The Norfolk Southern $100-per-share offer came just eight days after CSX agreed to acquire Conrail in a cash and stock transaction valued at $8.4 billion, or about $92.50 per share.
""This (Norfolk Southern) bid comes without any regulatory risk, is all cash and is higher. So it's one-two-three - a knockout punch versus the old bid,"" said Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.  
At the very least, CSX will likely be forced to change its cash-and-stock offer to an all-cash bid if it wants to stay in the game, railroad and merger experts said.
""The Norfolk Southern bid is a very high bid. It's a rich premium and an attractive deal for Conrail shareholders. I don't know if CSX will be able to come up with an all-cash bid,"" said Carole Neely of Brown Brothers Harriman.
Norfolk Southern's bid did not completely surprise Wall Street because the Virginia-based railroad last week had expressed concern about the proposed CSX-Conrail transaction.
But some were startled by the nature of its offer.  
Norfolk Southern's bid aims to lure Conrail investors by offering immediate payment for their stock. It would then place the shares in a voting trust until the deal closes.
""The Norfolk Southern offer takes the risk away from (Conrail) shareholders. You've got to be impressed with that,"" said one takeover stock trader.
Under last week's Conrail-CSX agreement, Conrail shareholders would be required to authorize the tender of 40 percent of Conrail shares for placement in a voting trust. The rest of the shares would be exchanged for stock at a later date and would be subject to market fluctuations.  
Shares of Conrail, which said it will review the Norfolk Southern offer, soared 11-1/4 to 96.
The bid by Norfolk Southern represents its second attempt to buy the railroad that was formed by Congress in 1976 out of the remains of six bankrupt entities. Rumors about Norfolk Southern's interest in Conrail have surfaced on Wall Street periodically ever since it unsuccessfully tried to buy the railroad from the government in the 1980s.
""They're not usually very aggreesive from a financial point of view, but they've been keeping their balance sheet clean for a long time,"" Hatch said about Norfolk Southern.  
CSX and Norfolk Southern are eager to capture Conrail's valuable Northeast presence amid widespread industry consolidation.
Earlier this year, Union Pacific Corp bought Southern Pacific Rail Corp  for $3.9 billion after losing a fight for Santa Fe Pacific Corp, which was won by Burlington Northern Inc for $2.5 billion in 1995.
But unlike those acquisitions in which the target was viewed as a weak market player, Conrail is considered to be a much stronger railroad - a factor that could limit any potential cost savings or benefits to the successful bidder.
""Southern Pacific and Santa Fe were both not doing well and there was a lot of turnaround opportunity. Conrail is not sick. It's not a big turnaround situation and this is not a cheap price,"" said Cornelius Sewell of Argus Research.",0
"- Supermarket chain Food Lion Inc. said Thursday it will buy Tampa, Fla.-based Kash n' Karry Food Stores Inc. in a transaction valued at $341 million.
The two companies had been in talks for a transaction earlier this year, but dropped those discussions in August. It was not immediately known when talks resumed.
Under the agreement, Kash n' Karry shareholders will receive $26 per share in cash. The companies also said Food Lion will refinance $221 million of Kash n' Karry debt.
Supermarket chains have been gobbling each other up rapidly in a wave of industrywide consolidation.
The deal came one day after California-based grocery giant Safeway Inc. offered $2.3 billion for the 65.5 percent of supermarket chain Vons Cos. Inc  that it doesn't already own.
Earlier this year, Dutch group Ahold NV bought Massachusetts-based grocer Stop & Shop Cos. for $1.8 billion.
Salisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion is a unit of Belgian retailer Delhaize.
Food Lion is one of the 10 largest U.S. supermarket chains with more than 1,100 stores in 14 states. Kash n' Karry has 100 food stores and other facilities in west central Florida.
Shares of both companies were halted for trading shortly before the market closed. Earlier, Food Lion shares were up 6.25 cents to $8.56 on Nasdaq and Kash n' Karry stock rose 25 cents to $24, also on Nasdaq.
""This agreement will enhance competition in west central Florida by putting the financial resources of Food Lion behind the Kash n' Karry name, enabling Kash n' Karry to position itself more effectively as a viable competitor with the area's major supermarket chains,"" said Tom Smith, chief executive officer of Food Lion.
Food Lion said it planned to invest up to $150 million to improve Kash n' Karry stores in the next four years, with funding expected to come from Kash n' Karry cash flow from operations.
""While allowing us to continue operating our stores under the Kash n' Karry banner, it gives us access to the capital we need to accelerate our store remodeling programme and grow our business,"" said Kash n' Karry Chairman Ronald Johnson.
The companies said the transaction will increase earnings per share for Food Lion and result in cost savings. They were not specific.
They also said the deal, which is expected to close by early 1997, has been been approved by Kash n' Karry's board of directors. The board will also recommend that Kash n' Karry shareholders support the merger.
Institutional investors who together own more than 51 percent of Kash n' Karry common stock also support the deal, the companies said.
Food Lion said it has received a commitment from Chase Manhattan Bank to arrange and syndicate a new credit facility that will replace Food Lion's current borrowing facility and provide financing for the deal.
PaineWebber Inc. submitted a fairness opinion to Kash n' Karry's board and is acting as financial advisor to Kash n' Karry in connection with the transaction.",0
"The outcome of a bidding war for Conrail Inc is increasingly likely to be decided by its investors, who will ultimately determine if the railroad should strike an $8.5 billion deal with CSX Corp when a $10 billion offer is also on the table.
Wall Street experts said Conrail was unlikely to be swayed from its planned merger with CSX despite a higher bid lobbed Friday by Norfolk Southern. ""Nothing has changed. I think a lot will depend on what happens with the shareholder vote,"" said Jeff Medford of William Blair & Co.  
Conrail has agreed to a stock and cash transaction with CSX valued at about $8.5 billion. Norfolk Southern, which had already outbid CSX, earlier Friday sweetened its all-cash offer to $10 billion.
Shareholders are considered key to the Conrail-CSX transaction because Pennsylvania corporate law prohibits CSX from buying more than 20 percent of Conrail in a tender offer without their approval. A shareholder meeting is slated for mid-December.  
Some shareholders have expressed unhappiness with the proposed CSX transaction. Conrail ""won't win the shareholder vote,"" predicted one arbitrager.
Arbitragers, who have been among the most vocal opponents of the Conrail-CSX deal, said that Norfolk Southern would further strengthen its position by aggressively urging  Conrail shareholders to defeat the CSX proposal.
""It's got to be like Bob Dole's marathon, but with a more successful conclusion,"" said one, referring to the 96-hour campaign blitz launched by the losing U.S. presidential candidate in the days before this week's election.  
Norfolk Southern chairman David Goode declined to be specific about the company's plans to woo shareholders.
""The numbers in our bid speak for themselves. It should be readily apparent that it's a superior offer. We're willing to talk to all of the constituencies involved, including shareholders and others who are interested in this, and we are doing that,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Conrail has said it will review the new Norfolk Southern offer, but the Philaelphia-based railroad also has defended the CSX transaction as a better strategic match.  
""We have high regard for Norfolk Southern and its board, but we simply do not believe that a sale of Conrail to Norfolk Southern is in the best interest of Conrail and its constituencies,"" Conrail wrote Norfolk Southern on Thursday before the bid was raised.
The new Norfolk Southern bid reflects an 18 percent premium over CSX's plan, which values Conrail at about $93 per share. Norfolk Southern has raised its bid to $110 per share.
Shares of Conrail rose 2-1/4 to 95-1/4 after the new bid.
Wall Street experts said Conrail and CSX, which already revised the terms of their transaction once, may feel pressured again to increase the portion of cash in their deal. However, most industry experts do not expect a revised bid to top the offer made by Norfolk Southern.",0
"A threatened proxy fight at Ashland Inc, coming at a time of widespread oil industry consolidation, may force the Kentucky-based energy company to restructure its diverse holdings.
Sources close to Ashland said the company is considering strategic alternatives, although it has not yet determined whether major action is necessary.
Meanwhile, Providence Capital Inc, which has been involved in similar efforts at other firms, is expected to pressure Ashland to enhance its value by breaking up its operations.  
Widely considered a regional oil refiner, Ashland owns 56 percent of Ashland Coal Inc, a substantial chemicals business and a highway construction unit. It makes Valvoline motor oils and owns SuperAmerica convenience stores.
Some industry analysts have said that Ashland, which is trading at around $46 per share, would be worth more than $60 per share if its businesses were separated.
Providence has formally told Ashland that it has nominated a three-man slate for election to the board at the January 30 annual shareholders' meeting. Shareholders will be asked to fill six slots on the 16-member board.  
Ashland spokesman Dan Lacey said the company has hired First Boston Corp to advise it on the proxy issue. A source familiar with the situation said Ashland also may discuss strategeic alternatives with investment firm Wasserstein Perella & Co, which has worked with Ashland in the past.
Sources said New York-based Providence is not seeking control of Ashland, but instead wants to push a restructuring. Founded in 1991 by a group of merger experts at Jefferies & Co, previous investments have included California Microwave, Duplex Products Inc and Ideon Group Inc It also has invested in Russia.  
Ashland earlier this month acknowledged Providence's interest, noting that it holds 100 shares of Ashland's 64 million outstanding common shares.
Ashland has declined to comment further on Providence, noting that it is prohibited from discussing the issue until it files documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a move that is expected by mid-December.
Providence and Wasserstein also declined comment. Sources said both Ashland and Providence recently have held meetings with institutional investors to discuss shareholder value.  
Industry experts think Ashland is primed to participate in industrywide consolidation, especially as Ashland veteran and Chief Executive Paul Chellgren moves into the role as chairman. He is replacing retiring longtime Chairman and former Chief Executive John Hall.
""Under his leadership, Ashland could be restructured along individual lines of business. If done correctly, we think it could lead to an increase in shareholder value of 25 percent or more,"" Bear Stearns & Co analyst Fred Leuffer said in a report issued Monday.
The push for a restructuring comes as giant oil firms join forces to combat poor refining profits. Texaco Inc and Shell Oil Co are mulling an alliance of U.S. refining and marketing operations, while Mobil Corp and British Petroleum Co Plc have a similar venture in Europe.
And smaller refiners also are seeking partners. Diamond Shamrock Inc has proposed a merger with Ultramar Corp, Tosco Corp is buying Unocal Corp's West Coast refining assets and just last week refiner Valero Energy Corp said it was seeking an alliance for its natural gas services unit.",0
"CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp. said Monday they had entered discussions about their rival offers to buy Conrail Inc.
The two railroads did not disclose the specific nature of their talks, but Conrail's stock fell on views that the discussions would dampen the prospects of a bidding war for the Philadelphia-based railroad.
A source familiar with the companies said the discussions began late last week, continued through the weekend and into Monday.
Richmond, Va.-based CSX last month struck an agreement to buy Conrail in a $8.4 billion cash and stock transaction that valued Conrail at $92.50 per share. Norfolk Southern soon launched its own bid of $100 cash per share, or about $9 billion.
Since then, the two companies have been locked in a fight over their rival offers and taken the matter to court.
CSX, which said Norfolk Southern initiated the talks, said the discussions concerned ""a possible sale by the post-merger CSX/Conrail of certain material assets.""
Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern sought to quell speculation that it would abandon its bid for Conrail, saying that it was committed to its offer and has secured more than $15 billion to finance the proposed acquisition.
Norfolk Southern said the talks were started by CSX, adding that they were aimed at promoting competition.
""Our willingness to talk to CSX at its suggestion is consistent with my previously announced position that Conrail cannot be acquired by either CSX or NS without a plan to maintain a balanced competitive structure for Eastern railroad service. While I am heartened by CSX's willingness to discuss these matters, we have no reason to believe that Conrail is prepared to accept that reality,"" said Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Officer David Goode.
A battle for Conrail is viewed as being rife with difficulties for all the companies. Although Norfolk Southern has a higher offer on the table, analysts have said that Pennsylvania's corporate takeover law could be an obstacle to its proposed acquisition.
""This is not a good time to be having a long, drawn-out fight. The quicker they get to this, the better,"" said analyst Anthony Hatch of NatWest Securities.
Conrail shares had partly recovered from the early steep fall by late afternoon, trading down $1.50 per share at $93.75 on NYSE. CSX rose $1.50 to $44.50 and Norfolk Southern gained $1.375 to $90.75, also on the NYSE.",0
"Rite Aid Corp said it plans to swiftly integrate Thrifty PayLess Inc into its already-powerful company by attacking weaknesses in the regional drugstore chain's distribution and technology.
""To make this acquisition work, we have to reduce costs and we have to reduce costs rapidly,"" Rite Aid chief executive officer Martin Grass told more than 250 investors and analysts in a conference call.
In the latest drugstore merger to sweep the industry, Rite Aid announced plans to buy Thrifty PayLess for $1.4 billion.  
U.S. drugstores are consolidating at a feverish pace as the result of pricing pressures and costly computer upgrades that are essential in today's world of managed healthcare.
Industry analysts said Thrifty PayLess has been plagued by a weak distribution system and inefficient technology.
""It is our belief that our technology is a lot more sophisticated than what is being used at Thrifty PayLess and that there are significant benefits that we can bring -- not only to the store operations, but also to the customers,"" Grass said.  
Analysts expect Rite Aid to make significant progress reducing the Thrifty PayLess cost structure even though savings will not come from geographic overlap.  Rite Aid does not have any stores in Thirfty PayLess' West Coast markets.
""No one is as lean as Rite Aid,"" said Eric Bosshard of Midwest Research-Maxus Group.
But the proposed acquisition may create some new difficulties for Rite Aid, which typically has smaller stores and less varied merchandise than Thrifty PayLess.  Unlike Rite Aid, Thrifty PayLess sell plants, ice cream and shoes as well as traditional drugstore items.  
Concerns about Rite Aid's move into these new areas sent the company's stock down two to 33-7/8 in afternoon trade.
""This is something that is entirely outside their realm of experience.  That is a major question mark,"" said Joseph Ronning of Brown Brothers Harriman.
""These are completely different businesses.  These guys are general merchandisers,"" said Gary Vineberg of Merrill Lynch.
Grass addressed those issues in the conference call, saying that Rite Aid may add more merchandise experts to assess the different products.  
""There are certain lines of merchandise that we will continue to carry out West that we don't carry back East,"" Grass said.
Shares of Thrifty PayLess, which made its initial public offering in April at 14 per share, gained three to 21-3/8. Takeover stock traders said the deal values Thrifty PayLess at $23.32 per share.
The proposed acquisition of Thrifty PayLess seems to eliminate Rite Aid as a potential bidder for southeast drugstore chain Big B Inc.  Rite Aid has been viewed as a possible bidder for Big B, which is fighting a hostile takeover from Revco D.S. Inc.
But in announcing the Thrifty PayLess acquisition, Rite Aid also said that it is pulling out of Florida, Alabama and Georgia, which are Big B's key markets.",0
"Russia's aluminium industry, in private hands and learning market-savvy moves in ways its former state owners never could, still holds surprise cards but may no longer terrorise world markets with sudden, secret exports.
Metals analysts said on Friday that Russia, which accounts for about 15 percent of world output, would not cut production or exports in 1997 even in the face of rising costs at home, low margins and weak world prices.
Instead, smelters -- now mostly in private hands after years of turbulent shareholder battles -- would do all they could to turn profits.
""What has happened over the last year in particular is that ownership has settled down so that you can be fairly sure of the conduits of the smelters' metal,"" said a senior London metals trader who declined to be identified.
""They will continue to sell the metal, come what may.""
Russia, fresh off a two-year global output cutting agreement that expired this spring, seized the opportunity to restart some idled capacity and increase exports.
The increases laid to rest market talk that Russia wanted to craft a new output cutting deal to boost low London Metal Exchange prices. But analysts still wonder how much Russian aluminium could flood onto sensitive markets.
Asked if Russia had learned anything from the March 1994 memorandum of understanding that reduced global output 10 percent to draw down bloated stocks, the senior London source said, ""It has not learned. I don't think they care.""
Igor Prokopov, director of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the producers' group uniting Russia's aluminium industry, said 1996 primary aluminium output would rise 1.5 percent from 1995 to 2.79 million tonnes.
Production could rise another 1.5 to 2.0 percent in 1997.
The group put Russian 1996 primary aluminium exports at 2.37 million tonnes, against what it said were 2.11 million in 1995.
""Some noise has appeared in the West that Russia has cranked things up, which is not really true,"" Prokopov said.
But two base metals analysts said the figures seemed on the low side and Russian smelters had undoubtedly increased output.
But they have done so while consolidating sales operations to try to make more money on exports, which has introduced more transparency into deliveries abroad.
Shareholders, many of them Western commodities power houses, were having a greater hand in that transparency, since they were increasingly buying direct from smelters.
Pechiney of France, Glencore AG of Switzerland and London-based powerhouse Trans-World Metals and its units already have major stakes in Russian smelters.
Analysts said the Bratsk smelter, the world's largest, with annual capacity of about 850,000 tonnes, had major plans to modernise with the help of a top European industrial firm.
LME three-month aluminium futures are around $1,550 a tonne, clawing back from October's 2-1/2 year low of $1,305 but below a $2,195 in January 1995, the last major peak.
Prices had been even lower before Russia and five other countries -- the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the European Union -- signed the 1994 accord. The five said Russia was to blame because it had flooded markets with metal.
Those exports were largely orchestrated by the state, which needed cash to fill its coffers.
Now smelters say they are reining in trade and marketing operations to be closer to markets in a way that Soviet-style ministries in Moscow were not.
""Integration could have a positive affect,"" Prokopov said, citing expense rationalisation and consolidated balances.
Russia is an aluminium powerhouse because its Siberian smelters, which account for 90 percent of output, have endless, cheap hydroelectricity generated by rivers.",0
"Russia's state oil holding firm Rosneft said on Friday it would protest against a local decision to award Exxon Corp the right to tap Arctic oilfields, signalling Moscow's tougher line towards Western energy companies.
Rosneft spokesman Vladimir Tumarkin said Exxon, which regional officials declared the winner of a tender to develop the Central Khoreiverskaya oilfields in the northern Timan-Pechora area, would be given too many privileges.
""Exxon's bid violates the terms of the tender in that it would give Exxon the exclusive right to these resources as well as the right to tell the Russian side under what terms it should work,"" he told Reuters.
The protest is the most concrete evidence to date that Moscow, in a significant change of policy, is serious about giving its own oil companies a greater role in developing Russian oilfields.
The legal basis upon which Rosneft -- which bid jointly with a subsidiary and Amoco Corp in the tender -- would protest was not immediately clear.
Exxon officials could not be reached for comment.
""What are you talking about; how can they protest this?"" said Anatoly Kazakov, deputy head of the Arkhangelsk oblast regional administration and a member of the region's Nenets autonomous district tender committee that on Thursday declared Exxon the winner.
""Everything was done absolutely normally.""
Under the tender, Exxon would have a 50 percent stake and conduct negotiations to bring Rosneft, Russian oil firm KomiTEK and exploration body Arkhangelskgeoldobycha in to split the remaining 50 percent in a production-sharing contract.
Rosneft is the state's agent in all production-sharing contracts and has the right to dispose of the state's share of output from such deals.
Tumarkin said that under the original terms of the Central-Khoreiverskaya tender, no foreign firm had the right to tell the Russian side how to work.
""Exxon did not conduct negotiations with us when it bid and its proposal gives it an exclusive right to the reserves,"" he said.
The quarrel over who will develop the fields, which contain about 160 million tonnes of oil and require about $1.5 billion to develop, underscores the ambivalence Russia feels about attracting foreign oil investment.
One the one hand, it desperately needs the money. On the other hand, it is loath to repeat the kind of contracts signed to develop reserves off the Far Eastern island of Sakhalin, contracts in which foreign firms hold nearly 100 percent stakes.
""Fifty-fifty -- what's the problem?"" said Kazakov.""As a Russian, I agree we should support our companies. But if our companies don't have the money or financing, we have to do something else.""
The squabble is the first test of how much more difficult Russia could make it for Western oil companies seeking to tap big reserves.
Tumarkin said Rosneft had wanted Exxon to form a consortium with at least some of the other bidders, including the informal Rosneft/Amoco alliance, Texaco Inc, Total SA of France and Norsk Hydro ASA.
But the idea had received little support, he said.",0
"Russia's Western oil joint ventures are finding it increasingly difficult to export their output in the amounts needed to stay profitable as Moscow seeks to give domestic producers more pipeline space.
Joint ventures (JVs) produce only a trickle of Russia's crude oil -- but they need to export most, if not all, of their output to make money on their investments.
But Russian energy officials, who once courted Western oil majors and independents with promises of tax breaks and priority access to crowded pipelines, are rethinking the terms on which they want foreign oil firms to work in Russia.
""The pipelines are fairly close to capacity, so any increase (in exports) will be at somebody's expense, and that will be the JVs,"" said Julian Leigh of the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London in a recent interview.
Russia's tightening of access to its export pipelines is a barometer of how willing Moscow will be in coming years to let big-ticket foreign investors with planned, multi-billion dollar production-sharing contracts export the volumes they need.
Most of those projects will require new pipelines -- but in the initial stages, they will probably use existing pipelines.
""It's becoming more and more difficult,"" said Igor Ishkayev, Moscow-based representative for the Tatex joint venture, whose foreign partner is Global Natural Resources of the United States' unit Texneft Inc.
""The big companies, like LUKoil, can send out as much as they want. Nobody cares about a little joint venture.""
About six joint ventures out of the 40 or so producing in Russia and exporting have the right to export 100 percent of their output until September 1997. Others enjoy tax breaks.
Most ventures in theory have priority access.
But in practice, they are often elbowed aside from month to month depending on world oil prices, the amount domestic producers want to export and government export programmes.
When asked about priority access for the ventures, a Transneft official dealing with exports, who declined to be identified, said:
""We don't distinguish between oil produced by our companies and oil produced by joint ventures.""
Transneft, the state oil pipeline monopoly, works with so-called designated coordinators -- Russia's large producers, who are often interested in increasing their own exports -- to allocate pipeline space.
""Access to Transneft pipelines is based on personal relationships with the Transneft people,"" said analyst Zarko Stefanovski of T Hoare & Co in London in a recent interview.
""Russian producers are going to increase the pressure to be given more pipeline capacity -- this will certainly be a problem in the future.""
Joint ventures accounted for 4.8 percent of total Russian output last year, or around 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to State Statistics Committee figures, up from four percent in 1994. But they account for about 10 percent of Russia's 2.0 million bpd exports.
""Priority access will hardly be continued next year, which will affect the operations of this joint venture very negatively,"" said Alexander Khrustalov, marketing specialist at KomiArcticOil, whose Western partner is British Gas Plc and which exports about 90 percent of its 25,000 bpd output.
Customs officials, who now make policy as well as implementing it, said in September that some prominent ventures could be liable for millions of dollars in taxes and fines for so-called ""excess"" exports outside their exemptions.
""The issue is not necessarily the length of the tax exemption, it's the intent behind it,"" said one top Western oil executive who asked not to be named.",0
"Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly plans to double exports to Europe by 2010, mostly via its ambitious $40 billion Yamal pipeline project, but energy analysts said the timing could be wrong.
""There's a market problem (with oversupply in Europe), and the cost of developing the Yamal field will be too high,"" said a senior European energy specialist familiar with the project.
""Europe is at saturation level for the next 10 years or so, so Gazprom is 5-10 years too early.""
The Yamal-Europe project envisions building a gas pipeline network across 4,107 km (2,550 miles) from Russia's vast Arctic Yamal peninsula reserves to Germany via Belarus and Poland.
Gazprom wants to take advantage of rising European demand.
To help raise capital for Yamal, RAO Gazprom is offering American Depositary Shares as part of a plan to sell a total nine percent stake abroad.
""Europe can hardly wait for this project,"" said Alexander Litvinov, Gazprom's chief public relations specialist.
A company statement said: ""The company faces significant requirements for capital expenditures.""
The Yamal system, to be built in stages and linking with existing pipelines in some places, would have an initial capacity of 83 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, including around 52 bcm to Western Europe.
Gazprom said the Yamal-Europe pipeline would boost Russia's export capacity to 124 billion bcm by 1997 and 154 bcm by 1999. Sales outside the former Soviet Union were 117.4 bcm in 1995.
The company wants annual exports to rise by 50 bcm by 2010.
Gazprom has won big Western credits to build European parts of the Yamal link into Poland's grid and Belarus, but it has not won financing for the main part of the system or to boost output at Yamal itself, which it hopes to begin doing by 2000.
Pierre Bauquis, special adviser to the president of French company Total SA, told an energy conference in the Kazakh capital Almaty last week that Russia had huge gas reserves but big financial constraints.
""Yamal is not needed before 2010,"" he said.
He said netbacks (a key indicator of profitability) on Yamal gas to Germany today were negative, ""so Yamal is not obvious from an economic standpoint.""
Gazprom sees Yamal as the goose that will lay the golden egg, since the area has recoverable reserves of 10,400 bcm, or 20 percent of Russia's total proven reserves.
But Yamal gas, some under permafrost, is in a remote area and is quite expensive to recover.
Some analysts say it may be cheaper to tap and transport Algerian and Norwegian gas to European markets than to extract Yamal gas in the volumes and time-frame Gazprom plans.
Russian gas already accounts for 60 percent of Europe's total gas imports. Russia has more than one-third of world gas reserves and 26 percent of output, and is the world's single largest producer, with output of 556 bcm last year.
Gazprom accounts for 94 percent of Russian gas output and transports nearly all of it. The firm wants output to rise to 820 bcm a year by 2010.
Russia exports only 20 percent of its output, and declining industrial consumption at home has left Russia with an oversupply. Europe is also flush with supplies, though demand is set to rise.
""The fact that Gazprom does not have its own financing for Yamal and that it has not been able to find domestic or foreign financing (for the main part of the project) speaks quite negatively about its economics,"" said the European source.",0
"Russia's demand for feed grains will outstrip any output increases its agriculture sector manages in coming years, which could turn the country into a big importer, industry officials said on Friday.
Russia, which has just completed its second poor harvest in two years, the third worst in 30 years, is heading into the next crop cycle with few signs that its dismal track-record will soon recover.
""For now, consumption is still low enough to offset the decline in output, but demand is still going to rise faster than production,"" said Alexander Yukish, president of the Grain Union, which groups leading private traders.
Russian farmers have to struggle to get their hands on whatever seeds, tractors and fertilisers they can scrape together.
The agriculture sector, one of the most inefficient and least-reformed in Russia, has not adopted the pro-market changes reshaping some other domestic industries.
""Russia will need at least 120 million tonnes of grain when livestock levels and consumption return to the levels we had in 1990,"" said Yukish. But he said Russian grains output, which has nearly halved in recent years, would not stage a comeback for at least another five or 10 years.
""There is just not enough feed grain in Russia -- we've got to produce more soymeal and maize,"" Alexander Vasyutin, deputy head of the Agriculture Ministry's crops growing section, said.
Russia has been slaughtering livestock because it does not have enough grain to feed it. Bread is a staple in Russia but people are eating less and product quality is patchy.
Russia's just-completed 1996 gross harvest was 74.6 million tonnes, according to preliminary official figures -- just eight percent above 1995's disastrous net 63.4 million tonnes, the worst since about 1965.
About eight percent of the 1996 total will be lost after cleaning -- putting net output at about 68.6 million tonnes.
Some analysts say up to 20 percent of Russia's harvest was lost in the Soviet era due to inefficient, obsolete combines, and that losses now, with even less money for adequate equipment, may still be severe.
""Next year, we'll see the same harvest we had this year, maybe a little more, maybe a little less,"" Yukish said. ""But to expect sharp increases in output next year is not realistic.""
Industry officials said that with the domestic economy showing signs of turning around and a growing middle-class hungry for meat, Russia must act fast if it is to satisfy demand in the future.
Already the signs do not point to big increases next year.
Vasyutin said farmers, afraid of unseasonably warm, dry weather that has lasted into November across Russia's grain belt, had sown 1.2 million fewer hectares, or around 14.5 million hectares, to winter grains for harvesting in 1997.
""Crops are in a satisfactory condition, but moisture levels are not adequate,"" he said, adding government officials had targeted a 1997 harvest of at least 70 million tonnes.""
Winter wheat accounts for about 15 percent of Russian wheat output and can crucially tip the balance.
""Russians want to eat meat -- but this desire has to be preceeded by very serious structural changes in agriculture,"" Yukish said. ""Russia will be a big feed grains importer for quite a while -- of that I am quite sure.""",0
"The head of war-torn Chechnya's oil company said on Thursday that Russia's rebellious region would guarantee the safety of a major oil pipeline across its land but demanded a cut in foreign deals that will use the link.
Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of the Southern Oil Company, which is based in the devastated capital Grozny, told a news conference that an $8 billion multinational consortium that will use the link to export oil in 1997 should not worry because the pipeline was safe and sound.
""We guarantee the link's safety,"" he said. ""But remember that with pipelines all over the world, things sometimes happen -- sabotage, technical errors, human errors.""
He said Chechnya should get a cut from transit fees via the so-called northern link, which can carry 17 million tonnes of oil a year.
""The Chechen part is approximately in the same condition as the rest of the link,"" he said, referring to the stretch running through Grozny and linking the Azeri capital Baku to Russia's Black Sea oil export outlet of Novorossiisk.
The 13 international oil companies in the Azerbaijan International Operating Company plan to reverse the flow of the pipeline to ship up to 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of early oil from their Caspian offshore projects near Baku from August 1997.
The consortium is led by an alliance of British Petroleum Plc and Norway's Statoil.
Protracted bloodshed and instability in the 21-month Chechen conflict have given the consortium the jitters ever since Moscow sent troops into Grozny in December 1994 in a bloody bid to rein in the breakaway region.
The oil firms, worried that exports from their big ticket investments could fall prey to a separatist war, have access to a second export route via the former Soviet republic of Georgia.
Underscoring the fragility of the region for oil investors, six foreigners working with the International Committee of the Red Cross were shot dead at a Chechen hospital on Wednesday and six ethnic Russians were killed on Thursday.
Yarikhanov, who said he had faced a cool reception at Russia's Transneft oil pipeline monopoly, which owns and operates the pipeline, and at the Fuel and Energy Ministry, said Moscow was not doing enough to resurrect the region's once-glorious oil sector.
While he said the pipeline was no worse for the war, Chechnya's production and refining facilities had been laid waste.
At least eight trillion roubles ($1.44 billion) were needed to bring the facilities back on line. Yarikhanov said financing could come from a Chechen cut in the transport fees that the Azeri oil consortium will pay to ship oil via Chechnya.
""We want our share of profits from the transport of oil across our country,"" he said, adding the Azeri group would pay $16.57 per tonne to send oil from its Caspian Sea platforms near Baku to Novorossiisk.
The Azeri oil consortium also includes Azeri state firm SOCAR, Amoco Corp, Pennzoil Co, Unocal Corp, Exxon Corp, Ramco Energy Plc, Russia's LUKoil, Turkish TRAO, McDermott International Inc, Itochu Corp and Saudi Arabia's Delta Nimir.
The Southern Oil Company, also called the Chechen Oil Company, had hoped to stabilise output at three to four million tonnes a year before the breakaway region descended into bloodshed.
Chechnya accounted for one-third of Soviet oil production in the 1970s, or around 22 million tonnes a year, before Moscow began tapping its massive Siberian reserves.
Refining capacity in the south Caucasian region is 20-22 million tonnes a year, but operations have ceased.",0
"Russia's diamonds could face a rocky future with tax officials seeking a bigger cut from rough gem exports, but industry sources said on Wednesday they hoped a deal with South Africa's De Beers would proceed.
In the latest shock to hit the Russian diamond sector and relations with De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd, the prosecutor general's office on Tuesday accused Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS), Russia's largest diamond producer, of financial irregularities.
""Maybe it will affect the (De Beers) agreement and maybe it won't -- my personal opinion is that it won't and an agreement will soon be signed,"" said Pavel Kovylin, first deputy director of ARS's Central Selling Organisation, which handles exports.
The export body has the same name as De Beers's own London-based Central Selling Organisation.
Diamonds could provide a windfall for the Russian tax authorities. ARS is the world's second largest diamond producer and its sales of uncut gems rose six percent in 1995 to $1.38 billion.
ARS, which mines nearly all of Russia's diamonds and is its sole official exporter, reached a preliminary agreement with De Beers' to export rough gems under a memorandum in February.
But the text of the agreement, undergoing review in various ministries, is awaiting government approval.
""The final agreement must correspond to the memorandum, since it was signed by the government and we are obliged to fulfil it,"" Kovylin said.
The prosecutor general's press service, which told Russian news agencies on Tuesday of the investigation, said it was investigating ARS' finances but stressed no formal criminal charges had been filed.
""At this point, there are no indictments,"" said press spokesman Natalya Vishnikova, declining to comment on whether formal charges would be pressed. ""We are investigating and the matter has been passed to the Federal Tax Inspectorate.""
The investigations revolve around alleged unpaid taxes and breaches of hard currency regulations for which fines could total $379 million, according to Russian news agencies. The probe has generated further uncertainty over the relationship between Russia and De Beers.
""There's a whole lot of political infighting going on between Moscow and Yakutia,"" said analyst Roger Chaplin at T Hoare & Co in London, referring to the main diamond-producing region in Siberia where ARS is based.
""It could possibly affect the agreement with De Beers -- but then again, it could be somebody in Moscow trying to throw a spanner into the works.""
The diamond world, recovering from the decision of Australian producer Argyle to say goodbye to De Beers, is impatiently waiting for Russia to finalise its relationship with the South African cartel.
Russia has been accused in the past of leaking hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of diamonds on to world markets outside its previous deal with De Beers. The new deal, once approved by Moscow officials, could give De Beers greater control of Russian output.
But it may not give greater comfort to Russia's increasingly ambitious mineral-rich regions -- especially to Yakutia, which wants a greater cut from exports of rough gems.
Russia-De Beers relations were first hit by uncertainty when Russia's Komdragmet, the precious metals and gems agency which participated in talks, was shut down by presidential decree in August.
Under the February memorandum, which replaced an expired five-year deal, De Beers would take about 85 percent of Russian rough diamonds. That is less than 95 percent under the previous deal, leaving Russia more for its own nascent cutting and polishing industry.",0
"Russia's second-generation, billion-dollar foreign oil projects are finding out that close ties to top government figures, delicate talks with new partners and careful handling of oil-rich, ambitious regions are vital.
Western oil companies eyeing Arctic reserves need close Kremlin relationships and savvy negotiating skills more than ever, now that Moscow has a cooler, tougher attitude toward Western participation in oil production-sharing deals.
Support from President Boris Yeltsin, who oversaw the transformation of the oil sector into privatised companies and who underwent heart surgery on Tuesday, is crucial.
So is a willingness to get out the pencils and redo budgets after talks with increasingly demanding Russian partners.
The factors -- some old, some new --  will decide whether deals stay on the drawing board or get off the ground.
In one of Russia's most prominent projects, Amoco Corp of the United States and Russian oil giant YUKOS are in tortuous talks that, analysts said, revolve around how to accomodate YUKOS shareholder Bank Menatep.
""Any time you add a new player to the game, you need to re-establish what the ground rules are,"" said Dan Westbrook, senior vice-president and resident manager of Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, in a recent telephone interview.
Leading commercial bank Menatep owns a 33 percent stake in YUKOS, Russia's second largest oil producer, and controls a further 45 percent stake formally owned by the government.
The two companies plan to spend $50 billion or so to tap the huge Priobsk oil field, which could hold 610 million recoverable tonnes, in Siberia's Tyumen region.
Russia's first-generation foreign oil deals, all off the Russian Far Eastern island of Sakhalin, took forever to hammer out but largely gave Western partners the leading equity stakes they demanded as insurance for the political risk of investing.
Now, years later, Moscow officials say quietly that Russia should have at least equal status, if not the upper hand.
That makes Kremlin and Fuel and Energy Ministry patronage as important as ever to getting deals to the production stage.
Succesful implementation of projects is still heavily dependent on people at the top, like Yeltsin -- thus showing the enduring power of personalities to moving oil deals forward in Russia, in spite of Moscow's moves to make laws, not people, the framework for investments.
The Timan-Pechora Company, or TPC, which groups Texaco, Amoco, Exxon, Norsk Hydro AS Russia's Rosneft and an exploration outfit in a $40 billion project in the Timan-Pechora basin, saw negotiations temporarily halt over the unexpected death of a key Russian negotiating partner.
TPC President Tom Hazen said he was confident talks to tap up to 360 million tonnes of oil would continue with a special Russian delegation after the Fuel and Energy Ministry selects a replacement for deceased delegation leader Vadim Dvurechensky, who was also a deputy Fuel and Energy minister.
""We are hopeful to continue our negotiations with the special delegation,"" Hazen said.
""There are very few remaining outstanding issues. I certainly wouldn't draw any conclusions that there have been a lack of negotiations or a termination of discussions.""
Both Westbrook and Hazen declined to say when their projects could be finalised.
Western oil companies have a new worry -- the growing demands by oil-rich regions for a bigger cut in deals.
Interfax news agency earlier this week quoted the chairman of the State Duma lower parliament house's Committee on Natural Resources as saying that the Nenets regional Duma had recommended the government break off talks with TPC over regional tax issues.",0
"Russian and foreign oil companies signed a $2 billion deal on Friday to build a pipeline bringing oil from energy-rich Kazakhstan to Western markets, but frantic last-minute negotiations left questions unresolved.
In a delayed signing ceremony that saw Russia's leading oil officials huddling for secret consultations, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium inked documents splitting itself into two for tax reasons.
Russia said its oil pipeline monopoly Transneft might still take a stake. The role of Transneft has been a contentious issue among CPC members and a key negotiating point.
But the signing raised questions over how much closer CPC is to resolving differences and getting its pipeline project off the ground.
""We are extremely satisfied with the commercial structure that has been accomplished and we believe it offers a realistic approach to such an important project,"" said Chevron senior Vice-President Jeet Bindra.
""We are anxious now to move it to the next stage and hope that a share acquisition will be accomplished by February 1997 and that construction will begin next year.""
A raft of officials, including LUKoil President Vagit Alekperov, Kazakh Oil and Gas Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik, Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Anatoly Shatalov, attended the signing.
Chevron spokesman Edward Chow said the two entities -- CPC Russia and CPC Kazakhstan -- would have an identical management structure.
But Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov said it had not yet been decided whether Transneft would acquire the Russian government's 24 percent stake in the consortium.
Chevron will own 15 percent in the CPC, Russia's LUKoil 12.5 percent, Mobil and Russia's Rosneft 7.5 percent each, British Gas Plc and Italy's Agip SpA two percent each, and Oryx Energy Company and Kazakhstan's Munaigaz 1.75 percent each.
The remaining 50 percent is divided between Russia (24 percent), Kazakhstan (19 percent) and Oman (seven percent).
Transneft Chief Executive Officer Valery Chernayev told Reuters that the firm wanted Russia's entire 24 percent stake -- a demand that could delay the project even further.
CPC, set up in 1992, is seeking to build a 1,580 km (990 mile) pipeline linking Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field and Russia's Black Sea oil expot outlet Novorossiisk.
Chevron and Mobil, with a $20 billion oil project in Tengiz, are the main future customers of the CPC pipeline.
Officials signed the deal in a Moscow hotel conference area, but only after breaking out of negotiations repeatedly to run to corners of the room and consult.
""This concludes the first phase of the project,"" Serov said. ""Now a follow-up step, which will be no easier than what we accomplished today, must be made -- project implementation.""
CPC nominated Transneft as operator, but CPC sources said they had a stringent list of conditions Transneft had to agree to and fulfill if it wanted the role.
Serov said Western firms bidding to construct the link would have to do so jointly with Russian or Kazakh partners and said the latter would be given preference as equipment suppliers.
""From our point of view, Transneft has been designated as an operator,"" Chevron's Bindra told Reuters, adding that the group must still negotiate an operating agreement.
""For three years, we failed to find a common language,"" Balgimbayev said, adding that he was pleased with the deal.
The pipeline will initially move 28 million tonnes a year (560,000 barrels per day) of Kazakh and possibly Russian crude and will have a peak capacity of 67 million tonnes a year (1.34 million bpd).",0
"Russia's untapped gold reserves are unlikely to become the El Dorado of the East soon despite Moscow's promises to liberalise the tightly-controlled sector, precious metals sources said on Wednesday.
Russia's Central Bank said earlier this week it was gearing up to create a domestic gold market via measures that would make it worthwhile for Russian commercial banks to finance mining.
But industry sources said the rules would do little to reform the world's fifth-largest gold producer with the world's third-largest reserves.
""It will take quite a while for commercial banks to take much of that market,"" said analyst Tony Warwick-Ching of CRU International in London.
The Central Bank's new rules would allow banks to trade gold domestically in a limited way through special precious metal accounts and to make and secure limited, gold-backed loans.
""Well, if after two and a half years, the central bank has come up with accounting procedures for gold transactions, then that is very good,"" said Yuri Kotlyar, acting chairman of the State Committee for Precious Metals and Stones (Komdragmet), whose functions are being reorganised.
""But this has nothing to do with creating an actual market, and that is what we need.""
Russia's gold mines, even those run by foreign joint ventures, are required to sell their output to the state at fixed prices and are usually paid many months later.
The government, in a budget crisis and facing a tax revenue shortfall, has even less money this year to finance output and 1996 production will not better 1995's poor 125-132 tonnes.
Commercial banks financed only about five tonnes of output last year. Moscow has promised but done little to let banks with special licences take gold abroad to secure financing.
Analysts said Moscow feared losing control of its gold industry, which would be harder to track than other key sectors.
""The history of the (Russian) industry is partly driven by politics, not economics,"" said analyst Andy Smith of Union Bank of Switzerland in London.
Others said a tug-of-war for control was scaring investors.
The Central Bank, which shares responsibility for gold reserves with the Finance Ministry, wants more control over more gold reserves to support the rouble in the future.
But Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Finance Minister German Kuznetsov as saying the ministry, not the Central Bank, should have first crack at buying output and the state, not the private sector, should finance most mining.
Total, unspecified volume of Russian gold mined over January-September was nine-percent below year-ago levels, the State Statistics Committee said. Mining season ends in October as freezing weather emerges in Siberia and Russia's Far East.
And Russia will literally have to dig deep to tap its reserves. More than three quarters of Russian gold is in below-ground ore deposits.
More than half of all foreign-backed gold projects in the former Soviet Union are in Russia.
But none of the big ones, including the giant Sukhoi Log, the world's largest unmined reserve with a possible 1,800 tonnes, are at the production stage because of tax and royalty quibbles with the government.",0
"Russia's grain crop is proving to be one of its lowest in three decades, prompting trade sources on Monday to speculate that the government could return to world markets for imports to feed the military and remote areas.
The nearly complete 1996 harvest, bucking a trend of increased grain output across the world, weighs in at a gross 74.6 million tonnes, with little high-quality bread wheat and virtually no stocks from last year's disastrous output, which was the worst for more than 30 years.
""The figure is, I think, slightly lower than we expected,"" said a Western agriculture source, commenting on preliminary data published by the State Statistics Committee on Friday.
""It means additional imports.""
The cash-strapped Russian state insisted last year it had long ago left world markets for good.
But Anatoly Manellya, head of agriculture forecasting at the Centre for Economic Trends, a think-tank set up by the Russian government, said the Federal Food Corporation, the state agency responsible for reserves to feed the armed forces and remote towns, might soon be in the international market.
""The Federal Food Corporation is probably going to try to do some deals,"" he said, adding only that it was in preliminary negotiations.
The agency has bought a mere 450,000 tonnes of domestic grain out of the 4.5 million tonnes it plans to buy this year.
""As far as I know, the government is talking about possible imports for us, but I cannot tell you anything more since we merely fulfil government orders and they have not yet told us anything,"" said Corporation deputy director Yuri Lysenko.
Russia's harvest last year was officially 63.4 million tonnes and record-high world grain prices kept traders from importing any significant quantities from beyond the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
This year prices are lower after bumper world harvests, with benchmark Chicago contracts at $3.75 per bushel after a long spell above $5 and a spike to $7.50 in March.
But Russian farmers, mindful of recent high prices, have declined to sell to state reserves -- making government officials jittery over how to feed the soldiers and isolated Arctic cities that cannot depend on the private sector.
""It seems like more and more contracts are being talked, especially in the (Russian) Far East,"" said the Western source, who forecast Russia's total grain imports over the 1996/97 crop marketing year from all sources at five million tonnes.
Andrei Sizov of the private agricultural consultancy SovEcon Ltd recently put the total at six to seven million tonnes.
Allowing for the eight or nine percent that is lost after cleaning, Russia's 1996 net harvest will probably weigh in at a lean 68 to 69 million tonnes -- not much above last year.
Manellya said he had told the cabinet last week that net output would be 69.8 million tonnes.
""This is better than last year, but is still one of the three worst harvests in the last three decades,"" he said.",0
"Russia's Norilsk Nickel metals group, a key supplier to world markets, said on Tuesday it was struggling with a shaky financial future despite keeping output steady at its top plant.
""We are undoubtedly in a state of financial crisis,"" said Viktor Feldman, deputy economics director at the Norilsk group.
Feldman singled out the high cost of maintaining social services in the inhospitable Far North of Russia where many of its leading plants are based. ""Our biggest woe is supporting the social sphere, a sphere which, I might add, the government should be supporting,"" he said.
A senior official at the Norilsk combine, the flagship plant of the RAO Norilsk Nickel group, said the facility's output had gone according to plan, with 1996 nickel production at 100,000 tonnes and forecast flat in 1997.
Norilsk is the world's second largest producer of refined nickel, a principal component in stainless steel, and also accounts for about 45 percent of world platinum and palladium production, according to metals analysts.
But First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin was quoted by Interfax news agency on Tuesday as saying the plant might have to issue stock to pay off what the agency said was its 1.7 trillion rouble ($300 million) in debts or face bankruptcy.
Potanin is the former head of Uneximbank, the big Russian commercial bank that controls a 38 percent state-owned stake in Norilsk from a 1995 government shares-for-loans auction.
""We are constantly improving Norilsk's financial situation,"" said Alexei Parshikov, director of Interrosimpex, the powerful Russian group that now handles nearly all of Norilsk's exports and is trying to streamline trading operations to boost profits.
""I wouldn't use the word crisis to describe us, because crisis is when production stops, and that is not happening. We are producing according to plan.""
Norilsk officials have for the first time in years declined to provide immediate total group production results for 1996 and 1997 forecasts.
Uneximbank press relations director Yuri Oleinikov said the group had slightly overfulfilled its plan to boost nickel output by three percent and copper output by six percent in 1996, but gave no absolute figures.
The group's 1995 nickel output was 180,100 tonnes, while its refined copper output was 338,700 tonnes.
About one third of Norilsk's profits go to supporting social services in the expensive and vastly remote Far North, where four of the group's six key enterprises, including the flagship combine, are based.
""We want 1997 to be the year we stabilise, and we are doing a lot to make sure that this happens,"" Feldman said. ""But my position does not permit me to say this actually will happen.""
Potanin said Norilsk, if it did not agree to a share issue to raise capital, would be put in the hands of a special tax commission which could institute liquidation proceedings.
Oleinikov said he did not think a share issue would solve Norilsk's cash problems and called on the government to understand the logistics of producing metal in a frozen, inhospitable section of the globe.
""Our sector should have a strong state role because it is a core industry -- it supports people and, through its exports, the federal budget,"" Feldman said. ""Production will undoubtedly continue normally -- we take a lot of measures to ensure that.
Norilsk ordinary shares had fallen 8.95 percent to $6.00 at 4.26 p.m.(1226 GMT) on the Russian Trading System.
""The state should understand that to demand too much is to cut into production,"" Oleinikov said. ""They will not want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.""",0
"Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes, but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen.
""Norilsk  really is a big debtor, both to the federal and regional budgets,"" said Konstantin Chernyshev, equities analyst at Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher. ""Livshits's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company.""
The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group.
""If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue, then it obviously means something,"" said Christopher Granville, chief economist at United City Bank in Moscow.
""But if it was a response to a deputy's question that was essentially loaded, then it was the only answer he could have given.""
Russian tax and cabinet authorities, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $10 billion, three-year loan to Moscow, have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation.
""They could freeze metal, but it's not a long-term solution to the problem and wouldn't put money in the budget,"" Chernyshev said. ""I don't think they would do that.""
Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company, and Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk's debts.
Norilsk officials declined to comment.
Analysts said the government, while anxious about Norilsk's debts, is highly unlikely to bring the nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output.
But it also wants Norilsk, the world's second-largest nickel producer, to clean up its act.
""The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied,"" Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk.
It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears, which in the past have led to worker strikes.
""It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future,"" Chernyshev said.
He estimated the company's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money.
Norilsk's new majority shareholder, Russian commerical bank Uneximbank, has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues.
But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk's situation.
""Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen,"" said one metals source.
Norilsk said in September that it total debts, including unpaid salaries to workers, were 13 trillion roubles. The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities, after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets.",0
"Russia, dramatically changing its approach to foreign investment in its huge oil sector, said on Monday that new domestic companies, not Western majors, would be given the upper hand in future billion-dollar energy deals.
Vladimir Tumarkin, chief spokesman for Rosneft, the state oil holding company which is being privatised and the state's agent in production-sharing deals, said the days of foreign oil firms winning majority stakes to tap Russian reserves were over.
""We have a new approach,"" Tumarkin said. ""We do not wish to repeat the so-called mistakes of earlier deals, when majority stakes went to foreign companies and Russia was left out.""
He told Reuters he was referring to three, high-profile deals with Western and Japanese oil investors off Russia's Far Eastern island of Sakhalin -- deals in which Russian equity and ownership play a relatively minor role.
As a test of the new approach to Western oil investors, he said Amoco Corp, Exxon and Texaco of the United States, Total SA of France and Norsk Hydro ASA of Norway -- all bidders in a recent tender to develop reserves in Timan-Pechora -- would be asked to form a consortium and to give at least a 50 percent stake to Russian companies.
The companies had bid, some individually, some together, to develop up to 200 million tonnes of crude oil in the Khoreiverskaya Basin in oil-rich northern Timan-Pechora.
""The philosophy behind investing in Russian oil has changed,"" Tumarkin said, adding that Rosneft would hold talks with the companies next week.
Foreign oil investors are already wondering about the extent to which Moscow truly wants outside help in developing reserves in Russia, the world's third largest crude oil producer.
Lots of competitive investment dollars have gone to energy-rich Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, where deals have got off the ground faster and more smoothly.
But while Russia has said it wants to turn around its flagging oil sector, where output has declined by 46 percent since the mid-1980s, its newly-privatised oil companies may not be able to carry the banner.
""The question is, do the Russian companies have the financing for all this,"" said oil analyst James Bunch at Renaissance Capital in Moscow.
Some of Russia's vertically-integrated oil companies have the makings of future stars, with savvy management and reserves that put them in the world's big league. But many of them are weighed down by non-payments and corporate taxes that leave them little free cash to invest.
""I don't think the size of stakes (in production-sharing contracts) makes that much difference to Western companies -- what is important is the economics of the deal,"" said oil and gas analyst Stuart Amor of CS First Boston in London.
He said it was doubtful whether Russian companies could find the money needed in the near-term to work with foreign investors and that crude oil output levels were, as a result, unlikely to rise significantly.
U.S. energy companies have invested less than $1 billion of the $60 billion they have said they plan to commit to Russian oil deals, complaining of political and legal risk.
Prominent projects -- including the $40 billion international Timan Pechora Company deal, and Amoco's $50 billion plan with Russian oil group YUKOS to tap Priobsk reserves -- are beset by quibbles with the Russians over equity stakes, contributions, and asset valuations.
""They're obviously not going to like it,"" said one Western analyst of Russia's new approach. ""But I don't know if it will drive them out.""",0
"Western oil firms frustrated by Moscow's foot-dragging on foreign investment laws presented a study on Tuesday designed to convince conservative officials that Russia will take the lion's share of rewards in oil deals.
The study, outlining the benefits from six flagship production-sharing contracts requiring $129 billion in expenditure, could be the evidence nationalist and conservative parliamentarians need to pass energy and tax laws in 1997 to get the projects off the ground.
Foreign oil firms have to date invested only a tiny fraction of that total, citing high taxes, a flawed production-sharing law and Moscow's inability to ratify a list of reserves open to output-sharing deals.
""No investments are going to happen until there's a firm legal base,"" said a top Western oil executive who declined to be named, speaking after a conference where the study was presented.
The document, prepared by the Petroleum Advisory Forum, or PAF, and a group of Russian academics, said six major international projects requiring $102 billion in Western funding over 57 years would generate $591 billion in total benefits, with Russia getting 87 percent of the total.
The deals would at peak create 550,000 jobs, raise real gross domestic product by $450 billion, boost state revenues by $257 billion and Russian private sector revenues by $258 billion.
The foreign side would reap $76 billion in benefits, including $40 billion in foreign investor profits.
""With the overwhelming majority of benefits accruing to Russia, these projects will make an important contribution towards Russia's future economic growth and to the stability of its emerging market economy,"" a study group statement said.
Conservative Russian officials have blocked passage of key energy laws, saying they want to prevent what they call a fire-sale of Russia's natural resources to the West and in effect hampering Western investment in Russia's oil sector.
""Under the current licensing regime regulating the use of subsoil resources and the current gross revenue-based tax system, large-scale investments in the Russian oil industry are not forthcoming,"" the statement said.
Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Valery Garipov said the study showed the necessity of Western investment in the oil industry, but he said Russian firms would have to have at least a 50 percent stake in production-sharing deals.
""We don't need stop-gap loans -- we need long-term investments,"" he told the same conference.
""Domestic investments are not appearing,"" he said, adding that only Western-financed production-sharing contracts would reverse Russia's steep oil output decline. ""There are Russian banks that bought oil companies, but where are their investments?""
The study said that for each dollar directly invested in the oil sector, an additional $0.90 in revenues would be generated in related domestic industries.
Referring to the study, PAF director Ed Verona said, ""It's a tool to show that this (foreign investment) produces benefits.""
Alexei Mikhailov, a parliamentarian and supporter of Western oil firms, said the six Western-sponsored projects -- Sakhalin I and II, Priobskoye, West Salym, Timan-Pechora and Yuzhnoye Khylchuyu -- could eventually account for two percent of GDP.
Mikhailov said he hoped parliamentarians would pass the revised reserves list and Western-friendly amendments to the production-sharing law in the first half of 1997.
""It is not enough just to provide financing and funds,"" said Dan Westbrook, senior vice-president of Amoco Eurasia Petroleum Company, the partner in Priobskoye. ""The point is, the projects must be economical for anyone (Western or Russian) to do the work.""",0
"President Boris Yeltsin's surgery on Tuesday might be a heart stopper for some volatile commodities and currency markets, but recent history proves Russian oil and gas exports are unfazed by Kremlin dramas.
Traders have seen tanks fire at Russia's White House, cloak-and-dagger power struggles and war in oil-rich Chechnya -- and each time, they say, Russian supplies of oil and natural gas to Europe and the Mediterranean have held steady.
Russia is the world's third-largest crude oil producer and single biggest natural gas producer; its energy heats and powers much of Europe and is a multi-billion dollar cash cow for Russia no matter who sits in the Kremlin hot seat.
This time, with Yeltsin under the knife this morning for a gruelling, hours-long heart bypass, should be no different.
""Politics don't affect us,"" said trader Vladimir Solovyov of Nafta-Moskva, one of Russia's leading oil exporters.
""We are more interested in things like government decrees saying 'export tariff introduced' or 'export tariff scrapped'.
Yeltsin's surgery began against domestic and international worries that if the operation fails, Russia could plunge into political uncertainty that could hit oil and gas exports.
With about one third of Russia's 6.2 million barrels per day output exported outside the former Soviet Union, and with Russian natural gas keeping one third of Europe warm, it is easy to see why traders worry about supply.
But when Russian oil exports do fluctuate, it is on less dramatic events, like storms at the Black Sea export outlet of Novorossiisk, one-off government supply programmes to former Soviet allies and which oil company is flavour of the month with export officials.
Gas exports can fluctuate on occasional explosions in Russia's gas pipeline system, the largest in the world.
Analysts said that with domestic demand flat while the Russian economy recovers, exports will be stable near-term.
Industry sources said there is no danger of conservative officials playing with the taps while Yeltsin was incapacitated, but they said some risk-averse European buyers could insist on contract terms less beneficial to Russian exporters.
""Our partners could get worried and demand terms not as attractive to us,"" said a trade financer at International Economic Cooperation, or MES, another leading oil exporter.
Others said money, not politics, motivated exports -- and with domestic oil prices below world levels, it is not hard to make money exporting the stuff.
""We like good prices on world markets,"" Nafta-Moskva's Solovyov said.
Political tensions in other major oil exporting countries often cause benchmark London and New York oil prices to leap over worries about supply disruptions.
Nervous International Petroleum Exchange traders swung spot prices in London when Yeltsin sacked maverick security tsar General Alexander Lebed last month.
But Moscow oil traders and analysts said that everyone should just calm down.
""This stuff (oil) is scheduled for export months in advance and it's technically very difficult to fiddle with the taps,"" said energy analyst Peter Houlder of CentreInvest consultancy.",0
"Russian oil company officials said on Friday that Moscow would not slap a duty on heavy fuel oil exports this winter, leaving traders to breathe a sigh of relief but still wary of secretive government manoeuvres.
The prospect of no restrictions on exports of mazut, as Russian heavy fuel oil is known, soothed traders who had been worried about short supplies of Russian material, which keep much of European and Mediterranean markets warm.
But while traders said they were now almost one hundred percent certain there would be no export duty, they cautioned that anything could happen in the Byzantine world of Russia.
""I am convinced that there will be no duty -- but I also know how all sorts of unexpected nightmares can happen in Russia,"" said a source at a European buyer in Moscow.
State oil holding company Rosneft's chief spokesman Vladimir Tumarkin told Reuters that a Fuel and Energy Ministry plan for a duty had fallen flat on its face with senior cabinet officials.
""They (the government) have decided not to introduce any restrictions,"" he said.
A second official at Rosneft, which ministry employees said was handling the mazut issue, also said there would be no duty.
""It is safe to say there will be no duty. It's too late. We had all expected one, but it has not come,"" Gennady Grigoryev, deputy head of Rosneft's financial-commercial directorate, said.
The Rosneft officials said Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov -- who had reiterated publicly as recently as last month that there would be a duty -- had failed to excite Kremlin officials with the idea.
""Rodionov was insisting on his position, but there are many corridors of power in Russia and he just did not score enough points with government officials to get them to agree to this,"" one of the Rosneft officials said.
One trader likened Rodionov's comments to ""a soldier's talk designed to pump people up and reflect his interests"".
""It's really possible it's true (that there will be no export duty),"" said a senior trader at a European company.
""But it comes a little too late to make me happy. I'm not thinking about mazut until May or so.""
Russian heavy fuel oil exports tail off sharply in the colder winter season from November to around May, as waterways and export outlets freeze and consumption increases at home.
The mazut export issue was a hot item of debate in government halls, with Rodionov's camp arguing for a tariff to bolster domestic supplies, and those against the proposal saying Russia needed fewer restrictions and more of a market economy.
Traders are conditioned to expect a Russian heavy fuel oil export restriction.
Moscow raised the export tariff on mazut to 16 Ecus per tonne from six Ecus during December 1995 to March 1996 to curb deliveries abroad. It banned mazut exports outright from December 1994 to April 1995.
""Russia has grown up,"" said one of the traders, adding that the decision not to levy a tariff was a triumph for Russia's new market-minded leaders over the old generation.
""I think there were a lot of people in the government who realised that such tariffs are just not advantageous.""",0
"Crude oil output in Russia, the world's third-largest oil producer, is finally ending a decade of dramatic decline, but it is still a long way from switching back into top gear.
""We could see 1997 output stabilise at 1996's level,"" said Vitaly Kamenev of the Economy Ministry's fuel department. ""But we won't see any real pick-up until at least 1998.""
Russian oil output slipped two percent year-on-year to 146 million tonnes in the first half of 1996, after falling three percent in the first half of 1994, according to the State Statistics Committee. Most of the decline came from companies producing over 10 million tonnes a year.
""It is the ministry's opinion that output will fall two or three percent next year,"" said a Fuel and Energy Ministry source who declined to be named, saying that the matter was sensitive.
That would still be one of the lowest declines Russia's beleaguered oil industry has seen in recent years.
It would also be a sign that the era of steep plunges is finally drawing to a close.
Russia's 1995 output of 305 million tonnes, or 6.2 million barrels per day, is stabilising at just over half of 1987's peak of 570 million tonnes (11.4 million bpd).
The numbers matter because they indicate the pace at which Russia, once the world's largest oil producer, may regain that place as its economy and domestic oil prices grow.
But it is still early.
""There are a lot of expectations that the barrier will be broken next year, but it won't -- output will be flat,"" said Tamara Okhundova, energy analyst at the Centre for Economic Trends, a research institute set up by the government.
Moscow is for now committed to subsidising domestic oil prices to help flagging industrial enterprises, and export levels cannot rise significantly until new pipelines are built -- two key factors that do not inspire higher production levels.
""Production next year is going to be pretty flat, and if anything, slightly lower,"" said energy analyst Jeremy Hudson of Salomon Brothers in London.
He said that if parliament soon approved a list of reserves open to production-sharing, an initial, positive impact on output could be felt by the end of 1997.
Russia's joint ventures, which account for less than five percent of production, are showing the biggest increases in output, with their production up 18 percent in the first half 1996 to seven million tonnes.
When the big-ticket joint ventures and production-sharing deals begin producing in several years, total output could soar.
A bull-run in world prices and Moscow's scrapped export duties have inspired Russian producers to put even more oil into already over-strapped export pipelines.
But a tax clampdown on high foreign-exchange earners and a lack of commitment by new shareholders in Russian oil companies to reinvest in production are both sucking up cash.
Julian Leigh, Russia analyst at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, said higher export dollars were not necessarily finding their way back into production.
He said domestic commercial banks, some of which are major stockholders in big Russian oil companies, preferred to pump cash into markets with better returns, like equity.
Rehabilitating wells is one of the fastest and cheapest ways to boost output, but most of the easy, less expensive workovers have been completed and average well production rates have not been as high as expected.",0
"Russian diamond giant Almazy- Rossii Sakha (ARS) said on Wednesday officials were battling for control over Russia's lucrative gem sector but a forthcoming deal with De Beers was in sight.
ARS president Vyacheslav Shtyrov told a news conference that a long-delayed trade agreement with the South African gem giant could be signed by December.
But he said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who could have a chance to sign the deal as soon as this week, would put it off until next month because of a government probe of ARS's finances -- a probe Shtyrov says may be part of manoevres among government officials for influence over the group.
The investigation and struggle for control over ARS come as the diamond company seeks more scope to export independently of De Beers. ARS supplies a quarter of De Beers output, nearly all Russia's diamonds and is Russia's sole authorised exporter.
Shtyrov said that under the trade agreement with De Beers, based on a memorandum initialled in February, ARS would have the right to export $180 million of gems a year independent of De Beers, or 5.8 percent of ARS's $1.38 billion in sales last year.
That could yield a rich trove of influence and power for whichever government ministries succeed in gaining the upper hand in controlling those sales.
ARS, which gave London investment bank NatWest Markets a mandate in July to raise $500 million in capital, wants to increase exploration and mining operations -- giving officials more incentive to grapple for control of the state-owned firm.
""We're very seriously worried about the recent accusations, which come at, and I say this in quotation marks, at an appropriate moment,"" said Mikhail Nikolayev, president of the vast Sakha-Yakutia region in Siberia where ARS is based.
He told the news conference he was referring to the impending De Beers deal and to ARS's plan to raise funds abroad.
The probe, which follows charges from tax officials and the prosecutor-general's office that surfaced last week, revolve around alleged unpaid taxes and breaches of hard currency regulations for which fines could total $379 million.
Nikolayev said ARS had no tax arrears to the federal budget, and that Finance Ministry investigations into ARS finances turned up so-called insufficiencies but no major problems.
""They (the charges) are extremely debatable,"" said Shtyrov, adding that government questions over how to value raw gems supplied to ARS when the company was set up in 1991 were questions for accountants, not for lawyers.
He said ARS would defend itself in Russia's courts if it had to and restore its reputation with partners.
""If the result of all of this is that we lose our investment projects, then we will consider that Russia has lost -- and we will just eat bread and butter,"" he said.
Shtyrov, who is also vice-president of Sakha-Yakutia, said industry officials were struggling for influence over ARS.
Shtyrov said Yevgeny Bychkov, former head of the recently disbanded State Committee for Precious Metals and Stones, or Komdragmet, was still an influential figure in the industry.
Komdragment was broken up by presidential decree in August and the Finance Ministry has assumed its functions.
Shtyrov said Russia's diamond sector would see stability, in spite of plans by some officials to give domestic cutters and polishers a greater cut of gem output.
""There are always rumours of a major shake-up and reorganisation of the Russian diamond industry, but they are not founded,"" he said.",0
"Russia's aluminium sector will consolidate more in 1997 as domestic smelters, perplexed by limp world prices, seek to rationalise costs, a top aluminium official said on Friday.
Igor Prokopov, director of Kontsern Alyuminiy, the producers' group uniting Russia's aluminium industry, said in an interview that domestic smelters were worried about low metals prices, and he blamed what he said was speculation.
""We have been concerned by the sharp fall in prices, which is why we set up the statistical body with other major producing nations to exchange information,"" he said.
""But our conclusion is that the market situation is not a catastrophe. We are not going to stop output and will continue next year with at least our 1996 volumes.""
He said Russian primary aluminium output this year would be 2.79 million tonnes, a 1.5 percent increase on 1995's level, and 1997 production could rise by 1.5 to 2.0 percent.
The group sees Russia's 1996 primary aluminium exports at 2.37 million tonnes compared with 2.11 million in 1995. Prokopov declined to forecast 1997 exports.
Kontsern Alyuminiy said exports of primary aluminium, alloys and semi-fabricated items over January-October had already risen seven percent from year-ago levels.
The State Customs Committee puts the rise at 16 percent.
Prokopov said he was confused by low London Metal Exchange prices and said he saw no basis for weak prices in view of supply and demand patterns.
""I can't prove there's speculation going on, but I look at the charts and these are what the facts lead me to think.""
""Some noise has appeared in the West that Russia has cranked things up, which is not really true. There's no reason for the fall in prices,"" he said, citing lower world stocks.
But he said Russia's survival as an aluminium power was not in question, since the Siberian smelters, accounting for 90 percent of output, had captive, plentiful sources of hydroelectricity, a main cost in production.
Depressed prices would be the motor for Russian smelters to consolidate operations as they completed their transition from state-run enterprises to market-nimble corporations.
""The Russian aluminium industry should be consolidated and act as a large transnational company like Alcoa or Pechiney,"" Prokopov said. ""We won't be like Gazprom,"" he said, referring to the natural gas monopoly. ""But there will be three or four teams that will act on world markets.""
The process has already started. Siberian Aluminium, a so-called financial industrial group, includes Bratsk -- the world's biggest smelter -- and Sayansk, Trans-World Group, Zalogbank, and Kazakhstan's Pavlodar alumina plant.
The Krasnoyarsk smelter is in a group with the Achinsk alumina plant and wants to bring Ukraine's Nikolayevskiy alumina plant on board.
""Integration could have a positive affect,"" Prokopov said. ""It will lead to expense rationalisation, lower costs and consolidated balances. Smelters are in a satisfactory state, but we want better -- we want more resources to modernise them.""",0
"Microsoft Corp said on Monday it had sent the final version of Office 97 -- a product that is expected to be its biggest revenue generator in 1997 -- to factories and will have it in stores within weeks.
The product, a package of Microsoft's top-selling business programs, is Microsoft's biggest new product since the release of Windows 95, and is expected by analysts to increase the company's revenue by about 15 to 20 percent this year.
About half of Microsoft's $8 billion in revenue came from business applications last year.
""People on the (Office 97) development team were jumping in the fountain this afternoon,"" just after Microsoft sent the final version to manufacturing, said Pete Higgins, Microsoft group vice president of applications.
The new version, which had been in development for more than two years, features better ties to the Internet, help tools that guide computer users through common tasks and a new component called Outlook, which manages computer users' documents, appointments, contacts and electronic mail.  
Higgins said the standard edition of Office 97 will cost about $239 for users of existing versions of Office. He said Office 97 will be available on a limited basis in December, and more broadly in early January.
Foreign versions of the product will be available a month to six months later, he said.
Analysts said the new version has several significant features that could goad corporate computer buyers to upgrade.
""It will take some time to catch on because it requires a high-end PC,"" said Mary Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. ""But I think products like these are going to drive PC sales.""
On Sunday, International Business Machine Corp's Lotus Development Corp unveiled its own suite of office applications, called SmartSuite 97, which it said would begin shipping in January.
Microsoft has roughly 70 percent of the market by unit volume, followed by Lotus with 23 percent, according to recent market research data.",0
"Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and warned investors it did not expect to return to profitability until September.
The troubled computer maker attributed the loss to slow sales of its its consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the normally robust Christmas quarter.
Apple's loss, which equaled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales for its first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.
Based on the weak first quarter results, the company said it planned to develop additional restructuring programs during the second quarter with the goals of reducing its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues and enabling Apple to return to  profitability by the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends Sept. 26, 1997.
Previously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March but industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.
""While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,"" said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson. ""We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued to show improvements in our inventory management during the quarter.
""Additionally we saw a 15 percent sequential increase in our high-end Power Macintosh sales,"" he said. ""We significantly exceeded our internal plans for shipments of PowerBooks and expect their availability to continue to improve in the second quarter.""
Nevertheless, analysts said the results, which Apple forecast less than two weeks ago represented a setback for Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996.
""Our expectations now do not show a profit until the fourth quarter, which ends in September,"" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at brokerage PainWebber Inc. in New York.",0
"Macromedia Inc. shares plunged to a two-year low Friday after the software company reported an unexpected third-quarter loss and said it could face weak sales for another quarter.
Some analysts said they also were concerned that Apple Computer Inc.'s declining sales could hurt Macromedia's revenue from sale of software for Macintosh computers in coming quarters.
Shares of the San Francisco graphics software vendor fell $4.19, or 31 percent, to $9.31 in Nasdaq trading -- the lowest price since December 1994.
Macromedia on Thursday reported a loss of $2.36 million, or 6 cents a share, for its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with net income of $7.15 million, or 18 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago. Third-quarter revenue fell 9 percent to $28.1 million from $30.9 million.
Wall Street expected Macromedia to report net income of 14 cents a share, according to a recent survey of analysts by First Call.
Macromedia gets about half its revenue from Director, a computer program that helps graphic artists make animated clips for video games and multimedia software.
Macromedia customers are putting off Director purchases until the company releases a new version in a couple of months, analysts said.
""We are left with the concern that there will be a dip in revenue"" in the fourth quarter as well, said Kevane Wong, analyst at brokerage firm Jefferies & Co. in San Francisco.
Macromedia also gets about 60 percent of its revenue from Macintosh software sales. A slow rollout of high-end Macintosh PCs in Europe led to slow European sales for Macromedia as well, said Ed Bierdeman, analyst at Dakin Securities.
""The Mac market is like a block of ice melting in the sun,"" leaving many Mac software vendors, including Macromedia, to suffer, Bierdeman said.
Macromedia likely will post a small loss in its fiscal fourth quarter, ending in March, Bierdeman said.
Several analysts also said they were concerned Macromedia might not be able to finish the new version of Director until spring, which would jeopordize earnings until the quarter ended in June.
Macromedia officials could not be reached for comment immediately.",0
"Apple Computer Inc. Chairman Gilbert Amelio said Tuesday the computer maker's three-year turnaround plan was still on track despite its statement last week that it will report a first-quarter operating loss of as much as $150 million.
Amelio, speaking to thousands of Macintosh computer enthusiasts at the MacWorld trade show here also called on several star computer industry executives to express their support for the Macintosh.
In his much-anticipated keynote speech, Amelio assured Mac customers the company will have a smooth transition as Apple shores up its finances and overhauls the fundamental software of the Macintosh.
""We will encounter a few bumps on the way, but I don't want that to shake your confidence,"" Amelio told Macintosh customers and software developers. ""We are sticking to our strategy.""
Apple has been struggling for the past year to stop huge financial losses, develop new software to make the Mac more modern and increase revenues. Under Apple's three year plan, it aims to stop financial losses in 1996, develop new products in 1997 and increase revenues in 1998.
Since Amelio became chairman of the Cupertino, Calif.-based company a year ago, he has slashed costs. In December, Apple also agreed to buy NeXT Software Inc. for $400 million to get its help in revamping the fundamental software of the Mac.
In order to move developers smoothly from Apple's current operating system to the new system, Apple said it plans to continue to deliver regularly scheduled upgrades to the current system while accelerating development of a new and advanced operating system.
The new operating system, code-named ""Rhapsody,"" will be based on the merging of technologies from Apple and NeXT.
""Our goal is to be one of the world's strongest brands for consumer, education and the enterprise,"" Apple co-founder and Next Software President Steven Jobs said, adding Apple hoped to rely on Next's multimedia and computing intensive software to accomplish that goal.
Apple said Friday it expected to report a loss from operations of $100 million to $150 million because of weak sales of its Performa line of Macintosh computers. Revenue for the company's first quarter ended Dec. 27 is expected to drop 10 percent from the $2.3 billion reported in the September quarter.
Amelio blamed the shortfall on weak consumer sales for personal computers rather than a breakdown of Apple's strategy.
""We had one thing that really fell out of bed in a big way and that is, Santa Claus forgot to come,"" he said, referring to the surprisingly low sales of its Performa desktop PC line aimed at consumers.
The first quarter ""was about retail sales, not about the fundamentals in the recovery of Apple,"" Amelio told a packed ballroom.
Industry experts say part of the blame for declining revenue falls on the perception that there is not as much software for the Macintosh as there is for PCs running Windows software from Microsoft Corp..
To boost the Mac's image, Amelio turned to executives from Microsoft, Sun Microsystems Inc., and Netscape Communications Corp. to announce software plans for future versions of the Mac.
""We see great opportunities for the Mac in the future,"" said Paul Maritz, Microsoft vice president in charge of application development.
At Macworld, Microsoft introduced its Internet Explorer browser for the Mac.
The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, which has often battled Apple for control of the PC industry, also said it created a new product unit responsible for design and development of a Macintosh version of its widely used Microsoft Office software suite.
While Microsoft remains Apple's great nemesis in the operating systems software business, Microsoft also has long served as the leading independent developer of software applications that run on Apple Macintosh computers.
""When Apple's biggest third-party developer decides to commit new resources to its Macintosh applications business, that's a pretty clear sign that there's still money to be made in the Macintosh market,"" said Jeffrey Tarter, an industry analyst and publisher of Soft*Letter.
The creation of the new Macintosh product unit, part of the Microsoft desktop applications division, marks the first time in the history of the division that an entire product unit has focused exclusively on the Macintosh, Microsoft said.
James Barksdale, chief executives of Internet software vendor Netscape, also said his company will release versions of its communication software within the next few weeks that will run on Apple's next-generation operating system.

"A warning about weak Christmas sales from personal computer retailer CompUSA Inc. Thursday raised concerns that the entire computer industry may have a weak fourth quarter, sending PC stocks lower.
CompUSA, tradionally one of the healthier PC retailers, said it expected a disappointingly small rise in sales in the fourth quarter because of weak PC sales. The Dallas-based company was the third major PC retailer in two weeks to report a weak outlook.
""This is certainly not a good sign,"" said Scott Miller, an analyst at market researcher Dataquest Inc. in San Jose, Calif.
Stock in Compaq Computer Corp., the world's biggest PC maker, fell $2 to $72.375. Dell Computer Corp. slipped $1.875 to $51.25. And Intel Corp., the biggest maker of PC microprocessors, declined 56.25 cents to $130.375.
Analysts said PC companies that make machines geared toward home users, including Packard Bell NEC Inc. and Acer Inc., did have a disappointing year.
Unlike last year, when Microsoft Corp. released the Windows 95 operating system, there were no compelling new technologies in 1996 to drive consumers to stores.
But investors may be overreacting, analysts said. The three biggest personal computer makers -- Compaq, International Business Machines Corp. and Dell -- get only a sliver of their revenues from sales to consumers.
In fact, each of the big three is expected to have solid fourth-quarter financial results because of strong corporate sales.
""Our checks with distributors indicate that IBM is going to have over 30 percent growth (in its PC business) this quarter,"" said Gary Helmig, an analyst at brokerage SoundView Financial. ""IBM's sales are not really focused in the consumer marketplace.""
SoundView Thursday raised its rating on IBM to long-term buy from hold.
Neither Dell nor Compaq are expected to suffer from weak consumer sales in the fourth quarter, either, analysts said.
""Corporate sales are still strong, as far as I can see,"" Dataquest's Miller said. In the past couple of months, many big companies began buying huge numbers of PCs to take advantage of new business software from Microsoft, released late this year.
""The companies that are really suffering now are the ones that are very exposed to retail,"" said Don Young, an analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.
Those companies may continue to have weak sales increases into 1997, while consumers wait for new multimedia PCs to be released, analysts said.
Packard Bell and Acer officials could not immediately be reached for comment.",0
"Apple Computer Inc., struggling to remain the teacher's pet among computer makers, is turning a modified version of its handheld Newton organizer into an inexpensive portable computer for students.
The computer maker on Monday will unveil the Apple eMate 300, an $800 machine that looks like a grown-up's laptop with a keyboard and a flip-up screen, but in a rugged casing that can survive rough handling.
Apple plans to sell the machine directly to elementary and high schools, beginning early next year, as an alternative to personal computers. For the price of a $2,500 multimedia PC, a school can buy three eMates, Apple executives said.
""The federal government says we need to get to a three-to-one student-to-computer ratio by the year 2000,"" said Jim Groff, general manager of Apple's information appliances group. ""I would say the eMate is the only credibled vehicle for accomplishing that.""
More vital to Apple, the product could keep educators from abandoning the company as the leading supplier of computers for classrooms, analysts said.
""The potential for something like this in a classroom setting is tremendous,"" said Mike McGuire, a mobile computing analyst at Dataquest Inc. ""This will be an indication to educators that Apple is one of the few companies spending time extending computing to more and more kids.""
Apple needs a distinctive product to set itself apart from other personal computer makers crowding into the education market, analysts said.
Although Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., still enjoys strong educational sales, sales of IBM-compatible personal computers by companies such as Compaq Computer Corp. are growing much faster.
Apple's computer has always been the favored tool for teaching children how to use computers. But in the face of Apple's uncertain future and a flood of cheap PCs, schools are less likely to remain loyal.
For the 1996-1997 school year, of all the computers that schools plan to buy, 56 percent will be Apple Macintoshs and 40 percent IBM-compatible machines, according to a recent report by Quality Education Data, an education market researcher. In the previous school year, the purchasing plans were 61 percent Macintosh and 38 percent PC.
""The numbers are overwhelming in favor of PCs,"" said Carole Cotton, president of CCA Consulting Inc., another tracker of technology purchases by schools.
""No school district can afford to make a mistake"" when picking computers they will use for years, she noted.
Apple's Groff said, however, that the eMate is not the company's answer to competitors' inroads.
Instead, he said, the device was built for schools asking for a cheap, powerful computer that can offer educational software and Internet connections -- as well as endure rough handling by kids.
""When we introduced the Newton three years ago, it was a solution in search of an application,"" Groff said. Education turned out to be one of the best applications, he said.
Along with the eMate, Apple plans to unveil a beefier version of the Newton MessagePad on Monday. The new MessagePad 2000 features better Internet capabilities, easier connection to PCs and built-in word processing and spreadsheet software.
Analysts said, however, that the eMate is the more interesting device. Teachers and students will like it because it is not as esoteric and hard to run as a traditional personal computer.
""Kids are having to learn more about how to run a computer than about reading and writing,"" McGuire said. ""The ability to have the kid just turn on the device and get right into the writing assigment is really valuable.""
The eMate weighs four pounds (1.8 kg) and fits into a backpack. It can run for a week on rechargeable batteries, according to Apple.
The machine features a built-in word processor, drawing and equation-drawing programs and an address book. With an optional modem and software, students can browse the Internet.
Still, the eMate could be a tough sell for Apple.
Because its software is based on the Newton operating system, it cannot run the thousands of educational programs written for the Macintosh and for PCs running Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software.
Apple executives are confident, however, that the eMate will help the company place more its computers on students' desks.
""There's 52 million screaming (grades) K-to-12 children to sell to,"" said Robert Kondrk, Apple's manager of education product lines. ""We've known for years this is an opportunity, but we didn't have the technology to do it before. We do now.""",0
"Synopsys Inc. said Thursday it agreed to buy Epic Design Technology Inc. for about $428.1 million in stock to gain expertise in a hot niche of the semiconductor design business.
Synopsys, which writes software to help engineers design computer chips, said it will issue 0.7485 of its shares for each of Epic's 13.7 million shares outstanding. Based on Synopsys's closing stock price of $41.75 on Wednesday, Synopsys would pay about $31.25 for each Epic share.
Shares of Epic, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 87.5 cents to $31 in late Nasdaq trading. Shares of Synopsys, based in Mountain View, Calif., were unchanged at $41.75, also on Nasdaq.
Synopsys specialises in software used in designing the overall framework of a microchip. Epic specialises in software for designing individual microscopic circuits, millions of which make up the microchip.
The acquisition gives Synopsys an edge as the so-called design automation industry scrambles to come up with ways to help engineers design ever smaller chips, analysts said.
""We believe the Epic acquisition is a good strategic move,"" said Raj Seth, analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston. ""Synopsys picks up technologies that are increasingly critical to developing"" the tiny ""deep submicron"" circuits.
Synopsys' customers, which include some of the world's biggest chip makers, have been asking for a suite of design software that would let engineers design a chip's framework as well as its circuits, said Aart de Geus, Synopsys chief executive.
Epic will become a unit of Synopsys, the companies said. Sang Wang, Epic chairman and CEO, will head the unit.
Synopsys will take an undetermined charge for the acquisition in the quarter the transaction is done, ""ideally March,"" said Brooke Seawell, Synopsys chief financial officer. Because of little overlapping products, there should be no Epic job cuts, Seawell said.",0
"A motto of Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., has been: ""A computer on every desk running Microsoft software.""
With that goal almost accomplished, Microsoft executives have set their sights on other flat surfaces, such as the kitchen counter, the living room's entertainment console and the back of airline seats.
At a Los Angeles conference for professional programmers, Microsoft executives outlined the company's plans to take its Windows family of operating systems into more types of computers, such as subway token vending machines, handheld portables and arcade video games.
The company also said it plans to spend much of its research and development budget to automate management tasks of personal computers and to simplify the machines' operations.
In recent weeks, Microsoft's competitors Sun Microsystems Inc. and Oracle Corp. have outlined their plans to build new types of computers, called network computers, that are simpler and cheaper to use than personal computers.
At Monday's Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft executives said future versions of its Windows -- which control about 80 percent of the world's desktop computers -- will do the same things.
""We are focusing now on the investments people have put in their computing technology and on increasing their returns,"" said Paul Maritz, Microsoft group vice president.
Maritz demonstrated software products that can recognize spoken commands. He also demonstrated programs that automatically take care of network chores without human help.
Features like these will help companies get more out of their investment in Microsoft products already in place, Maritz said.
He also demonstrated how programmers can use Windows in non-traditional types of computers. He showed a bullet-proof vending machine for New York subways that uses Windows software to dispense fares on smart cards.",0
"Apple Computer Inc. stunned investors Wednesday by reporting an unexpected $25 million fourth quarter profit, stemming a year of management turmoil and swelling red ink.
The Cupertino, Calif.-based computer maker, which had been expected to report a loss of 30 cents a share, posted a profit of 20 cents a share for the last three months of fiscal 1996, its first quarterly profit this year.
In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $60 million, or 48 cents per share. Included in the most recent quarter's operating results was a gain of $17 million.
Fourth-quarter revenue for fiscal 1996 declined 23 percent to $2.32 billion from $3 billion.
Apple released the news after the market closed and its shares jumped as much as $4.25 to $30 a share in after-hours trading.
Industry analysts attributed the profit to Apple's aggressive cost cutting, a bigger-than-expected exodus of employees and lower prices for key components, such as memory chips.
""It is a shock,"" said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst at JP Morgan in San Francisco who was expecting a loss. ""It seems they've brought the break-even point for their business down pretty dramatically. This is very encouraging.""
Most important to investors, Apple could remain profitable in coming quarters, which would bolster confidence among consumers that it will be around for years and keep loyal customers from switching to IBM-compatible personal computers, analysts said.
Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, stopped short of predicting a profit in the first fiscal quarter.
He said, however, that he expects the company's costs to increase only slightly in the December quarter on higher advertising expenses and that first-quarter revenue should be about the same as in the fourth fiscal quarter.
""We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests,"" Anderson said.
""We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments,"" he said in a statement.
In the previous three quarters, Apple reported huge losses because of declining Macintosh sales, management turmoil and growing popularity of personal computers running Microsoft's Windows software, which compete with Macintosh.
The company began slashing its costs when former National Semiconductor Corp. chief Gilbert Amelio took charge of Apple in February.
With most of the cost-cutting plan completed, Apple now will concentrate on the much tougher task of increasing revenue, Anderson said.
While shipments were down 26 percent in the fourth quarter to 932,000 units from the year-ago quarter, Apple said shipments were up 11 percent from the third quarter, a sign that customers were once again buying Apple's products.
Apple has a slew of new products in the works.
On Monday, the company is expected to unveil a new low-end PowerBook, a much-needed portable computer to replace Apple's older glitch-prone models.
In the first calendar quarter, the company also is expected to introduce new low-end consumer desktop models, a niche from which Apple had retreated in an effort to cut costs.
For the full year, Apple reported a loss of $816 million, or $6.59 a share, reflecting a series of hefty one-time charges for inventory writedowns and restructurings. In fiscal 1995, Apple earned $424 million, or $3.45 a share.
Revenue for the year fell 11 percent to $9.83 billion from $11.1 billion a year ago.",0
"Most U.S. software publishers are expected to report only modest increases in their third-quarter earnings, reflecting a seasonal slowdown and a lack of new products this quarter.
""For the behemoths of the industry, like Microsoft (Corp) and Oracle (Corp ), business is still good,"" said Marshall Senk, an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co in San Francisco. ""Summer is the slow buying season for most of the industry,"" but setting aside the seasonal slowing, ""business is still pretty okay.""  
Analysts expect Microsoft, the world's biggest personal computer software publisher, to report substantially higher earnings for its first quarter of fiscal 1997 on the back of strong sales of its networking software and business programs. Microsoft is scheduled to report results on Oct. 21.
Better-than-expected sales of personal computers in the past few months also will contribute to Microsoft's revenue, analysts said. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., makes about a quarter of its revenue from the sale of its Windows family of operating systems.  Operating systems are the type of software that controls the basic functions of every PC.  
Microsoft benefits from strong PC sales because PC makers have to pay Microsoft a royalty for every copy of Windows they pack in the boxes of new machines.
Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $0.90 a share, according to a survey of 24 analysts by First Call.  In the same quarter a year ago, Microsoft earned $0.78.
Novell Inc, the biggest publisher of computer networking software, is not expected to perform as well.  
The company is struggling to sell its NetWare flagship -- which controls the flow of computer information through departmental computer departments -- in the face of competition with Microsoft's Windows.  Novell, based in Provo, Utah, also still faces management issues following the resignation of Bob Frankenberg, the former chief executive officer, said David Takata, an analyst at Gruntal & Co in Los Angeles.
""They clearly still have a lot of work to do"" to get the company's management in order, Takata said.  
Novell is expected to earn $0.18 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $0.16 a year ago, according to a First Call survey of 17 analysts.
Meanwhile, vendors of software for large, corporate computer networks and database management tools are expected to continue to post substantial gains in the third quarter on continuing strong demand.
""For a relatively mature market, this niche is still growing at a good clip,"" said Jim Pickrel, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.  
Pickrel said he expects Oracle and Informix Corp to report the most impressive results on strong sales of their database software -- computer programs which help big companies keep track of huge libraries of corporate information.  Both are taking business from Sybase Inc,  another database software publisher, which is still struggling to recover from marketing and technical shortcomings last year.
Sybase,is expected to report it broke even in the quarter, not counting charges for a restructuring, Pickrel said.  In the year-earlier quarter, Sybase earned $0.01 a share.  
Oracle, the biggest database software publisher, is expected to earn $0.27 a share for the fiscal second quarter ending November, according to a recent survey of 27 analysts by First Call.  A year ago in the same quarter, it earned $0.21.
Hambrecht & Quist's Pickrel said Informix could pass Sybase this quarter in revenue to become the second biggest database vendor.  Informix is expected to earn $0.18 a share, according to a First Call survey of 25 analysts.  In the same quarter a year ago, Informix earned $0.16.",0
"Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in its fiscal first quarter and warned investors it did not expect to report a profit until September.
The troubled computer maker, based in Cupertino, Calif., also said it expected revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends next September, to drop about 13 percent to $8 billion to $8.5 billion because of weak consumer sales.
Apple's loss, which equaled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.
Apple attributed the latest quarterly loss to slow sales of consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the crucial Christmas quarter, which analysts said was partly due to concerns about Apple's future.
""Apple's been under a black cloud, and part of it has been Apple's doing,"" said Lou Mazzucchelli, analyst at brokerage Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. ""It's hard for a consumer to get the gumption to buy a Performa when everyone's asking, 'Is Apple dead yet?'""
Apple officials said the company will unveil in coming weeks its second restructuring program in two years, aimed at cutting operating costs by $400 million.
The plan could include more job cuts, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson said. Apple wants to reduce its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues to enable it to return to profitability by the end of September.
Previously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March. But industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.
Apple, which posted a record loss last year of $816 million, has been struggling to return to profitability in the face of increased competition from computers using Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system and Intel Corp.'s computer chips.
Last February, Apple replaced Chief Executive Michael Spindler with National Semiconductor Corp. boss Gilbert Amelio and then, in December, announced a reunion with former co-founder Steven Jobs when it agreed to acquire Job's Next Software Inc. for $400 million.
Meanwhile, debt rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Apple's corporate credit and debt rating another notch Wednesday, putting the company's debt further into junk bond status.
The rating agency said the downgrade reflected the challenges facing Apple, including reducing costs and restoring revenue growth, executing a cohesive operating system upgrade upon completion of the Next acquisition, and Apple's diminished liquidity and financial resources.
""Despite its position among the top five worldwide personal computer manufacturers ... Apple has been struggling with extremely competitive industry conditions, slipping market share, and operating losses,"" the rating agency said.
Despite the slowdown in Performa sales, Anderson said Apple's financial position remained strong.
""While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,"" he said. ""We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash.""
Anderson said there were some bright spots in its results. European shipments rose 50 percent in the first quarter from the fourth quarter. Sales to educational organizations also were above the company's goals, Anderson said.
Still, Performa sales, which account for about a third of Apple's revenues, will be weak for the rest of the year. ""We had a major problem in this one product area,"" he said.
Analysts said the loss, which Apple forecast two weeks ago, represented a setback for Amelio. He had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996 and getting revenue growing again by 1998.
News of the latest loss can drive even more consumers to avoid buying Apple products, analysts said.
""The question is, can Apple wait until 1998 to get its growth engine going again?"" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at broker PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
Apple reported its results after the market closed. Apple closed at $17.25 a share, down 62.5 cents, on Nasdaq.",0
"Database software company Informix Corp. said Friday it filed a lawsuit against Oracle Corp., accusing its bigger rival of stealing trade secrets by hiring away its employees.
Oracle hired 11 Informix employees from Informix's Portland, Ore., research and development centre. All 11 workers quit on Wednesday morning, said Informix Chief Executive Phil White.
Informix stock fell $1.50, or 6.6 percent, to $21.375 in active trading on Nasdaq. Oracle stock fell 87.5 cents to $39.625, also on Nasdaq.
""This is a blatant effort by Oracle,"" said White. ""They're behind significantly technically. We're not going to let someone who's significantly behind technically just buy his way in.""
Oracle officials called the lawsuit ""ridiculous"" and said the 11 programmers approached Oracle on their own. They also had approached Microsoft Corp. about jobs, said Jerry Held, Oracle senior vice president of server technologies.
""This is a group of senior developers that was very frustrated by the lack of vision of Informix top managers,"" Held said. ""We did no active recruiting. I was called absolutely out of the blue"" when the former Informix staff joined Oracle.
The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in Oregon Circuit Court in Portland, seeks unspecified damages. Informix on Thursday also obtained a temporary injunction barring the former employees from giving trade secrets to Oracle, Informix said.
Informix also charged Gary Kelley, a former Informix product development vice president who left for Oracle, with breach of contract. Kelley did not return phone calls to Oracle's Portland facility.
Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., and Oracle, based 20 miles north in Redwood Shores, Calif., both write sophisticated programmes that store and retrieve huge amounts of information in corporate computer networks.
The companies for years have been fighting a marketing war touting their advances in database technology with each new release of their respective flagship products.
White said he believed Oracle was interested in gaining Informix's expertise in writing software for so-called massively parallel computers -- top-of-the-line machines that can process huge amounts of transactions simultaneously.
The 11 Informix employees who left for Oracle were working on this type of product, White said.
Held said Oracle does not have an interest in Informix's technology because Oracle is ahead in that area.
""Oracle has had parallel technology for years,"" Held said. ""Informix is playing catch-up. Phil has a knack for being behind and saying he's ahead.""
Technology debates aside, the spat is the most serious between the companies in years. White, normally a publicity-shy executive, said he was livid about Oracle's tactics and intended to make the lawsuit a political cause in Silicon Valley for preventing employee raids.
White said he personally went to the home of Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison on Thursday night to discuss the issue, but Ellison was in Hong Kong. Both men live in the same small town in Silicon Valley.
""I'm doing this not only for Informix and for our shareholders but also for the industry,"" White said. ""We can't let companies come in and throw big financial incentives and walk away with intellectual property we spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing.""
In recent years, several software rivals in Silicon Valley have accused each other of trade secret theft by employee snatching.
In 1992, Borland International Inc. accused a former employee of sending confidential electronic mail to new employer Symantec Corp.. Last year, Cadence Design Systems Inc.. filed a similar charges against direct competitor Avant Corp..
The court has set a hearing in the Informix case for Feb. 7.",0
"Cisco Systems Inc. said Tuesday its fiscal first quarter profit from operations rose 77 percent, reflecting strong sales of its computer networking equipment.
The company, which makes devices that control the flow of information between computers in a network, said earnings before gains and charges rose to $320.8 million, or 47 cents a share, for the three months ended Oct. 26, from $181.4 million or 28 cents in the same quarter a year ago.
Net income for the quarter, after taking into account a $174.6 million charge for the acquisition of Telebit Corp. and a $55.1 million gain from the sale of a minority investment, totaled $180.9 million, or 26 cents a share, slightly lower than the year-ago figure.
Revenues jumped 80 percent to $1.43 billion from $798.3 million.
Wall Street had expected Cisco, the world's biggest computer networking company and a bellwhether technology stock, to report a profit from operations of 46 cents, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
Analysts said the company had a solid quarter, alleviating concerns in recent weeks about slowing sales of networking equipment.
""They surprised us on the revenue,"" said Eric Blachno, analyst at Bear Stearns in New York. ""It was a little higher than we thought.""
Cisco also managed to keep its gross margins -- a measure of how much profit a company makes from each dollar of sales -- at 65 percent, better than analysts had expected.
Cisco, based in San Jose, Calif., attributed the higher profits to strong sales across all its product lines.
""More of our customers are beginning to look at a single vendor"" for all of their networking needs, said John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive.
The company reported its results after the market closed. For the day, the stock had gained $1.125 to close at $61.75. After the earnings release, the shares slipped 25 cents to $61.50 in after-hour trading.
Analysts said some investors may have been disappointed that Cisco's earnings per share were not higher. Frequently, Cisco reports per-share results that are at least 3 or 4 cents above forecasts.",0
"Microsoft Corp. Monday will unveil a set of software technologies that lets programmers more easily create software for sharing information through corporate and public computer networks.
Microsoft executives, including Chairman Bill Gates, also will discuss at an event in Los Angeles development plans for the company's Windows family of operating systems, the company said Friday.
At one of its periodic Professional Developers Conferences, Microsoft executives will encourage programmers to write commercial software based on Microsoft's standards.
Microsoft's event will be held the same week Oracle Corp., Microsoft's biggest rival in the corporate software business, is holding a conference in San Francisco to pitch its own approach to writing programmes for shuffling information through huge networks.
Both companies in recent months have been retooling their key applications and networking software to work on the Internet's World Wide Web and internal corporate networks called intranets.
Writing even simple programmes to let computer users collaborate on documents through networks tradionally has required intimate knowledge of difficult programming techniques.
The technology Microsoft will unveil on Monday will relieve programmers of the need to know the secret handshakes of its Windows operating systems, said Tanya van Dam, a Microsoft group product manager.
The move would encourage developers to base more of their commercial products on Microsoft's Windows NT networking operating system, analysts said.
Oracle has a similar aim.
On Monday, the company will unveil its own tools for writing intranet software for tapping information stored in Oracle databases, Oracle executives said.
Corporate programmers have written huge libraries of financial, manufacturing and human resources software using Oracle's products. The new programming tools would let programmers easily convert the libraries to work on the Web, Oracle said.",0
"Apple Computer Inc. said Thursday it will cut U.S. prices of its Power Macintosh personal computers by as much as 30 percent to make the machines more competitive with those from rival PC makers.
The price cuts are part of Apple's effort to make its machines as attractive as so-called Wintel PCs -- machines based on Intel Corp. microprocessors running Microsoft Corp Windows software.
Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said it will reduce the price of its high-end Power Macintosh 9500/200 to about $4,200 from $4,900.
The price of the entry-level Power Macintosh 7200/120 business machine will be cut to about $1,600 from $2,300, the company said. The price reductions, which will be effective Nov. 2, range from 9 percent to 30 percent.
Apple can afford the price cuts because it has reduced its costs significantly since a restructuring effort began nine months ago, said Byran Longmire, a Power Macintosh product manager at Apple.
""It shows that we can take aggressive pricing actions across many of our product lines and still maintain a healthy business,"" Longmire said.
Apple's computers have traditionally been priced higher than PCs with similar features made by companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and Compaq Computer Corp.
With the release of Microsoft's Windows 95 program a year ago, Apple lost much of its bragging rights for ease-of-use and saw many of its customers flee to the IBM-compatible world. In the past year, the company reported more than $800 million in losses amid falling sales.
To make its machines more attractive, Apple has had to cut its prices to keep customers from defecting.
""Now when a business customer does a feature-for-feature comparison between a Power Macintosh and a Wintel machine, that customer will find the Power Macintosh competitively priced,"" Gary Little, Apple's senior vice president of the Power Macintosh division, said in a statement.
The price cuts should help Apple increase the momentum it has gained in recent weeks, analysts said. Earlier this month, Apple reported an unexpected profit in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.
The price cuts will not ""take Apple out of the hole, but we're seeing a more aggressive Apple, which is good news,"" said Scott Miller, an analyst at market researcher Dataquest Inc. The price cuts and the news about better financial health could convince more customers sitting on the fence to buy an Apple, Miller said.",0
"Synopsys Inc. said Thursday it agreed to buy Epic Design Technology Inc. for about $428.1 million in stock to gain expertise in a hot niche of the semiconductor design business.
Synopsys, which writes software to help engineers design computer chips, said it will issue 0.7485 of its shares for each of Epic's 13.7 million shares outstanding. Based on Synopsys's closing stock price of $41.75 on Wednesday, Synopsys would pay about $31.25 for each Epic share.
Shares of Epic, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 87.5 cents to $31 in late Nasdaq trading. Shares of Synopsys, based in Mountain View, Calif., were unchanged at $41.75, also on Nasdaq.
Synopsys specializes in software used in designing the overall framework of a microchip. Epic specializes in software for designing individual microscopic circuits, millions of which make up the microchip.
The acquisition gives Synopsys an edge as the so-called design automation industry scrambles to come up with ways to help engineers design ever smaller chips, analysts said.
""We believe the Epic acquisition is a good strategic move,"" said Raj Seth, analyst at Cowen & Co. in Boston. ""Synopsys picks up technologies that are increasingly critical to developing"" the tiny ""deep submicron"" circuits.
Synopsys' customers, which include some of the world's biggest chip makers, have been asking for a suite of design software that would let engineers design a chip's framework as well as its circuits, said Aart de Geus, Synopsys chief executive.
Epic will become a unit of Synopsys, the companies said. Sang Wang, Epic chairman and CEO, will head the unit.
Synopsys will take an undetermined charge for the acquisition in the quarter the transaction is done, ""ideally March,"" said Brooke Seawell, Synopsys chief financial officer. Because of little overlapping products, there should be no Epic job cuts, Seawell said.",0
"The lean times for the video game software industry appear to be over.
Three of the largest game developers on Thursday reported results for the crucial December quarter that were better than Wall Street expected.
Electronic Arts Inc., Activision Inc. and Spectrum Holobyte Inc. said strong sales of games for personal computers and next-generation video game consoles, such as the Sony PlayStation, contributed to the strong results.
For the past year, the video game software industry had been in a funk while consumers waited for the release of advanced game machines from Sony Corp., Sega Enterprises and Nintendo Corp. The industry also lacked blockbusters to draw customers to the video game isle at stores.
The release of the PlayStation last year and the Nintendo 64 this year has revitalized the industry, analysts said.
""People are underestimating how truly red hot sales of the video game systems are,"" said David Farina, an analyst at brokerage William Blair & Co. in Chicago. ""If history is any guide, we're in for a strong two-year cycle for my investors, cross my finger.""
After the market closed, Electronic Arts, the biggest U.S. game publisher, said net income for its fiscal third quarter, ended Dec. 31, rose 25 percent to $36.7 million, or 66 cents a share, from $29.3 million, or 54 cents, in the same quarter a year ago.
Electronic Arts' revenue in the quarter jumped 13 percent to $271.1 million from $240.1 million on strong sales of games for the PlayStation and PCs, the company said.
Activision, another big game vendor, said net income in its Christmas quarter more than doubled to $4.12 million, or 28 cents, from $1.95 million, or 13 cents, a year ago.
Spectrum Holobyte, based in Alameda, Calif., said net income in the December quarter was $5.7 million, or 20 cents a share, more than double the 9 cents Wall Street expected. In the same quarter last year, Spectrum Holobyte had a loss of $9.95 million, or 41 cents a share.
The strong earnings likely will continue into the March quarter, analysts said, as consumers buy a new generation of PCs based on Intel Corp.'s MMX technology, which soups up the graphics capabilities of the machines.",0
"When Apple Computer Inc. fired co-founder Steven Jobs in 1985, Apple employees did not know whether to cry or to rejoice.
Through the early 1980s, Jobs had inspired Apple engineers to create a computer called the Macintosh which would change the world. At the same time, though, Jobs and his mercurial temper burned out many of the same engineers who adorded him.
On Friday, more than 11 years after Jobs was ousted in a stunning boardroom coup, Apple took a huge gamble by bringing him back.
His assignment is to help the Cupertinto, California-based computer company revamp the software behind the Macintosh, an effort that had been mired for three years.
The bet is that Jobs is the only person who can inspire Apple's demoralized programmers to create software that would leapfrog Microsoft Corp's competing Windows operating system.
""He will help tremendously,"" said Randy Wigginton, a former Apple programmer who worked under Jobs to write the software of the original Mac. ""Steve is incredibly bright, talented, amusing.""
On Friday, as word of Apple's decision to rehire Jobs spread, shares of the company rose $1.25 or 5.6 percent, to $23.50.
Job's new company, NeXT Software Inc., which Apple agreed to acquire on Friday for $400 million, offers a computer operating system that has many of the software bells and whistles Apple has been looking for to catch up with rival Microsoft.
Apple had tried to reach a deal with closely held software company Be Inc., founded by another former Apple executive, Jean-Louis Gassee, but the talks broke down and the company turned to Jobs for help.
With NeXT's existing technology, Apple hopes to finish the overhaul of its popular Macintosh operating system -- the type of program that controls the fundamental functions of a computer -- in late 1997.
But the key asset that Apple acquired is Jobs. He will serve part-time as a technology adviser and will report to Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio.
Several Apple programmers working on the Mac overhaul said they have been frustrated for months with a string of weak managers who could not get the project past a rough sketch even after three years. With Jobs, the programmers said, they hope the project can finally move forward.
""Everybody is excited,"" said an Apple employee close to the project. ""I am very excited.""
The risk of hiring Jobs is his volatility. People who have worked for him said Jobs has a knack for inspiring engineers to think that their work is a life-or-death project, a sentiment Apple now needs. But the same sentiment can burn engineers out.
""In some ways he has mellowed, but he still has an incessant drive for perfection,"" said Joanna Hoffman, the Mac's first marketing manager.
Jobs could not be reached on Saturday for comment. On Friday he told reporters he was looking forward to rejoining the company he co-founded nearly 20 years ago out of his parent's garage.
""I feel very lucky to be a part-time Apple employee and work for Gil and advise him on product strategy.""
Jobs also will work with Apple Chief Technical Officer Ellen Hancock, a veteran International Business Machines Corp. software manager who has set specific goals for the operating system team.
Jobs' visionary role and Hancock's strict, no-nonsense management style balance nicely, said Tim Bajarin, analyst at market researcher Creative Strategies Research.",0
"Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported a $120 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 1997 and warned investors it did not expect to return to profitability until September.
The troubled computer maker attributed the loss to slow sales of its its consumer-oriented Performa desktop computers during the normally robust Christmas quarter.
Apple's loss, which equalled 96 cents a share, compared with a loss of $69 million, or 56 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Sales for its first fiscal quarter ended on Dec. 27 fell to $2.13 billion from $3.15 billion.
Based on the weak first quarter results, the company said it planned to develop additional restructuring programmes during the second quarter with the goals of reducing its break-even point to $8 billion in annual revenues and enabling Apple to return to  profitability by the fourth fiscal quarter, which ends Sept. 26, 1997.
Previously, Apple had promised to return to sustainable profits by March but industry analysts had started to question that goal after Apple disclosed less than two weeks ago that sales of its Performa line were running behind plan.
""While we were very disappointed by the Performa sales results and the associated loss, our financial position remains sound,"" said Apple Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson. ""We exited the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and continued to show improvements in our inventory management during the quarter.
""Additionally we saw a 15 percent sequential increase in our high-end Power Macintosh sales,"" he said. ""We significantly exceeded our internal plans for shipments of PowerBooks and expect their availability to continue to improve in the second quarter.""
Nevertheless, analysts said the results, which Apple forecast less than two weeks ago represented a setback for Apple Chairman Gilbert Amelio, who had set a goal of stanching Apple's losses in 1996.
""Our expectations now do not show a profit until the fourth quarter, which ends in September,"" said Walter Winnitzki, analyst at brokerage PainWebber Inc. in New York.",0
"Jilted once, financial software company Intuit Inc appears unlikely to return to the merger altar any time soon.
Buyout speculation has swirled around Intuit since May 1995, when Microsoft Corp. dumped its plans to buy the maker of popular personal finance software like Quicken and TurboTax. Last week, Intuit shares surged again on speculation American Express Co. was about to make an offer.  
However, many industry analysts believe such a deal is not in Intuit's future, adding the best way for Intuit to grow is to attract as many partners as it can to set up online banking services.
""My personal belief is that Intuit is best able to maximize its value on its own,"" said David Farina, an analyst at William Blair.
Intuit's key asset is Quicken, a program that helps computer users track checkbook balances, check stock portfolios, pay bills, plan monthly budgets and lay out retirement plans.  
The company depends on partnerships with dozens of banks and brokerages to provide online links between customers' personal computers and their accounts.
Intuit would turn off most of its partners if it were acquired by a big financial partner, Scott Cook, Intuit's chairman, insists.
""We would never become a captive of one financial institution or a small group of financial institutions,"" Cook told a group of investors in Florida on Friday.  
Still, some analysts questioned whether Intuit has the marketing and financial muscle to compete on its own against Microsoft for long.
Microsoft, the world's biggest personal computer software company, is spending a big chunk of its $2 billion research and development budget on financial software and online banking services provided through the Internet.
Although Intuit still controls 70 percent of the market for personal financial software, Microsoft is gaining.  
Intuit also needs capital to expand into new area, such as giving online investment advice, said Karen Epper, an analyst at Forrester Research, a market researcher. Such forays will likely hurt profits, she said.
""They might get dinged on their stock price, but this area is more in line with the consumer marketing business model they have,"" Epper said.
It could be years, however, before Intuit's push into new areas could pay off, Epper said.
Intuit said in September it expects lower revenue growth in the current fiscal year ending July 1997.  
The company blamed a slow market for consumer software. Some of the shortfall is because of one-time suitor Microsoft, analysts said.
In October 1994, Microsoft stunned Wall Street by offering to buy Intuit for more than $1 billion, the biggest acquisition attempt in the software industry at the time.
Microsoft was willing to pay that huge sum to turn Quicken into a gateway for online banking services, an industry that's expected to rival brick-and-mortar retail banking in revenue in the next ten years.  
Microsoft backed out of the deal in May 1995, however, when the Justice Department said it would sue Microsoft on antitrust grounds if it pursued the transaction.
Since then, Microsoft has spent hundreds of millions beefing up its rival Microsoft Money financial management program. The company also set up a division to sell networking and Internet software to banks.
To counter Microsoft's redoubled efforts, Intuit set up a business to process online transactions -- such as bill payments and account transfers -- between banks and depositors. Some investors saw the unit, Intuit Services Corp., as a promising source of revenue.
In September, however, Intuit sold the unit to rival Checkfree Corp., partly because it did not have the expertise to handle huge volumes of transactions.
Banks also were reluctant to have Intuit sit between them and their depositors, Epper said. Most banks preferred to reach their customers through the Internet instead of Intuit's proprietary network.
""Intuit is staring down the barrel of a gun, and that gun is the Internet, which is making financial management easier,"" Epper said.
It could be a while before Intuit outlines a new strategy for growing its business, analysts said.
Meanwhile, there may be more bouts of wishful thinking about an acquisition, they said.",0
"Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth said on Friday U.S. cigarette makers had delayed harsh revelations about the industry with a surprising decision to end pre-trial opposition to punitive damages in the state's multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit.
Butterworth told Reuters a court hearing set for January 24 on the punitive claims to be added to any other jury awards would have made public information he alleged would have been highly damaging about the industry's marketing and medical research, contained in 27,000 pages of court-sealed documents.  
""I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty,"" Butterworth said.  ""They want to delay.  It's their best short-term ploy.""
Florida is one of 18 states suing U.S. cigarette companies to recoup billions of dollars spent through government healthcare programs on treating people made ill by smoking.  A trial in the Florida lawsuit filed by Butterworth is set for August 4.  
Philip Morris Cos Inc and other cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, earlier dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the State of Florida.  The state is seeking to recoup $1 billion or more for treating Medicaid costs from 1994.
Philip Morris Cos Inc lawyer Gregory Little said in a news release that the industry's decision had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.  
Little said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state's lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during a public, pre-trial hearing.  Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.
""The lawyers for the state of Florida have demonstrated a remarkable propensity for trying their case in the media,"" Little said.
He accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters.  
""... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs' lawyers to once again trumpet their case making it difficult for all parties to seat an unbiased jury,"" Little said.
Other tobacco companies, including RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp, have accused anti-tobacco lawyers of selective and unfair leaks to the media.  
Butterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in the documents but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in their anti-tobacco lawsuits.
""It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science ... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,"" Butterworth said.
""This is a 100 percent victory for the state,"" he said of the industry's decision.
""The only downside is that disclosure of the documents is delayed.""
A trial in the lawsuit is scheduled to begin on August 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida.",0
"New Corp. Ltd. said Tuesday that its Fox News division will file suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court here against Time Warner Inc., Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and its Chairman Ted Turner, alleging antitrust violations.
News Corp., which is led by media mogul Rupert Murdoch, said the suit will allege that an antitrust conspiracy to block Fox News Channel in New York City has taken place prior to the still-to-be consummated merger.
""The suit will allege that the conspiracy has taken place prior to the still-to-be-consummated merger,"" Arthur Siskind, News Corp. Group General Counsel, said in a brief statement. ""The suit also charges Time Warner with breach of contract and fraud in reneging on its agreement to carry Fox News in New York City.""
Locked in a bitter campaign to win New York channel space for its Fox News service, News Corp. on Monday urged city officials to void cable-TV franchises with Time Warner Inc.
News Corp. executives told city officials at a hearing that the pending merger of Time Warner and Turner constituted a change of control of Time Warner's cable systems in New York City and allowed early rebidding for the valuable franchises.
Time Warner holds city cable-television franchises serving 1.2 millions New Yorkers that are due to expire in 1998.
Time Warner, which denies the merger constitutes a change in management control, has refused to carry the 24-hour Fox News service and instead carries two Cable News Network services owned by Turner, and MSNBC, a joint venture of General Electric Co.'s NBC and Microsoft Corp.
Turner and Time Warner are expected to merge on Thursday, creating the world's biggest media organisation. Turner Chairman Ted Turner will become vice chairman of the new company and will be the company's biggest shareholder.
Time Warner is also opposing a proposal backed by New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani that Fox News be carried on a city-owned channel known as CrossWalks.
Giulani has said that wide dissemination of Fox News throughout New York was important since it was the only all-news channel based within the city and was the source of hundreds of jobs.
The city's Franchise Concession and Review Committee is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether or not the Turner-Time Warner deal should prompt a review of the Time Warner franchises.
Time Warner executive Richard Aurelio said Monday that 90 percent of the regulators overseeing Time Warner's cable operations, the second largest in the United States, had passed without objection on the Turner-Time Warner merger.",0
"Silver King Communications Inc. agreed Monday to buy the Home Shopping Network (HSN) for about $1.3 billion in stock, feeding speculation that Barry Diller was getting set to launch another major television network.
Diller, who is chairman of both Silver King and Home Shopping, could be positioning his companies to compete head on with ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, whose launch Diller spearheaded in the 1980s, industry analysts said.
The deal would reunite Silver King, which owns 12 TV stations spun off in 1992 by HSN, with its old parent.
Diller, widely known in Hollywood for leading the launch of Fox, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., had already announced plans to drop HSN programming from Silver King's stations and replace it with a traditional mix of locally oriented news, sports and other shows.
""We have a long agenda,"" Diller said in an interview. ""By putting these companies under a common roof, we will get there quicker.""
Diller said speculation that he would start a new national network was premature but he said cash generated by HSN would help Silver King pay for programming and other costs in developing its stations.
Diller declined to discuss details of Silver King's programming, saying plans will be unveiled in November or December. A Silver King spokesman said the programming would emphasise local news and sports and would appear in some markets starting in about a year.
Some executives have said Silver King, with stations in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and other leading markets, would initially target late-night and daytime slots with its own programmes. Start-up networks usually start building their programming with evening fare.
HSN, which pays fees to Silver King to broadcast its retailing shows, will seek to win more slots on cable systems as Silver King's stations convert to traditional television programming, an HSN spokesman said.
Silver King said the stock-swap merger was worth about $1.27 billion based on Friday's closing stock prices. The deal calls for each HSN shareholder to receive 0.45 of a share of Silver King common for each share of HSN stock owned.
""I think it's a very viable deal,"" said analyst Alvin Mirman of Commonwealth Associates. ""Diller reduces Home Shopping's distribution costs immediately. That could be a much as $40 million a year.""
Mirman said he expects Diller to establish another network once he has overhauled the Silver King stations, which together comprise the sixth largest TV company in the United States.
Diller is also buying Savoy Pictures, a money-losing studio that owns other television stations, for about $117 million in stock.
Although HSN, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., invented television shopping in the early 1980s and was once a favourite on Wall Street, it has fallen to number two behind QVC Inc. as its sales have stagnated at about $1 billion annually.
Still, its 24-hour programming reaches some 69 million households via cable television, broadcast station affiliates and satellite dish receivers.
Diller, a highly successful television programmer credited with the Fox network's racy and successful shows, is also expected to revive Home Shopping Network's fortunes, analysts said.
Under the terms of the deal, each share of HSN Class B stock, which has 10 votes per share and is held solely by Liberty Media Corp., will be converted into 0.54 of a share of Silver King Class B Stock.
Silver King said Liberty Media, in order to stay within rules on television-station ownership, will retain a 19.9 percent stake in HSN, under the 21 percent allowed by regulators. Liberty Media already owns a stake in Silver King.
Home Shopping Network stock rose 12.5 cents to $11.375 on the New York Stock Exchange and Silver King fell $1.50 to $28 on Nasdaq.",0
"Riding rising U.S. cable TV fees, Time Warner Inc said its earnings before heavy debt payments shot up 32 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same three months last year.
Covering the quarter before last Thursday's completion of its $7.5 billion acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System, the entertainment group said three hit movies, strong magazine advertising sales helped by the Olympic Games, and good HBO results lifted cash flow to $964 million.
Revenues for the three months ended Sept. 30 were $4.877 billion, up from $4.344 billion a year ago.
Last year's third-quarter cash flow, defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $729 million, the company said on Wednesday.
Time Warner, many of whose cable TV and other businesses are co-owned with 25 percent partner U S West Inc. , reported a net loss of $167 million, or 43 cents a share, for the quarter.
Net losses in last year's quarter were $160 million, or 41 cents a share, on 1.5 million more shares outstanding.
Net interest costs were $276 million, up from $259 million in last year's third quarter. Preferred dividends rose to $76 million in the third quarter from $16 million.
Time Warner's stock showed no gain after the results but rose smartly later in the day after top executives told institutional investors that debt reduction was centre stage at the company.
The executives said Time Warner is in active discussions aimed at restructuring its troubled cable-television partnership with U S West Media Group.
One Time Warner executive said the talks with regional phone group U S West, 25 percent owner of most of Time Warner's cable systems, studios and the HBO pay-TV service, are likely to quicken and could yield a deal within months.
""We want to delever the company, lighten up on cable, and simplify the corporate capital structure,"" said the executive, speaking on a promise of anonymity.
The executives echoed Ted Turner, founder of Turner Broadcasting and now vice chairman of the combined company as well as its biggest individual shareholder. He has said he wants Time Warner's $17.5 billion debt halved.
Time Warner now sees itself with the acquisition of Turner, producer of Cable News Network, The Cartoon Network and two studios, as primarily a programming group, the executives said.
Capital-intensive cable operations are less important and ripe for partial divestment, the executives said. Investment capital can be better used outside cable, the executives said.
EBITDA at Time Warner's cable operations, including those shared with with U S West, rose 14 percent to $512 million, the company said in its earnings report.
Basic cable revenues rose sharply and advertising sales in cable also increased, the company said. With some 12.1 million customers, Time Warner is the nation's second-largest cable operator.
Time Warner also had three summer movies grossing more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales -- ""Twister,"" ""Eraser"" and ""A Time To Kill"".
Time Warner shares rose $1.125 to $42 in New York Stock Exchange Trading.",0
"The Florida judge in a class-action suit against tobacco groups Thursday allowed one of the pioneering case's lead smokers to take a back seat in the upcoming trial after he complained of intimidation.
Stanley Rosenblatt, the lawyer pursuing the class-action suit on behalf of all ill and addicted smokers in Florida, said in Dade County Court that Arthur Reeves had been one of the original six smokers in the suit filed three years ago but did not want to take a prominent role as a witness in a trial scheduled for Sept. 8.
""He feels he has been greatly embarrassed and humiliated by investigators going out and asking neighbors and relatives and people he hasn't seen in 30 years about him,"" Rosenblatt said.
The lawyer gave no details in court, but said at a news conference Wednesday that private investigators working for tobacco companies routinely checked the backgrounds of people opposing them in court and potential trial jurors.
Rosenblatt asked Dade County Circuit Court Judge Alan Postman to allow another smoker, throat-cancer victim Frank Amodeo of Orlando, Fla., to be substituted for Reeves.
Amodeo said Wednesday he began smoking at 14, more than a decade before the health dangers of smoking were known, and that he has tried to stop smoking repeatedly. He still smokes and takes liquid nourishment through a feeding tube, since he can neither eat nor drink.
Rosenblatt said Reeves was not withdrawing from the suit, an option any ill smoker in Florida can choose, but would not act as a representive of the 500,000 potential claimants Rosenblatt has estimated his suit covers.
Reeves would share in money awards, if any, secured through the trial. The case appears likely to be the first to come to trial of a dozen or more class-action suits filed by smokers against tobacco companies.
Rosenblatt claims that tobacco companies such as Liggett Group, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Loews Corp. and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries conspired for decades to hide medical evidence damaging to their businesses and mislead Americans about the dangers of smoking.
A lawyer for Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said that allowing the switch just months before trial was unfair.
The lawyer, Philip Heim, said he had no knowledge of Reeves' complaints. ""I don't know anything about him being allegedly harassed,"" Heim said.",0
"International businessman Tony O'Reilly said on Friday acquisitions by his Independent Newspapers Plc will slow considerably next year after the takeover of New Zealand's leading newspaper and other deals.
""I consider next year a year of consolidation,"" Independent Newspapers Chairman O'Reilly told Reuters in a telephone interview.  
But O'Reilly's name came up just this week in London markets as the rumored buyer of Mirror Group Newspapers Plc's 46 percent stake in Britain's Independent Newspapers Plc.
Both Mirror Group and O'Reilly, whose separate, Dublin-based firm also owns a 46 percent stake in the British title, denied a deal was in the works.
O'Reilly, best known in the United States as chairman of H.J. Heinz Co, also acknowledged his company was keeping a close eye on Australian media group John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.  
Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon who runs Hollinger International Inc, sold a 20 percent stake in Fairfax this week after complaining about Australian limits on foreign ownership of newspaper companies.
Some press reports suggest Fairfax might sell a top newspaper or become an acquisition target.
""The situation there is fluid, very interesting,"" O'Reilly said. ""You can just say the O'Reillys are looking on with interest.""  
News Corp Ltd chairman Rupert Murdoch last month sold his five percent stake in Fairfax and on Wednesday said he had lost interest in the company because of the foreign ownership ceilings. A native Australian, Murdoch is now a U.S. citizen.
Independent Newspapers owns a 25 percent stake in the Australian regional newspaper company APN, and this year acquired a controlling 85 percent stake in Wilson & Horton in a deal valuing the leading New Zealand newspaper company at NZ$1.32 billion.  
""Wilson & Horton will be an important springboard for us,"" O'Reilly said.
The executive said the New Zealand company would help Independent expand its commercial printing and educational businesses in the region.
O'Reilly said his executives next year would be working primarily on increasing results and efficiencies in Independent properties. Deals, in part because his family wishes to maintain its 28 percent equity stake in Independent, would be secondary.
Company results should be strong in 1997, he said.  
The company's South African properties will have to produce better than normal profit gains to offset currency losses expected from a drop in the South African rand, he said.
Independent's newspapers in Ireland, Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and elsewhere will benefit from a sharp drop in newsprint. Costs for the raw material of newspapers has dropped from an average $520 a ton within the past year to around $400 currently, he said.  
O'Reilly described as reasonable profit forecasts by Dublin's Davey Stockbrokers that Independent would post a 15 percent profit rise to 18.6 pence per share in 1997 and an 18 percent rise to 21.4 pence per share in 1998.",0
"Quick & Reilly Group Inc agreed on Wednesday to buy over-the-counter market-maker  Nash, Weiss Inc, another step by the pioneering discount broker into low-profile, but lucrative financial services businesses.
Terms were not disclosed, but two sons of co-founder Leslie Quick Jr said in an interview that the acquisition of the New Jersey firm was by far the biggest deal Quick & Reilly has done.
Nash, Weiss buys and sells on behalf of retail brokerages some 2,500 stocks listed on the Nasda.  
Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Sears said the acquisition may be the start of a flurry of deals involving market-makers in Nasdaq stocks as reforms in pricing threaten to narrow the often wide spreads on Nasdaq stocks.
Investors have complained that the price differences can amount to as much as 10 percent or more of a stock price.
""Going for market share through acquisitions is one way to make up for narrowing spreads,"" Sears said.
He said he knew of no pending deals.  
Among the top six independent Nasdaq market makers, Nash, Weiss profits on the spread, or difference between prices the seller and buyer get. It employs about 60 people, Quick & Reilly said.
The biggest Nasdaq market makers are subsidaries of big financial firms.
""This gives us another major leg,"" said Leslie Quick III, head of the company's U.S. Clearing Corp subsidiary. ""We expect this Nasdaq market maker business to be a fourth leg for us.""  
Best known as a retail broker, Quick & Reilly is also a significant force through U.S. Clearing in backroom processing of Wall Street trading and owner of the JCC Specialist Corp., the second-largest market-maker, or specialist firm, on the New York Stock Exchange.
""The deal really plays well with The Quick & Reilly Group as whole,"" said Salomon Brothers analyst Michael Sears. ""With U.S. Clearing it gives Nash, Weiss a lot of potential for going after instutitional clients.""  
Thomas Quick, president of the firm, said Quick & Reilly with Nash, Weiss would court institutional clients by adding to its roster of 2,500 securities in which it makes markets.
""That number will probably go to 3,500 to 4,000,"" Leslie Quick III said.
The brothers, whose father, chairman Leslie Quick Jr., co-founded the firm in the early 1970s, said the mightily improved  capitalization of Nash, Weiss after the merger with Quick & Reilly will make it much more attractive to large institutional clients.  
Thomas Quick said the leading market-maker for institutional clients had capitalization of about $80 million, or 20 times or more that of Nash, Weiss. Sears said Quick & Reilly had capitalization of about $350 million.
The brothers said they expect revenues at Nash, Weiss to rise dramatically as long as stock trading remains robust and may even double to $120 million by early 1998.
Business has been strong in December and in January and should yield a strong fiscal fourth-quarter, Thomas Quick said. He declined to comment on analysts forecasts of earnings. Sears expects Quick & Reilly to report $0.77 a share for the period ending February 28. Last year, the company reported a normalized $0.91.
Co-founder Leslie Quick Jr serves as chairman and chief executive of the firm, which was the first to offer discounted commissions on New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks after fixed trading commissions were abolished in 1975.",0
"With the dark cloud of high raw material costs now clearing, large U.S. newspapers companies are expected to report good third-quarter earnings despite weak growth in advertising.
""I keep hearing good news out of these guys, and they're all smiling about newsprint,"" said Prudential Securities newspaper industry analyst James Marsh.
Newsprint for newspapers now costs an average $550 a ton, much less than the average forecast of $600 a ton at the start of 1996, he said. Per ton prices peaked at $743 last January.  
""Trends in advertising have been a little sluggish, but with lower newsprint costs, most newspapers should have a strong quarter,"" said newspaper industry analyst Edward Atorino at Oppenheimer & Co.
Retail advertising were tepid through late summer, after rising only about one percent during the first half of the year, compared with the first six months of 1995, analysts said.
Classified advertising rose 10 percent in the first half but likely cooled in the third quarter, Atorino said.  
Times Mirror Co will enjoy an especially strong lift from newsprint savings because of its inventory accounting methods and a sharp decline in its consumption of newsprint this year after shutting two big city papers, Marsh said.
""The fall in newsprint prices coupled with ongoing cost reduction efforts will result in strong second-half earnings for newspaper publishing companies this year and provide further benefit into 1997,"" Atorino said in a written report.",0
"Silver King Communications Inc chairman Barry Diller said on Monday that the $1.27 billion stock-swap acqusition of Home Shopping Network would help fund Silver King's ambitious broadcasting plans.
""We have a long agenda and this helps certainly in developing the stations. We will get there quicker by combining the two companies,"" Diller told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Silver King agreed earlier to acquire HSN, a limping number two in U.S. TV retailing, for $1.27 billion in stock.  
The deal reunites Silver King, owner of 12 U.S. television stations spun off in 1992 by HSN, with its old parent and feeds speculation that Diller is close to launching a seventh U.S. television network.
Diller described as premature the speculation he would start a new national network, but said the cash flow from HSN would help Silver King pay for programming and other costs in developing its stations.  
Diller, a celebrated Hollywood executive credited with leading the 1980s launch of the FOX network, had already announced plans to drop HSN programming now carried on Silver King's stations in order to replace it with a traditional mix of locally oriented news, sports and other shows.
The stations in major markets such as Miami, New York and Los Angeles could attract significant audiences eagerly sought by advertisers, become much more valuable and form the nucleus of a national television network, industry analysts said.
""Silver King will use Home Shopping's cash flow. That will be the start of the benefits,"" Diller said.
""For Home Shopping, it adds businesses it is not now in,"" he said, adding the combined companies would be financially vigorous and poised to exploit new forms of electronic retailing.
""I am thrilled with the combination,"" Diller said.
""As to its more expansive possibilities, I believe the combination will allow the companies the very best way to pursue their very aggressive individual agendas with clarity and without conflict.""",0
"Quick & Reilly Group Inc sees revenues possibly doubling to as much as $120 million by early 1998 at the OTC market-maker, Nash, Weiss & Co, the pioneering discount broker is buying, top Quick executives said on Wednesday.
The firm also plans to move Nash, Weiss, now largely a market maker for retail brokerages, into the institutional side of the business by adding 1,000 or more issues to its current 2,500 roster, Quick President Thomas Quick told Reuters.  
""This gives us another major leg,"" said Leslie Quick III, the president's brother and head of the discount-brokerage's U.S. Clearing Corp subsidiary. ""We expect this Nasdaq market maker business to be a fourth leg for us.""

""That number will probably go to 3,500 to 4,000,"" Leslie Quick III said.
The brothers, whose father, chairman Leslie Quick Jr, co-founded the firm in the early 1970s, said the mightily improved  capitalization of Nash, Weiss after the merger with Quick & Reilly will make it much more attractive to large institutional clients.
""Right now, they are on the retail side,"" said Leslie Quick III. ""They are probably the fifth or sixth largest. We think we can take the business into the top three. With our balance sheet, we can go after institutions.""  
Thomas Quick said the leading market-maker for institutional clients had capitalization of about $80 million, or 20 times or more that of Nash Weiss.
The brothers said they expect revenues at Nash, Weiss, to rise dramatically as long as stock trading remains robust and may even double by the end of fiscal year 1998. The company's fiscal year ends on the last day of February.
Nash, Weiss will be run as a separate subsidiary remaining in Jersey City, New Jersey, and no job cuts or restructurings were planned, the brothers said.

"Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday it will launch its CNN/SI sports news service on Dec. 12, more than a month after the debut of another sports news television channel from rival media conglomerate Walt Disney Co.
Time Warner executives meeting reporters said CNN/SI would combine the television apparatus of the Cable News Network and the sports expertise of Sports Illustrated, a weekly sports magazine published by Time Warner since 1954.
In a bid to reach wider audiences when various all-news services are scrambling to secure channel slots on America's crowded cable-television systems, the executives said CNN would simultaneously carry a nightly sports news programme being delivered to CNN/SI subscribers. CNN reaches some 70 million U.S. homes.
General Motors Corp., LCI International and Delta Airlines were among 13 advertisers that have signed on with CNN/SI, the executives said.
ESPNEWS, majority owned by Disney, began service on Nov. 1.
Both services compete against NewSport, a 24-hour sports news service owned by General Electric Co. unit NBC, Rainbow Programming, and a subsidiary of Tele-Communications Inc.
NBC, in alliance with Microsoft Corp., last summer launched the all-news service MSNBC to compete against CNN, part of Time Warner since the October takeover of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. News Corp. also recently launched a general news TV service and is fighting in court to secure a channel slot on Time Warner's New York cable systems delivering television to 1.1 million homes and Madison Avenue.

"Grand Metropolitan Plc's Burger King is benefitting from a sales recovery in Europe, as well as strong U.S. expansion, and should post $10 billion in sales in the fiscal year ending September 30, Burger King chief executive Robert Lowes said on Tuesday.
""There's no question that my goal for this year is $10 billion, to add a billion in sales,"" Lowes told Reuters.  
Burger King's worldwide sales through some 8,700 restaurants, including 756 added during the fiscal year, totalled $9 billion in fiscal 1996, or nine percent more than in the previous 12 months.
Burger King also said in a brief year-end summary that its market share rose, touching 16.2 percent of all fast-food hamburger restaurant sales.  The company competes against sector-leading McDonald's Corp and Wendy's International Inc.  
Comparable store sales, meaning those restaurants open at lease one year, rose 2.3 percent worldwide and 2.6 percent in the United States, Lowes said.
Grand Met, the British branded-goods conglomerate, said last week operating profits at Burger King declined in the last fiscal year because of a European beef scare and a planned turndown in sales of restaurants to franchisees.
European sales last spring were hit by an outbreak of a disease attributed to contaminated British beef, especially hurting the company's hamburger outlets in Britain, France and Germany.  
Lowes said Burger King had responded by substituting for beef some chicken and other foods, including a vegetarian hamburger in Britain, to sustain sales in Europe.
""Our sales volumes are back where they were,"" Lowes said, referring to existing stores.
The executive said new stores to be added, including 75 to be built along British motorways in a deal with Granada Group Plc, would lift sales.
Burger King was also negotiating other deals in Europe similar to the one with Granada, Lowes said.  He gave no details.",0

The publishing unit's EBITDA was $99 million, or 15 percent more than the $86 million posted in the year-ago quarter. Sports Illustrated, which produced a daily, limited-circulation version of its weekly magazine during the Atlanta Olympics, had particularly strong advertising sales.
The recorded music unit's EBITDA rose $1 million to $143 million from last year's quarter, when the division took an $85 million charge. Small gains in foreign sales were offset by drops in U.S. music sales, the company said.

Time Warner earlier reported very strong operational earnings from its cable operations, largely on rate increases, but the company has also committed to spending at least $4 billion to improve its systems through 2000.
The executives declined to discuss possible terms of a U S West agreement but analysts have speculated Time Warner might swap selected cable properties for U S West's equity in HBO and the studios. A key question in such a deal would be how much debt would be taken off Time Warner's books.  
Spin-off of properties is also possible, analysts have said. Time Warner is also said to be considering the sale of Castle Rock, one of the studios owned by Turner Broadcasting.
The executives said a deal with U S West was very important but failure to reach one would not stop the debt-reduction campaign.
A little-noticed deal earlier this year, in which Time Warner swapped some cable properties for a minority interest in a joint venture with Fanch Cablevision of Indiana and the Blackstone Group, could be a model for other cable transactions, the executives said.
""The objective of deleveraging is larger than U S West. The objective of lightening up on cable is larger than U S West,"" one of the Time Warner executives said.

"Cigarette companies, complaining of likely bad publicity, Friday dropped pre-trial opposition to punitive claims by the state of Florida in a multi-billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuit.
Florida is seeking $1 billion or more from U.S. cigarette makers for actual costs incurred in its Medicaid healthcare programme for treating people afflicted with smoking-related ailments. Punitive damages, assuming a victory for the state, raise the potential losses to the industry substantially.
The state last month won the right to claim even further damages under Florida's anti-racketeering laws, a legal precedent in the spreading courtroom battle against tobacco companies. State lawyers have said the racketeering claims could cost cigarette makers tens of billions of dollars.
A lawyer for Philip Morris Cos Inc., one of the defending tobacco companies, said in a news release that ending pre-trial opposition had no legal effect and that the industry had never paid punitive damages in any lawsuit.
Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth hailed the action as victory and said the industry had made a major legal concession to delay harsh disclosures during a scheduled Jan. 24 hearing about industry marketing and medical research practices.
""I liken it to a criminal trial in which the defendant tries to suppress evidence that would prove him guilty,"" Butterworth said in an interview. ""They want to delay. It's their best short-term ploy.""
Butterworth said he was forbidden by court order from detailing the damaging information in 27,000 pages of documents to have been presented on Jan. 24 but said 90 percent of the material came from industry internal documents. Much of the material was gathered by other attorneys general, many of whom are cooperating in anti-tobacco lawsuits filed by 18 states.
""It's nearly all their documents, all about their marketing practices, their science ... and they are giving up everything to avoid publicity,"" Butterworth said.
Philip Morris lawyer Gregory Little said a key reason for the industry's decision was a worry that the state lawyers would present evidence against cigarette makers during the hearing open to journalists. Tobacco lawyers would be severly restricted in defending against the evidence during the hearing, he said.
""... The January 24 hearing -- which was already window dressed for media consumption with a 442-page brief and 12 boxes of documents -- would have done nothing other than provide a platform for the plaintiffs lawyers to once again trumpet their case ...,"" Little said.
He accused anti-tobacco lawyers in Florida of leaking documents to reporters and polluting the pool of unbiased potential jurors needed for a fair trial.
The judge in the Florida trial, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 4 in West Palm Beach, Florida, last fall threw out 15 of the state government's original 18 claims.
Defendants in the case, one of several such lawsuits brought by state governments scheduled to go to trial this year, include RJR Nabisco Holdings and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain.
The industry may receive another legal blow if a reported campaign by Brooke Group, parent of cigarette maker Ligget Group Inc., to settle Medicaid claims in a deal that could involve the exchange of confidential documents.
Liggett was last year the first tobacco company to ever settle cigarette lawsuits in an accord with five states which had sued the industry to recoup health-care costs of smokers.",0
"Eastman Kodak Co secured only a partial exit from the bruising copier wars with the $684 million sale on Monday of its copier-marketing and service operations to Britain's Danka Business Systems Plc.
Prompted by chronic financial weakness, highlighted by the fact Kodak's copier sales of $1.8 billion yield only $20 million in annual operating profits, the sale prompted segment leader Xerox Corp to throw down the gauntlet to Danka.
""They're on our turf now and are going to have to chase us to win business,"" said Xerox executive Gill Hatch.  
Hatch predicted the Danka-Kodak deal will bring pricing pressures to the copier business. ""Suffice to say that Danka has been aggressive, and will continue to be aggressive,"" Hatch said.
According to Danka chief executive Dan Doyle, the acquisition and a 10-year alliance with Kodak will give high-flying Danka a full line of copiers to offer low, middle and upmarket customers around the world.
Kodak is retaining its manufacturing and development operations in copiers, as well as some key technology.  
The remaining Kodak businesses will have about $600 million a year in sales, or a third of its former turnover. Danka will be its main customer as the primary distributor of Kodak copiers and printers.
""Danka's growth will be our growth,"" said Kodak co-chief operating officer Carl Kohrt.
Kohrt predicted Kodak's rump copier businesses would be profitable by the end of 1997 and that the transaction, netting Kodak about $600 million in cash, would be immediately accretive to earnings. The deal should close by December 31.  
Analyst Gary Schneider of Bear Stearns said he had hoped Kodak would have quit copiers entirely and will have to prove to Wall Street it can turn around the financial performance of the remaining copier businesses.
""The question is what kind of normalized earnings can you get out of those,"" he said.
Monday's deal is just the latest bit of corporate trimming at Kodak, which has spun off and sold businesses, generating some $8 billion. The company has in the 1990s exited pharmaceuticals, household goods and chemicals.  
The company said last winter it wanted to exit or reposition its copier businesses because its financial performance was subpar and promised little hope for a turnaround as it stood.
Kohrt said the deal with Danka will stimulate sales of Kodak copiers. ""What we've really needed is pull-through from the market,"" he said.
Danka chief executive Dan Doyle said Kodak's strong focus on big customers needing high-volume copiers and services dovetailed with Danka's traditional presence among low and middle-market customers.
News of the deal boosted Danka's American Depositary Receipts, which closed up 6-5/8 at 36-1/2. Kodak closed down 1/2 at 71-3/4.",0
"Silver King Communication's $1.27 billion stock-swap acquistion of Home Shopping Network hastens Silver King's plans to become a conventional broadcast-TV powerhouse, Silver King said on Monday.
The deal re-uniting Silver King, spun off by Home Shopping five years ago, with its former parent also feeds speculation that Silver King chairman Barry Diller is closer to launching a seventh U.S. television network.
Veteran entertainment-industry executive Diller led the 1980s launch of News Corp Ltd's Fox network.  
Silver King spokesman Jason Stewart said Diller had no firm plans to launch a network and intended for now to reprogram Silver King's 12 stations carrying Home Shopping Network with conventional, locally oriented shows.
""With most stations emphasizing national and syndicated programs, there's room for local,"" Stewart said.
Stewart said some Silver King stations, located in top markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Miami, would be converted in about a year and others would follow.  
He declined to detail Diller's programming plans but said the stations would cover local news and sports with a format common on all Silver King stations. Some entertainment executives have speculated the Silver King stations would program daytime and late-night slots initially.
Silver King, which is paid by Home Shopping Network to broadcast its television retailing service, intends to seek cable-system carriage of Home Shopping as its stations convert to traditional television programming.
A Home Shopping spokesman declined to say whether or not the company had reached carriage deals with any cable systems.  
Diller said last spring that Silver King, which is partly owned by Tele-Communications Inc subsidiary Liberty Media, as is Home Shopping Network, intended to break away from Home Shopping but that the conversion would take two or three years.
Diller also has a stake in SF Broadcasting, owner of four stations, that could be woven into a new U.S. network.
""I think it's a very viable deal,"" said analyst Alvin Mirman of Commonwealth Associates. ""Diller reduces Home Shopping's distribution costs immediately. That could be a much as $40 million a year.""
Diller, a highly successful television programmer credited with the FOX network's racy and successful shows, is also expected to revive Home Shopping Network's fortunes. Home Shopping's sales have been flat for several years.
Home Shopping Network's shares were up 1/4 to 11-1/2, while Silver King's shares were down 1-7/8 to 27-5/8.",0
"Florida is set to challenge the tobacco industry on Friday using a tough anti-racketeering law that could mean bigger damages against cigarette makers if the state prevails.
The new claim under the state's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act, tacked onto Florida's existing lawsuit that seeks at least $1 billion for treating smokers' illnesses, could mean more losses for the tobacco makers, tobacco-litigation expert Christopher Mueller of the University of Colorado School of Law said.
""Florida has a good law (for winning damage claims) but it only goes back to 1994. Using RICO may give the state a deeper reach,"" Mueller said.
The state's RICO law, similar to a federal statute and laws on the books in other states, would allow Florida officials to seek damages from before 1994, when a state law was passed that opened the way for Florida to try to recoup money spent on treating poor smokers.
Florida is one of 16 states and several big cities, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, that have sued tobacco companies to recoup costs of health care for poor smokers.
Texas and now Florida are among a handful of states that are also using RICO laws to bolster their claims against Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the world's biggest cigarette maker, and other tobacco companies. Florida filed the added claims under RICO laws on Nov 4.
Mueller said use of RICO could add to the industry's potential financial losses by allowing Florida to make claims to recoup costs of treating smokers from before 1994.
Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth is set to appear on Friday in county court in West Palm Beach, a spokesman said. He and attorneys for tobacco companies will argue over the industry's request that the RICO claim be dismissed.
It was unclear when a ruling would be made, a court official said.
Presiding Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Harold Cohen recently dismissed 15 counts of the state's 18-count lawsuit that claims the industry was liable for state-paid hospital costs from lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases. The full case is expected to come to trial next year.
A Jacksonville, Fla., jury last summer handed the tobacco industry its biggest loss in a court case yet when it awarded $750,000 to a lung cancer sufferer who had smoked for half a century. The defendant was the Brown & Williamson unit of Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc.
In Washington, anti-smoking groups said divesting tobacco investments was being actively considered by a growing number of institutional investors concerned by both the ethics and the financial outlook for the industry.",0
"Tobacco companies are countersuing Florida, saying the state government should be held liable for manufacturing cigarettes in its prisons if the state wins a billion-dollar lawsuit against cigarette makers.
Tobacco industry lawyers filed the suit on Wednesday, a Philip Morris Cos spokeswoman said and comes a week after a Florida judge blocked the industry from using Florida's history of cigarette-making in a trial scheduled to begin in August.  
Tobacco legal papers filed in Palm Beach County Court said the Florida Department of Corrections for decades made high-nicotine, high-tar cigarettes and other tobacco products and sold or distributed them to inmates.
State officials believed the cigarettes were ""particularly unhealthful ""but still distributed them to inmates.""
""The state believed that its cigarettes were cancer-causing and addictive,"" the court papers said.
The tobacco countersuit asked that Florida pay some damages along with the tobacco industry if it should win its lawsuit to be tried in August.  
Florida, the countersuit said, should be liable ""for the portion of damages that is attributable to its own conduct, or for its presumptive share of the market.""
State officials have said the tobacco used in the cigarettes was bought from one of the defendants, American Tobacco Co, and it no longer makes cigarettes in its prisons.
Spearheaded by Gov. Lawton Chiles, Florida is suing cigarette makers for $1 billion, or more in costs incurred from treating smokers through the state's Medicaid healthcare program.  
The state has also won the right to press for punitive damages under a state racketeering law if it can prove tobacco companies such as RJR Nabisco and the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries of Britain conspired to hide the health risks of tobacco from customers.
The governor is also pressing to raise cigarette taxes and backed restrictions made public this week on tobacco-related advertising on Florida's state roads.
Some two dozen state governments and other local governments are suing tobacco companies to recover monies spent on treating tobacco-related illnesses.
""It's ironic,"" said April Herrle, spokeswoman for the governor. ""This is a backdoor admission by the industry that nicotine is addictive, something it denies.""
She said the state expects the countersuit to be dismissed.
Last week, the tobacco companies were rebuffed by the trial judge in the case when they sought to use the state's cigarette-making record as a partial defense in the approaching trial.",0
"Lawyers battling cigarette companies on behalf of flight attendants exposed for decades to second-hand smoke on Wednesday began notifying potential claimants of a historic tobacco trial set to begin in June.
A mass mailing to some 120,000 former and current flight attendants on U.S. airlines seeks to identify non-smokers who suffer ailments such as lung cancer.  
Print advertisements in union and trade magazines, an Internet site and follow-up mailings seeking claimaints are to follow during the next two months.
The class-action suit claims that the illnesses were caused by second-hand smoke from cigarettes aboard airliners and seeks unspecificed damages likely to total billions of dollars.
It accuses Philip Morris Cos Inc and other leading tobacco companies of hiding the dangers of second-hand, or environmental, smoke from Americans.  
""This is clearly a milestone,"" said Richard Daynard, chairman of the Tobacco Liability Law Project at Northeastern University in Boston. ""This is the first time a class-action case has gotten to notificiation,"" he said, referring to actions taken in the tobacco industry.
A separate suit in Louisiana seeking to represent as many as 50 million ill smokers was thrown out last year. Daynard said two other class-action suits, another in Miami and the second in Pennsylvania, were also scheduled to go to trial this year.
""This is a significant stage,"" said University of Colorado School of Law professor Christopher Mueller.  
Flight attendants lawyer Stanley Rosenblatt of Miami said 25,000 to 60,000 flight attendants would likely be included in the suit out of an estimated 300,000 who worked for U.S. airlines before in-flight smoking was banned.
The suit alleges that second-hand smoke causes cardiac conditions, cancer and 21 other ailments. Rosenblatt and Daynard said scientific findings had established links between those ailments and second-hand smoke that were strong enough to stand up in a jury trial.  
""That's a very big if,"" said Michael York, an attorney for the tobacco industry. ""If he were successful in that, he has to come back and prove that second-hand smoke caused individual injuries.""
Rosenblatt said damages, if any, would be set in follow-up trials after the completion of the June 2 trial, which he estimated would run two to three months in Dade County Court. Categories of claims, such as those of people suffering with emphysma, would likely be determined separately, he said.  
Tobacco attorneys had in recent months pressed Rosenblatt to spend heavily on a national media campaign, using television and popular magazines, but Dade County Circuit Judge Robert Kaye ruled that mail notification was sufficient.
Daynard and Mueller said the tobacco industry, in expectations it would beat Rosenblatt, wanted as many potential claimaints involved in the class-action suit since those people then would not be able to sue independently.
""We think the entire case is meritless,"" York said.
Rosenblatt said any claimants who did not write and ask to be excluded from the class-action lawsuit would be included. Typically, no more than five to 10 percent of class-action claimants drop out, legal experts said.",0
"Anglo-French Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel on Monday announced a deal giving creditor banks 45.5 percent of the company in return for wiping out one billion pounds ($1.56 billion) of its debt mountain.
The long-awaited restructuring brings to an end months of wrangling between Eurotunnel and the 225 banks to which it owes nearly nine billion pounds.
The deal, announced simultaneously in Paris and London, brings the company back from the brink of insolvency but leaves shareholders owning only 54.5 percent of the company.
""The restructuring plan provides Eurotunnel with the medium term financial stability to allow it to consolidate its substantial commercial achievements to date and to develop its operations,"" Eurotunnel co-chairman Alastair Morton said.
The firm was now making a profit before interest, he added.
Although shareholders will see their interests diluted, they were offered the prospect of a brighter future after months of uncertainty while Eurotunnel wrestled to reduce crippling interest payments negotiated during the tunnel's construction.
Eurotunnel, which has taken around half the cross-Channel market from the European ferry companies, said a strong operating performance could allow it to pay its first dividend within the next 10 years.
French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said shareholders would have to be patient before they could reap the benefits of the company's success.
He called the debt restructuring plan ""an acceptable compromise"" for holders of Eurotunnel shares.
The company said in a statement there was still considerable work to be done to finalise and agree the details of the plan before it can be submitted to shareholders and the full 225 bank syndicate for approval, probably early in 1997.
Monday's announcement followed two weeks of highly secretive negotiations between Eurotunnel and its six leading banks. This was extended to the 24 ""instructing banks"" at a meeting late last week in London.
Eurotunnel said the debt-for-equity swap would be at 130 pence, or 10.40 francs, per share. That is considerably below the level of around 160 pence widely reported in the run up to the deal, and will reduce outstanding debt of 8.7 billion pounds by 1.0 billion.
The company said a further 3.7 billion pounds of debt would be converted into new financial instruments and existing shareholders would be able to participate in this issue.
If they choose not to take up free warrants entitling them to subscribe to this, Eurotunnel said shareholders' interests may be reduced further to just over 39 percent of the company by the end of December 2003.",0
"A thankful Elizabeth Forsyth, a former aide of Polly Peck head Asil Nadir, walked free from court on Thursday after three judges allowed her appeal against a five-year sentence for handling stolen money.
Forsyth, 60, who is also appealing against the money-laundering conviction itself, described her 10 months in prison as an ""experience"".
""I would just like to thank the court for its understanding and consideration,"" Forsyth told reporters as she was freed from the cells of London's Royal Courts of Justice.
She said she could not comment further on the appeal as it was still continuing.
Earlier, the appeal judges surprised the court by making it clear at once that Forsyth would not be returning to spend another night at Holloway prison.
""We have formed a view that this sentence cannot stand,"" Lord Justice Beldam said at the outset of the appeal hearing, adding that the sentence was so disproportionate that, ""taking into account the time she has already served...she should not serve any longer.""
Beldam, hearing the appeal with two other judges, then moved on to consider Forsyth's appeal against her conviction on two counts of dishonestly handling 400,000 pounds ($650,000) of stolen funds.
Forsyth's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, later made a bail application so that Forsyth could be freed pending the outcome of the rest of the appeal.
Forsyth has been in prison since March 1996 when Justice Sir Richard Tucker surprised those following the case with the severity of his sentence.
She was chairman of South Audley Management, a firm set up by Turkish Cypriot Nadir to deal with his wealthy family interests before his Polly Peck empire collapsed in 1990 under a mountain of debt.
During her five-week trial, the jury accepted that Forsyth had helped to launder money that had been stolen from Polly Peck by Nadir.
Nadir still faces charges connected to Polly Peck but in 1993 he fled to northern Cyprus, a territory not recognised by the British government, skipping 3.5 million pounds ($5.67 million) bail.
One of Forsyth's supporters told Reuters outside the court that her 90-year-old mother had been told and was said to be ""well pleased"". At the time of her sentencing, Forsyth's lawyers had argued for leniency saying she should remain outside prison to care for her mother.
Another of Forsyth's lawyers, Peter Krivinskas, said an application by Nadir to have the charges against him dropped would probably depend on the outcome of Forsyth's appeal against her conviction.
The outcome of the original trial was seen as a boost for Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) which prosecutes big fraud cases but has failed to secure convictions in several high-profile cases.",0
"Former Barings executive Ron Baker rejects a lawsuit filed by Dutch bank ING Barings which makes a claim for repayment of a 100,000 pounds ($165,000) loan he is alleged to have received, his lawyer told Reuters on Thursday.
ING Barings earlier confirmed a press report it is suing Baker for 113,000 pounds, representing the loan given while Baker was employed by Barings, plus interest.
It is alleged to have been paid in two 50,000 pounds tranches, the last of which was made just two weeks before the collapse of the bank in February 1995.
""He (Baker) is satisfied that he doesn't owe them (ING Barings) any money,"" Baker's lawyer Lindsay Hill, a partner at Fox Williams, said. ""This doesn't constitute a good claim against Mr Baker.""
Hill said Baker, who was head of financial products at Barings, ""roundly rejects"" the ING claim and says that whatever money was paid to him, it was not sufficient to cover what he was owed.
Asked if Baker was considering making a claim against ING Barings for unpaid money, Hill said his client was currently concentrating on a tribunal hearing where he is challenging charges levelled against him by Britain's Securities and Futures Authority (SFA).
In May, Baker said he was satisfied he had acted properly throughout his time at Barings. He said he was not involved in the bank's agency business through which rogue trader Nick Leeson racked up $1.4 billion losses which bankrupted the blue-blooded investment bank.",0
"Lloyds Bank was fined 325,000 pounds ($550,000) Wednesday by a British investment industry watchdog and appears set to pay millions of pounds in compensation to disadvantaged customers.
The Investment Management Regulatory Organisation said it fined Lloyds, which merged with TSB last year to form Lloyds TSB Group Plc, for breaches of rules relating to its pensions transfer business between April 1988 and June 1993.
Lloyds agreed to a settlement of disciplinary proceedings brought against it, the fifth such settlement IMRO has made with firms that have been found guilty of improper sales of pension products.
IMRO said Lloyds ""did not obtain or have systems to obtain all relevant facts about the personal and financial circumstances of its customers needed to advise them properly about pensions transfers.""
It said Lloyds had not provided certain customers ""with all the information needed to enable them to make a balanced and informed decision on whether to carry out a pension transfer.""
Lloyds, which must pay IMRO's investigation costs of 63,000 pounds ($107,000) and make a contribution to its disciplinary costs, has already offered redress to some customers and the review of some 2,600 Lloyds transfer cases ""is well advanced and will be substantially completed by Dec. 31, 1997,"" IMRO added.
The bank expressed its regret in a statement.
""Lloyds Bank deeply regrets the errors which have resulted in charges being brought against it by IMRO for its pension transfer business,"" it said.
As a group, Lloyds TSB has made provisions totalling 165 million pounds ($279 million) for possible compensation payments to do with the mis-selling of pension products.
These relate to the Lloyds Bank business as well as the pensions activities of TSB before the merger, and of Lloyds' insurance subsidiary Lloyds Abbey Life.
The pension scandal, whereby individuals transferred their pensions and were disadvantaged as a result, has been one of the most serious faced by the British financial services industry in recent years.
The affair knocked a big hole in the public's confidence in the industry and companies are set to pay a price running into hundreds of million of pounds as a result.
In November, Britain's top financial markets regulator the Securities and Investments Board announced a new strategy to try and clear a logjam in the pensions industry's review of the selling of pension products and the payment of compensation to investors.
Both regulators and insurance and investment companies have come under a barrage of criticism over the length of time it has taken to complete a review of cases.
Lloyds said it has identified some 2,600 pension transfer customers of which it anticipates having to pay compensation to around 1,500.",0
"Britain's Serious Fraud Office has yet to contact London-based securities houses after a request for help with a French probe into Eurotunnel SA /Plc share dealings, market sources said on Monday.
The SFO said on Sunday it had been asked to lend a hand in an investigation by the French authorities into alleged market manipulation of the debt-laden channel tunnel operator's shares.
The SFO said it would help in the French probe although it had no grounds to launch an investigation of its own into the dealings which form the basis of the latest Paris investigation.
Securities firms contacted by Reuters on Monday said they had received no approach from the SFO and did not expect to do so. They all said they would co-operate fully if they were approached.
The investigation is another chapter in a troubled corporate story littered with incidents, which earlier this year saw two firms -- Salomon Brothers and Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) -- cleared of insider trading.
The two had been among underwriters of a Eurotunnel rights issue in 1994 and, although never named by Paris stock exchange watchdog the Commission de Operations de Bourse (COB), said that they were under investigation in July last year.
The underwriting group also included Banque Indosuez, Morgan Grenfell, now owned by Deutsche Bank AG, Societe de Banque, Banque Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas, Caisse des Depots, Crdit Agricole, Credit Lyonnais, Robert Fleming, S.G. Warburg (now part of SBC) and Belgian utility Tractebel SA.
About two thirds of Eurotunnel shares are held in France and, as a general rule, more trading in the shares goes on in Paris than in London.
The SFO's usual practise is to issue notices which require a person or institution to be interviewed or hand over documents, although it can also apply for a search warrant if it wants to surprise its target.
On Monday, it remained unclear what period is currently under investigation.
The COB has already investigated the period surrounding the rights issue, though it could be revisiting this highly volatile time.
There have been persistent suggestions that some operators were short-selling at around the time of the rights issue -- forcing the prices down by selling shares they do not own in the hope of buying them back more cheaply later.
Eurotunnel has called on stock exchange authorities on both sides of the Channel to investigate volatile dealings at various times over the years.
Another example was in Agust 1995, when a rogue report that the company had signed a debt rescheduling agreement sent the stock reeling.
The Anglo-French tunnel operator at that time denied it had signed a debt agreement and demanded an inquiry into the trading activity and erroneous reports surrounding its shares and the incident might well be the focus of the French probe.",0
"The British government on Wednesday published new draft legislation governing home lending institutions but a lack of parliamentary time might mean it will not reach the statute book before a general election.
The Building Societies Bill, if passed, would remove a society's five-year immunity from takeover once it converts to bank status if it, in turn, took over another financial institution.
Immunity would not be affected by one of the new banks buying mortgage books or by joint ventures, however.
The draft received a mixed reception from the four societies currently planning to convert themselves into banks.
A Treasury spokeswoman admitted that there was currently no slot for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda but added it remained hopeful an opportunity could arise in the New Year.
""The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,"" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. ""When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.""
The Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($49.97 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government has not taken into account its ""serious concerns"" on the timing of the draft.
""Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,"" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.
If the bill was enacted, she said the Woolwich board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.
In contrast the Northern Rock, also planning a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.
""We are delighted with it,"" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. ""It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you cant ask for more than that.""
The Building Societies Association also welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.
BSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's ""thoughtful compromise"" on the question of takeover protection.
Under current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.
Some societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.
""We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,"" the Treasury said.
The Halifax, the country's biggest home lender has already waived its right to takeover protection by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary.",0

"British property giant Land Securities said on Wednesday there were signs of rental growth in some sectors of the British property market and that it expected more to come.
Company chairman Peter Hunt said that while there was a feeling there was more rental growth to come, so far it had been patchy.
Growth in rental rates would be slower than in the 1980s and because it was not across the board it was crucial to be selective in the properties and developments chosen.
Land on Wednesday reported a pre-tax profit of 128.9 million pounds ($213 million) for the first half, including sales of properties, from 118.1 million pounds last time.
The company, which reported an increased interim dividend of 7.35 pence, said it had plans for ""major shopping centre schemes"" in a number of British towns, including Canterbury, York and Sunderland, as well as ""several proposed new leisure developments"".
The group said the annual level of expenditure on its current development programme was expected to peak during the second half of the financial year.
It said revenue profit, which was down to 115.5 million pounds from 118.2 million pounds for the period, ""is being affected by our prudent policy of not capitalising interest as part of the cost of carrying our substantial programme"".
But it was upbeat on its overall prospects. ""We believe that our strategy of creating growth assets through development will result in a considerable addition to the rental income and capital value of the portfolio in years to come,"" Hunt said.
""Yes, they (the developments) are on target, although you can never be totally sure,"" he added in an interview.
Finance director Jim Murray told Reuters a drop in revenue profit for the half year, to 115.5 million pounds from 118.2 million pounds the previous year, was widely expected and had been flagged in advance.
This reflected the fact that the group was financing a large development programme and was not capitalising interest as part of the cost of carrying this out.
Hunt said property developments continued to be higher yielding business but that most land-owners were holding out on the sale of good land.
""(There is) a much better performance on a development. It is the best growth stock...it's very much in demand. That's why we are concentrating on doing as much development as we can,"" Hunt added.
The group was also buying investments in the ""second-hand"" market. ""We are pursuing both avenues,"" he said, pointing out that Land Securities had recently added the Team Valley Retail Park, south of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to its portfolio.
This would make ""a substantial and valuable addition to our 500 million pound retail warehouse portfolio,"" he said in his chairman's statement.
During the half year the company had bought, or agreed to buy, nearly 80 million pounds of investment properties.
Hunt said he did not think there would be a less favourable environment for the group if Britiain's opposition Labour party won power from the ruling Conservative government at the next general election, due to be held by May 1997.
""I believe the strategies we are pursuing will apply equally within a New Labour environment as in a Conservative (one).""
Hunt said that while he could not comment on possible acquisition targets, the firm looked at ""everything from time to time"" but would have to ""want to own quite a high proportion of the properties"" of any target company before making a bid.",0
"A British High Court judge rejected on Thursday a $1.8 billion claim by the liquidators of Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) against accountancy firm Ernst & Whinney, now known as Ernst & Young.
BCCI was closed by central banks in 1991 and collapsed with debts of more than $12 billion amid evidence of massive fraud and money laundering which has since led to a complex series of court cases, both criminal and civil, in several countries.
Judge Hugh Laddie said the claim by the liquidators of BCCI (Overseas), Deloitte & Touche, that Ernst & Whinney owed a duty of care to the bank was based ""long on assertion and deficient on relevant facts"".
Ernst & Young said the original claim against its predecessor firm was for $10 billion but this was reduced to $3.5 billion in June 1995.
Following this judgement, the principal claim against Ernst & Whinney now stands at around $1.7 billion in respect of the firm's 1985 and 1986 audit of BCCI Holdings SA and BCCI SA.
A similar claim remains outstanding against another international accountancy firm, Price Waterhouse, which took over as auditor to BCCI in 1987 when Ernst & Whinney resigned.
""The BCCI liquidators have now had struck out, or been forced to withdraw, 85 percent of the claims originally brought against Ernst & Whinney,"" said Ernst & Young senior partner Nick Land. ""We look forward to dealing with the remaining 15 percent in a similar fashion and to recovering our costs which are substantial.""
Land attacked the liquidators for choosing to spend millions of pounds pursuing what he called ""speculative and unfounded claims"" rather than making money available to those who suffered losses from the BCCI collapse.
Deloitte & Touche was not immediately available to comment on the judgement.
After a five year struggle, BCCI creditors began to receive payments last month. Deloitte & Touche said it was making a payment of $2.65 billion, equal to 24.5 percent of their claims.
BCCI had assets of $24 billion and operations in 71 countries at the time of the collapse.",0
"Three of Britain's largest bulding societies, which plan stock market flotations in 1997, on Thursday said draft legislation relating to protection from takeovers had forced them to examine their float plans closely.
The mutually-owned societies, who specialise in mortgage lending, the Woolwich, Alliance & Leicester and the Northern Rock, all plan to convert to bank status next year and have combined assets of around 70 billion pounds ($117 billion).
But a change in the draft of a new Building Societies Act has thrown their plans into confusion as the government proposes to change the way converted societies will be treated in the crucial area of takeover bids.
The issue is most pressing for the Alliance & Leicester as it seems highly unlikely that the new draft will be ready before Alliance members meet on December 10 to vote on conversion.
Previously, converting societies were protected by a rule which protected them from takeover for five years after flotation, allowing them to make the transition successfully.
Until now, the only one to have gone through the process is the Abbey National, which converted to a bank in 1989.
Draft legislation is now under consideration although it is doubtful whether there will time for it to become law before next year's general election.
The draft proposes that societies lose their immunity from takeover if they merge with another ""financial institution"" (after flotation) even on an agreed basis.
A Treasury spokeswoman said this did not include the buying of mortgage portfolios from other financial institutions.
The Treasury argues that converting societies should play by the market rules and that the focus of the bill is on those societies who want to remain mutual.
""The loss of the five year protection if any acquisition is undertaken - not just a hostile bid - seems a little unfair,"" Adam Applegarth, director of Northern Rock told Reuters.
The Teasury said it was considering representations to retain immunity in the case of friendly mergers where a large society might merge with a small local institution.
Applegarth said the Northern Rock and other societies were also very concerned at another proposed clause which would allow shareholders of the new company to waive the five year protection, saying this could allow takeovers by the backdoor.
He said a predator might be able to buy up 10 percent of the stock of the company and announce a bid at the same time, calling an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders which would be asked to waive the protection, bypassing the board.
The societies all said the uncertainty was the biggest problem at the moment -- what the bill will say and also when it will be published and whether it will have time to be passed.
""We think that if there is little chance that the bill will be passed, it would be better not to publish it at all, frankly,"" said Applegarth.
The societies have a duty to inform members of all possible relevant information so they can make an informed decision.
The Treasury said it hoped to publish its revised proposals next month regardless of whether the bill is likely to pass into law before the election which must be held by May 1997.
A Woolwich spokeswoman said there was no more than a possibility that the draft bill would delay its float. ""If the rules are changed, then the board would have a duty to reconsider,"" she said.
The other societies took a similar view, but the Alliance & Leicester has a particular problem as its members have already been voting on the change by post.
""At the moment we are steaming ahead, we are on schedule,"" a spokesman for the Alliance said. But he agreed that timing could be affected and confirmed that the Alliance board would discuss the problem at a meeting on Thursday.
The Northern Rock plans to issue its transfer document, to members in early March of next year, but it must be printed in February, leaving little time for the government to produce the finished version of the proposed law ahead of this.",0
"BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays Plc, has restructured its Global Markets division in another step towards reshaping its business to compete wth global rivals, banking sources said on Thursday.
BZW has been carrying out a top-to-bottom review of the markets business including matching staff profiles and skills against the needs of sustaining a profitable business.
The review resulted in around 30 people leaving this week, including Alex von Ungern-Sternberg, deputy chief executive of Global Markets, and Klaus-Peter Moeritz, head of foreign exchange trading in the UK and Europe.
But not all were at such high levels. Those departing also include seven foreign exchange traders, metals traders, secretaries and telephonists.
In an internal memo, Bob Diamond, who has been Global Markets chief since July, said von Ungern-Sternberg had decided to leave after the new structure was put in place as his role ""was substantially narrower.""
Since Bill Harrison joined BZW as chief executive from Robert Fleming there have been the usual personnel changes associated with the investment banking business.
There was no room, for example, for Barclays veteran Donald Brydon who had been running BZW after its previous head, David Band, died earlier in the year.
Harrison and Diamond are thought to be working on methods to make profitability more sustainable -- a quandary which is at the centre of the debate on the investment banking industry.
The industry's detractors, among them Lloyds TSB chief Brian Pitman, always point to the fact that the revenue stream cannot be relied upon as it is subject to market volatility.
In the good times, when markets are booming and mergers and acquisitions on a roll, investment banks rake in profits as if there is no tomorrow and the participants get paid huge bonuses.
But in the bad times, the banks can rack up heavy losses in markets which suddenly look very over-populated.
Diamond, in common with the head of the Barclays group, chief executive Martin Taylor, is known to want to intensify the return on capital employed in the business.
He knows that unless BZW's profits are sustained at high levels, he will find it difficult to put together the kind of team needed to succeed in an increasingly competitive and crowded environment.
No aspect of BZW's markets business from gilts to JGBs (Japanese government bond) and dollar/yen to copper will be left out of the in-depth review, banking sources added.
In the meantime BZW, along with other banks, will also continue to react to more short-term events in the markets.
For example the departure of foreign exchange traders follows a period of reduced volatility in the market over the last few months.
Ironically, such periods of volatility are key to both outperformance and underperformance which dictate returns on capital for investment banks.",0
"Britain's largest mortgage lender, the Halifax Building Society, said Friday its planned initial public offering in June could be worth as much as 12 billion pounds ($20 billion).
Unveiling a price range and details of share allocations to the society's members, Halifax Chief Executive Mike Blackburn said it ""will represent the largest single extension of private share ownership ever witnessed in the UK.""
The mutually-owned Halifax, with assets of over 100 billion pounds ($167.8 million), said flotation adviser Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had estimated a share price of between 390 and 450 pence ($6.54 to $7.55) per share if the IPO had taken place on Dec. 16.
This equals a market worth of between 10.4 billion ($17.5 billion) and 12 billion pounds ($20.1 billion), and analysts expect the final outcome to be at the top end of this range given the recent positive performance of the most comparable stock in the market, former mortgage banker Abbey National Plc.
""The valuation of 12 billion (pounds) is right in line with our expectations,"" said Peter Toeman, banking analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.
Other analysts agreed and many expect the price on flotation day to be higher, saying that Friday's figures looked a little conservative.
The Halifax said each qualifying member will receive a basic allocation of 200 shares in a flotation of 2.675 billion shares.
The Halifax has 6.7 million investing members and two million borrowing members. Of these, there is an overlap 700,000, which means that the Society is sending out a total of around 8.0 million voting packs.
Investing members will also get a variable share allocation depending on how much money they had in their accounts on particular dates. This will range from 200 shares to a maximum of 1,181 for those with 50,000 pounds ($84,430) or more.
At its special general meeting on Feb. 24, over 50 percent of the investing members must vote in favour of the proposal or it will fail. The society has started a huge advertising campaign to encourage members to vote.
The Halifax is expected to be in the top 20 companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip firms and is sure to threaten Abbey's position as Britain's fifth-largest publicly-owned bank.
It said it sees room for huge expansion in the British insurance and long-term savings sectors.",0
"International accountancy and consultancy partnership Ernst & Young said it made a profit of 75.2 million pounds ($125.4 million) in Britain as it revealed financial details of its operations for the first time on Tuesday.
The 21 percent rise in profit in the year to June 30 was made on gross fee income of 456 million pounds and represented a 17 percent rise in average profit per partner of 200,000 pounds.
Ernst & Young's senior partner Nick Land also confirmed that the firm was still planning to become a limited liability partnership registered in the Channel Island of Jersey despite the fact that the government has said it intends to introduce legislation recognising partnerships of this kind in Britain.
Land also said that Ernst & Young's worlwide revenue for the year to September would show a 13 percent rise to $7.8 billion.
Ernst & Young is the world's largest tax accontancy practice and the second largest management comsultancy after Arthur Andersen. It was formed in 1989 from the merger of Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young.
Ernst & Young's move to limited liablity reflects an industry-wide change whereby accountancy firms feel exposed by their current unlimited liablity status, which puts personal assets in jeopardy if the firm were to become insolvent.
Under an LLP, only the capital subscribed by each partner, which currently totals some 72 million pounds, and the personal assets of those partners shown to be directly responsible for any negligent act leading to a loss would be at risk.
Land said there was too much political uncertainty in Britain ahead of next year's general election to rely on British legislation regarding LLPs emerging any time soon.
The firm's move to LLP status is dependent on Jersey's legislation being finally approved and on the LLP's tax status being agreed with Britain's Inland Revenue.
Land said that Ernst & Young's decision to publish its results had not been taken to gain any advantage.
""We are not doing this for any competitive advantage,"" Land said. ""We just thought it was time that we did it.""
He added that Ernst & Young wanted to take a full part in the debate on corporate governance and could hardly do so unless its own financial affairs were transparent.
""Clients are also beginning to ask questions about our financial strength.""
Fastest growth in the past year was shown by Ernst & Young's management consultancy which increased gross fees by 40 percent to 77.4 million pounds.
Only its insolvency practice saw a decline in fees during the year, ironically hit by the recovery in the British economy.",0
"The British government on Wednesday published proposed new laws governing home lenders which watered down the building societies' immunity from takeover if they converted into banks.
The new legislation provoked a cool response from some home lenders and prompted one leading player to say its plans for conversion may well have been different if it had known what the government was planning.
Under the new draft law, a building society  would forfeit its five-year immunity from takeover after it converted to bank status if it took over another financial institution.
The Woolwich, which has assets of just under 30 billion pounds ($50 billion) and plans to float next July, said it was disappointed the government had not taken account of its ""serious concerns"" on the timing of the draft.
""Had our board known when it took the decision to convert that this (change in the law) was even a possibility, then we might have chosen to convert in a different way,"" a spokeswoman for the Woolwich said.
The Treasury acknowledged the new Building Societies Bill might not even make it to the statute book before an election because of a lack of parliamentary time between now and next May, the last date for the polls to be called.
If it went ahead, the Woolwich spokeswoman said the board would have a duty to revisit its conversion plans.
The Alliance & Leicester in a statement also expressed disappointment, and said areas of concern ""have still not been fully resolved.""
""We will now need to move forward while carefully considering outstanding issues,"" the Alliance statement said, noting the move came in the middle of ""a long and costly conversion process"".
In contrast the Northern Rock, a third society which plans a flotation in 1997, welcomed the changes.
""We are delighted with it,"" said Adam Applegarth, a director of the Northern Rock. ""It's a prefectly reasonable compromise and you can't ask for more than that.""
A Treasury spokeswoman said it still hoped to find time for the bill in the Parliamentary agenda in the New Year.
""The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want,"" said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement. ""When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.""
The Building Societies Association welcomed the revised Bill and encouraged its early introduction to Parliament.
BSA chairman Brian Davis, who is also chief executive of the Nationwide Building Society that is not planning to convert, said the BSA fully supported the Treasury's ""thoughtful compromise"" on the question of takeover protection.
Under current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.
Some societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.
""We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable,"" the Treasury said.",0
"Royal Bank of Scotland, which reports full year data next Thursday, is expected to raise its pre-tax profit from last year's 602 million stg but not by as much as analysts thought just a few months ago.
They expect Royal Bank's profits to rise to between 670 and 700 million stg, with a much smaller contribution from its Direct Line low cost insurance, but benefits continuing to accrue from the bank's efforts to reduce costs.
Total dividend is expected to be around 18.6 pence a share versus last year's 16.2p.  
The pre-tax figures will be complicated by an exceptional gain from Royal Bank's disposal of its 50 pct stake in Germany's CC Group, from which it said it would make 70 million stg, and by restructuring costs of around 23 million pounds stemming from an acquisition by its New England subsidiary Citizens.
Forecasts for Direct Line vary widely but analysts are generally pessimistic, with the company's main market -- motor insurance -- going through ""probably the most diffucult period in its history"", as chief executive Ian Chippendale told Reuters in an interview last week.  
""I think Chippendale was sending a strong message,"" said one analyst who declined to be named. ""I think he was softening up the market for a poor set of results.""
Some analysts suspect the results may not be quite as poor as hs been feared by some.
They see the core bank as continuing to perform quite well with the positive results of its ""Project Columbus"" helping costs and income.
David Poutney expects a pre-tax profit of 695 million stg, which includes the exceptional items, while BZW analysts expect 675 million.  
The market received a big clue on the performance of Citizens from the recent results of Bank of Ireland which owns 23 percent of the operation.
""Citizens is doing reasonably well,"" Poutney said, but analysts say it is being affected by the rather lacklustre New England economy.
The market will be expecting improvement in the cost income ratio but analysts say that even an improvement this time will leave the bank plenty of scope for improvement.  
The market will be looking for further clues on lending which showed good growth, mostly in corporate lending area, in the first half.
Inevitably, Royal Bank will also be watched for signs of acquisitions.
It is known to be interested in buying a building society to extend its presence in England but in the current climate, it is unlikely to be willing to pay the high prices likely to be asked.
In any case, analysts say Royal Bank would have to raise cash to be able to perform any major acquisition.  
In the meantime, the market will be looking to its relationship with mutually owned insurance and pensions firm Scottish Widows, which some think may result in an eventual merger.
Royal Bank shares were 15p higher on Friday to stand at 519-1/2p.",0
"British banks have a made a positive start to 1997.
Share prices are buoyant and analysts on Thursday saw few serious clouds on the horizon to jolt the sector out of its seemingly inexorable rise.
The sctor, which has outperformed the FTSE 100 index by around 20 percent over the past six months, has become more diverse in recent years.
But, for differing reasons, analysts are quietly confident that based on a benign economic environment, the banks should continue to show good profit growth.
There are also positive stories to be told on an individual basis with Barclays and National Westminster, for example, expected to offer further share buybacks and HSBC and Standard Chartered set to continue reaping the benefits of their strong Far East franchise.
""The Far East is still looking attractive and we still have Standard Chartered on an outperform rating,"" said Nick Collier, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. ""We also like Natwest, it's the cheapest stock in the sector, and looks likely to emerge with a more compelling story in 1997,""
Analysts expect NatWest to consolidate its recent heavy acquisition programme and spend possibly 300 million pounds on buying back shares as its Tier One capital ratio measure rises. Barclays is also expected to continue repurchases on which it has already spent around one billion pounds.
Lloyds TSB could also eventually join the share buy-back club as its capital ratios improve, though most analysts do not see this happening before 1998.
Salomon Brothers banking analyst John Leonard said he expects the British economic outlook to remain favourable.
The strength of sterling, while affecting those banks that report dollar income in sterling, looks set to keep the lid on inflation and interest rates, a scenario the banks should be able to deal with.
If rates were to rise more than expected then that could be a problem for bank share prices if the market thought bad debt provisions were set to rise.
On the other hand, many analysts are not convinced by the link between interest rates and bank share prices.
""It's sometimes dificult to tell what causes prices to fall from the outside,"" said one analyst who declined to be named. ""Bank shares have done very well in recent years and operators may well take profits on any (market) setback to lock them away. But that doesn't mean they have changed their view.""
On domestic banking, analysts are happy that banks have been moving more into higher-margin personal sector borrowing at the expense of the lower margins seen in the corporate sector.
But they are less happy about the competitive mortgage market which, despite an upturn, is hardly setting the world alight.
While bad debts remain stable, net bad debt charges could rise as releases of old provisions work their way out of the system.
Other share markets could also have an influence, analysts say.
Some investors compare the British and U.S. bank sectors and last year, the U.S. rather lost out. If this were to turn, then the British banks could come under some pressure, said Salomon's Leonard.
But analysts are already a little nervous given that the banks' good run has continued with such strength.
""Some stocks are definitely looking less compelling given the rush of blood we've seen in the New Year,"" said one.",0
"British bank Barclays Tuesday sold its global custody business to investment bank Morgan Stanley for an undisclosed sum thought to be less than 50 million British pounds ($83 million).
The purchase by Morgan Stanley marks another step in the consolidation of custody business, which is increasingly being seen as a banking activity where ""big is beautiful.""
The custody business includes traditional safekeeping of securities, increasingly electronically, performance measurement and stock lending.
""Barclays believes global custody has become very much a ... business requiring substantial investment in technology,"" said Chief Executive Martin Taylor.
A Barclays spokeswoman said the investment in technology would be considerable and that Barclays had decided this would not be an effective investment.
Sir David Walker, chairman of Morgan Stanley Europe, said, ""This transaction enables us to offer a broader range of products to our clients. It will strengthen Morgan Stanley's global franchise, particularly in Europe, and will increase our fee-based revenues.""
Morgan Stanley said the combined custody assets of the two business would amount to some $390 million, taking it up the global custody ladder dominated by large American players.
The list is headed by Chase Manhattan, which has more than $1 trillion in assets in custody, followed by Citibank, Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank, the largest European player, and State Street Boston.
Barclays had Britain's largest custody business, followed by Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland.
Barclays Global Custody employs some 488 staff members worldwide, of which only those in sales, relationship management, marketing and client support will be moving to Morgan Stanley -- considerably fewer than half of the total.
Barclays employee union UNIFI said only 67 of the staff would transfer with the business.
Analysts said Morgan Stanley was thought to have paid less than 50 million pounds ($83 million) for the business, but the banks said a final price would not be fixed for some time. The deal is expected to be closed at the beginnning of April 1997.",0
"NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank, on Monday named Peter Hall as the man to run its expanding operations but other questions over the bank's strategy remained, analysts said.
NatWest said Hall, who currently runs its American operations, would take over as chief operating officer of the investment bank, reporting to chief executive Martin Owen.
At the same time, NatWest Markets said it would streamline origination and distribution functions into one Global Financial Markets division from the current capital markets and treasury divisions.
NatWest said no job losses would result from the consolidation.
The bank has been on the acquisition trail recently, buying corporate finance boutique J O Hambro Magan in October, spending $590 million on U.S. primary dealer Greenwich Capital and 472 million pounds on Gartmore, the British fund manager. It also acquired U.S. merger and acquisitions specialist Gleacher for $135 million.
But analysts have expressed concern that NatWest will find it difficult to bring these all together, despite the fact that the businesses seem to compliment each other.
Some feel that NatWest is spending large amounts of cash on buying businesses that could be near the top of their business cycle.
""The NatWest markets business is robust and it can make returns while it is still building,"" said one analyst. ""But a revenue downturn will tend to hit the players who are building rather than those who are already established.""
Currently, investment banks are enjoying generally the low-inflation, steady growth conditions seen in many major economies with an accompanying healthy amount of mergers and acquisitions activity.
But a substantial downturn on Wall Street, predicted by many strategists, could leave some high-cost acquisitions looking a little less appetizing, analysts say.
Owen said the fast growth of NatWest markets, both organically and by acquisition, had led him to the conclusion that the day-to-day operational management should be separated from strategy, client development and financial supervision.
""As President and COO, Peter will be charged with implementing our operational plan, leaving me more time to work with global product heads to shape our strategies,"" Owen said.
Analysts were happy that NatWest had brought an insider to the job.
""Sometimes it gets difficult to keep continuity and things can start to fall apart,"" said one analyst. ""I would class this appointment as continuity, so that's good.""",0
"After a five year struggle, creditors of the collapsed, fraud-ridden BCCI will receive a payment of $2.65 billion on Tuesday, equal to 24.5 percent of their claims, a spokesman for the liquidators said on Monday.
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, founded in 1972, was closed by central banks in 1991 and collapsed with debts of more than $12 billion when evidence of massive fraud and money laundering was unearthed leading to a tangled web of litigation which shows no sign of reaching an early conclusion.
BCCI had assets of $24 billion and operations in 71 countries at the time of its collapse.
Liquidator Deloitte and Touche said a further payment, reportedly of 10 percent, of the admitted claims which total some $10.5 billion should be made in the next 12 to 16 months.
The gross fund of amounts recovered by the liquidators stands at around $4.0 billion and includes $1.5 billion paid by BCCI's majority shareholder, the government of Abu Dhabi, which will pay a further $250 million in due course following a settlement reached earlier this year.
This, in addition to efforts by US authorities which resulted in the recovery of more than $500 million from the United States paved the way for the first dividend payment.
A further $245 million was paid by Saudi billionaire Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz who the liquidators alleged was involved in covering up the BCCI scandal. Under a 1995 Luxembourg court settlement, Mahfouz agreed to pay without admitting liability, in return for the lawsuits being dropped.
The liquidators still have outstanding claims against the Bank of England, the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois (BCCI's operations were based in Luxembourgh) and the auditors of the bank, international accountancy firms Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Whinney, now part of the merged Ernst & Young.
Price Waterhouse has said it is making a multi-billion dollar counter claim against Abu Dhabi.
Further law suits are also pending around the world in an attempt to recover further amounts.
The two biggest groups of creditors of BCCI are in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and in Britain.
The English liquidators of BCCI, Deloite & Touche, have recovered over $1 billion and have been paid a massive $200 million in fees.
In a report to the High Court earlier this year, the liquidator said legal fees in the liquidation ammounted to over $75 million so far.",0
"BZW, the investment banking arm of Barclays Plc, said on Wednesday it plans to use state-of-the-art defence technology to help it with a perennial problem -- managing risk in the financial markets.
The bank has formed the Financial Laboratory Club to develop new risk management solutions, using the scientific and computing potential of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency of the British Ministry of Defence -- the biggest research and development organisation in Western Europe.
Also involved in the project, which has funding of 1.8 million pounds ($3.0 million) for the first two years, are Silicon Graphics, insurance company Royal Sun Alliance, the London Stock Exchange, the City University and Business School and risk management consultancy Z/Yen.
The British government is providing a grant of 750,000 pounds for the project and BZW is putting in 500,000 over two years.
With margins getting ever finer in the highly competitive investment banking world, BZW hopes defence technology can help it keep ahead.
""We have to manage our risk well,"" said Martin Dooney, global head of money markets at BZW. ""We want to start setting the standard and make strides to be ahead of the pack.""
Dooney and DERA scientists believe there is enough common ground between the worlds of the trading room and the battlefield to make the exercise worthwhile.
""The risks are obviously different,"" he said. ""For the crew of a main battle tank it could be the missile defences of the opposing force and for the bond trader it could be the movement of short-term interest rates.""
But Dooney said there are many similarities, not least the fact that that both are high-stress environments which both require the sophisticated modelling and simulation techniques which have, until now, been largely the preserve of the defence industries.
One reason for this is that research into this field needs massive computing power which DERA can provide via its four Cray Computer Corp super-computers which are millions of times more powerful than the average desktop PC.
BZW believes the project can help people at every level in the company to better understand the firm's risk position by replacing a mass of numbers by visualisation techniques.
The project will also look into using modelling techniques used to develop military consoles to look at the design of future trading stations and try to develop different ways of evaluating dealer performance.
This will, in particular, provide early warning of problems based on trading pattern evidence.
""The financial services industry wants something that it can use in the heat of battle,"" said Michael Mainelli, development director at DERA.
""If financial markets are destabilised they could be as, or even more, damaging than a conventional war.""

In an interview, Anysoft founder Poreh said the company's team of software programmers was handpicked from among top professors and graduate students at leading Israeli universities, including Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology.
Industry analysts briefed on the technology hailed it as a decisive breakthrough, based on its potential to liberate computer users from dependence on any single operating system, such as Microsoft Corp.'s Windows.
""This is certainly one of the most significant technologies I've seen in the past five years,"" said veteran industry analyst Tim Bajarin, who heads Creative Strategies, a San Jose, Calif.-based consulting firm.
""What Anysoft has done is taken software interoperability beyond a forced Windows-X86 environment,"" Barjarin said, referring to the ruling combination of Microsoft software and Intel Corp. software and hardware systems.
Nonetheless, Anysoft's audacious goal is set against a history of failed industry attempts to create a universally accepted format capable of handling all types of computer data.
In recent years, leading computer makers like International Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co. have rallied around a common software compabability standard known as CORBA.
However, this and similar initiatives have been hamstrung by competitive rivalries among industry players and the belief that programmers must unify around a single standard for creating software.
Microsoft's own effort at ushering in a ""Golden Age"" of software compatability has gone by several names, such as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and ActiveX, its Internet-based compatability standard.
But Microsoft's efforts have met with foot-dragging by companies unwilling to cede the software giant any more standard-setting power than it already has.
By contrast, the ANY concept is based on the seemingly simple idea that the only univeral information from different operating systems is what computer users see displayed on a screen.
""The screen is the only standard that everyone is using,"" Poreh maintained.
Anysoft has created software extensions that give computer users the perception of compatibility without having to address underlying programming differences that have ensnared previous efforts, he said.
Anysoft's go-it-alone strategy depends on seeding its technology widely among software companies, Internet service providers and large corporations developing their own software applications, all of which might include Anysoft's universal data routing features in their own products.
Consumers would have to wait until products using the technology become available from these companies.
Poreh said he plans to charge companies using Anysoft technology in their products a licensing fee starting at around $20,000 and running up to $400,000, depending on the potential number of users of the product.
In addition, Poreh said Anysoft plans to ask for a royalty of 1 percent to 3 percent, or a flat fee, again depending on the potential number of customers.
ANY technology is designed to extend software systems such as Windows or Lotus Notes, and existing compatibility programs such as Adobe Systems Inc.'s  Acrobat, Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java or even the Internet, rather than replace them, Anysoft officials said.
Anysoft said it has held licensing talks with five of the world's top 10 independent software development companies, including IBM.
Poreh said IBM's main interest appeared to be in using ANY technology to recover data from so-called ""legacy"" applications running on older mainframe computers where the underlying software is no longer being actively maintained.
ANY technology currently works with software running on Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The technology is in the process of being made compatible with Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh, IBM's OS/2 and the Unix-based X/Windows operating system, company officials said.",0
"Microcom Inc and Rockwell Semiconductor Systems said Wednesday they plan to beef up their technology partnership to speed development of higher speed 56-kilobit modems for central switch equipment.
The 56 kilobit modems would allow computer users to connect to the Internet at speeds nearly double the rate of current 28.8 kilobit modems now available using standard phone lines.
The deal builds on a decade-old product development partnership between Microcom and Rockwell. Rockwell Semiconductor is a unit of Rockwell International Corp.  
New Microcom central site switch equipment would give the receiving end -- phone carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and corporate central offices -- the capacity to handle incoming calls from computers with 56 kilobit modems.
""It increases the market scope of Rockwell's 56k offering,"" said Prudential analyst Jim Thayer of Rockwell's 56 kilobit modem plans. He maintains a buy rating on Microcom.
However, Hambrecht & Quist analyst Rakesh Sood said the Microcom/Rockwell pact was a defensive response to a U.S. Robotics Inc initiative already well under way by the company to offer its own set of 56 kilobit modem products.  
In the Rockwell/Microcom pact, Rockwell will contribute its K56Plus modem chipset to the venture, while Microcom will offer its Modemware technology, a software interface that other equipment providers license to build their own modems.
To speed 56k development, Rockwell said it is opening an East Coast development center with 15 to 20 Rockwell engineers working alongside Microcom staff. The center will initially be at Microcom's headquarters in Norwood, Massachusetts. Rockwell is based in Seal Beach, Calif.  
As part of the partnership, Rockwell and Microcom are working together to drive standards development of a new high speed modem standard that would incorporate Microcom's MNP (Microcom Networking Protocol) standard.
Modems based on the Rockwell chip design would not be compatible with those from Robotics until an industry-wide standard for compatability can be hammered out, which no industry player seriously expects before 1998.  
In the intervening period, modems based on Rockwell's standard will work only with central office switches from partners such as Microcom, while Robotics modems will work only with equipment offered by backers of its standard.
U.S. Robotics has licensed its X2 56 kilobit technology to chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc and Cirrus Logic Inc and to modem supplier Cardinal Technologies Inc CRTK.O.
Robotics plans to introduce 56 kilobit modems in January and remote access equipment in February, a spokeswoman said.
Rockwell's own 56 kilobit plans have been slower getting off the ground, but the company has said it too plans to introduce new 56k modems in the first quarter of 1997.  
Nonetheless, Rockwell's technology has been embraced by Ascend Communications Inc and consumer modem makers Boca Research Inc, Hayes Microcomputer Inc and Zoom Telephonics Inc, who are unhappy doing business with rival U.S. Robotics Inc, the dominant consumer modem supplier.
Microcom said it plans to incorporate the Rockwell K56Plus technology into central site modem systems that it sells both directly and indirectly, through partnerships with Cisco Systems Inc, Bay Networks Inc, Digital Equipment Corp and Gandalf Technologies INc.  
Microcom officials said they expect Rockwell/Microcom modems to be adopted by many network equipment makers who fear relying on Robotics, which is seen as a competitive threat.
Microcom said products based the Rockwell design will be available for test and evaluation early in 1997 and that finished products will ship in central site and remote modem equipment by late in the first quarter of 1997.
Thayer argued the schism over standards should buy time for the Rockwell camp and may allow it to gain market share from Robotics due to Rockwell's wider base of support.
""They should have a fairly high share of 56 kilobit market over time,"" Thayer said of the Rockwell/Microcom partnership.
However, Sood argues the market for 56 kilobit modems will come largely from home computer users not office workers, who have access to other high-speed communications alternatives.
This plays to U.S. Robotics' strength as an equipment supplier to a majority of the top 10 Internet access providers aimed at consumers, like America Online Inc and Netcom On-line Communications Inc, Sood said.",0
"Computer distribution powerhouse Ingram Micro Inc. is set to hold its widely anticipated initial public offering on Wall Street Thursday despite some last-minute delays, including management changes.
""We haven't seen anything comparable in the technology sector with its kind of name this year,"" said Manish Shah, editor and publisher of the IPO Maven, of the new issue.
Anticipating heavy demand, the estimated price on Ingram's 20 million share offering was boosted to $17 to $19 a share Wednesday from $14 to $16, said underwriter Morgan Stanley.  
As the world's leading distributor of computer hardware, software and networking equipment to corporate resellers and computer retailers, Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram is a veritable steam-engine of computer industry growth.
There are really only three world-class distributors of computer products: Ingram, with revenues expected to hit roughly $10 billion this year, Merisel Inc. with $6 billion and Tech Data Corp. at $4 billion.  
That size advantage is crucial said Seymour Merrin, a leading industry analyst, who heads Merrin Information Services Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Market share isn't just an important factor,"" Merrin said. ""It's the only factor.""
Ingram's suppliers read like a Who's Who of the leading computer brands -- names like IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Novell and U.S. Robotics. And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.
Its main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.  
""Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,"" Shah said.
Underlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.
Companies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.  
In one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.
Ingram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.
The company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.  
An anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood ""Chip"" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.
Ingram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.
But any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.  
""It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,"" said Shah for shares of the stock. ""I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,"" he added.  
In an industry known for its love of jargon, computer business insiders speak with a mix of reverential awe about ""the Channel"" - short for distribution channel and the delivery mechanism that has make-or-break control over the future of any computer product.
Ingram is to ""the Channel"" what Microsoft is to software, Intel is to microprocessors and Cisco is to networking.",0
"Bay Networks Inc shares bounded higher on Wednesday on news the company had named a senior Intel Corp official as chairman and chief executive, a move analysts said could give Bay the strong hand it has lacked.
""It's quite a positive,"" said Bear Stearns networking analyst Eric Blachno of the long-time Intel executive David House's selection. ""It's good to know the company is not going to be rudderless.""  
Bay shares gained 1-3/4 to 20-1/8 on Wednesday, rising from their 52-week basement.
The shares were among the five most active on the NYSE.
Blachno said he will remain on the sidelines before once again backing the stock until he sees what strategies House may have in store to return Bay to prominence within the networking industry.
The analyst downgraded the stock to neutral from buy after Bay's last earnings report, which he said included ""ominous"" signs of trouble in the company switching business, which accounts for about 20 percent revenues.  
Bay's switch business has shown sequential declines in revenues for the last two quarters, even as rivals Cisco Systems Inc and 3Com Corp have delivered double-digit growth on larger revenue bases, Blachno noted.
Despite its reputation as a technology leader in the networking industry, Bay's finanical performance has marked it as a laggard within the group over the last several years.
By contrast, Cisco and 3Com have positioned themselves in front of an avalanche of demand for networking products and their shares have reflected that success.  
Wall Street analysts have complained that the company has suffered from a crisis of leadership in recent months.
Leadership has been an issue for Bay ever since it was formed by the merger of Wellfleet and Synoptics and 1994.
Analysts said difficulties encountered in combining the predecessor companies' product lines became magnified by an attempt to operate the companies out of headquarters on two coasts: in Santa Clara, Calif. and Billerica, Mass.
The hiring of David House as chairman, president and CEO consolidates in one leader's hands the role of chairman, which had been held by Paul Severino founder of Wellfleet, and former chief executive Andrew Ludwick, a founder of Synoptics.
Severino remains a director of the company and is expected to play an important role in defining technology strategy.
Ludwick resigned two weeks ago from the company, following several months of speculation that he planned to leave.
""We continue to believe Bay is going to be a long-term player and one of the leading companies in its industry,"" said Blachno, adding that, ""Of course, it will take some time before the new leader maps his course.""",0
"Intel Corp shares slid another four points on Friday, continuing a three-day retreat triggered by smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc's statement that its turnaround plan is on track.
But analysts and money managers were unruffled by what they said was profit-taking in Intel and a temporary shift among some momentum investors to AMD and away from Intel.
Intel stock has lost about six percent of its value since Wednesday, when Advanced Micro said it was sampling its Pentium-like K6 chip, which its expect to ship in early 1997.  
Intel closed at 115-7/8, down 4, on volume of 15 million shares, marking it as the most active Nasdaq stock. Intel, a key component in the Nasdaq Composite index, has acted as a drag on the market even as the NYSE has hit new record highs.
The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 1261.81, off 8.55.
Edwin Turney, a Silicon Valley-based technology money manager who runs the Panagea fund, agreed, saying: ""You have a lot of profit-taking and then you have got the momentum players who have had a hell of a run in the last 6 months.
""So now they are looking at the secondary players,"" Turney said, referring specifically to Advanced Micro.  
""AMD has been a catalyst for other people to take profit,"" agreed Merrill Lynch semiconductor analyst Thomas Kurlak.
""There is really nothing specifically to explain (Intel's recent decline). It's just another wiggle in the chart.""
Soundview President James Townsend agreed AMD's announcement may have provided an excuse for some investors to temporarily shift out of Intel.
""With a stock that has been this incredibly successful, it may be enough to take some profits off the table,"" Townsend said. He was referring to Intel's impressive 50 point rise to new record levels since mid-summer.  
AMD stock has languished in recent years after repeated failures to match Intel's Pentium technology. However, since Wednesday, the stock has gained more than 20 percent. It closed at 25-1/8, up 1/2 point on the day on Friday.
Analysts said AMD's new K6 chips are not compatible with Intel latest Pentium Pro chips, but the chip could do a healthy business as a simple Pentium alternative.
""There's clearly room enough for both companies to do well,"" said C.B. Lee, an analyst at Hancock Institutional Partners, who follows both Intel and AMD.  
""Clearly, AMD has had some impact in the minds of some investors,"" Lee said of Intel's declines in recent days, but added: ""In my mind AMD is not a threat.""
Analysts expect Intel to produce 20 million Pentium microprocessors in the current quarter, while AMD will build only a tiny fraction of that number -- and less powerful processers at that.
Like most chip sector securities analysts, Kurlak maintains a strong buy on Intel and a neutral rating on AMD.
Lee said he also remains neutral on AMD, ""but its back in my good graces"" with its plans to introduce the K6 chip.
In the last week, Prudential Securities analyst Mark Edelstone was alone among Wall Street analysts in upgrading AMD to a buy from a hold in response to the K6 announcement.",0
"General Electric Co Chairman John Welch was upbeat about GE's prospects for the current year and beyond during a private meeting with Wall Street analysts, several of those who attended said on Tuesday.
In particular, Welch told analysts he was comfortable with current Wall Street estimates for the 1996 calendar year. The First Call consensus is $4.40 per share for the year.
Salomon Brothers analyst Russell Leavit said the GE executive had said on Monday he ""expected earnings to be up about 13 percent this year, in line with expectations.""  
Analysts said the meeting with analysts helped propel General Electric stock on to the NYSE most actives list on Tuesday. The stock was up 1-1/8 in early afternoon trading after gaining more than two points earlier in the day.
A GE spokesman declined to comment on Welch's remarks to analysts. He said the company had gone on record in its third-quarter earnings report, released October 10, as being on track for a ""record year"" in 1996 in terms of earnings.
After the meeting, CS First Boston said analyst Martin Sankey reiterated his strong buy on GE and boosted his 1997 earnings estimate by a nickel to $5.00 per share.  
""They are looking for good progress next year,"" Leavitt said of Monday's meeting, one of the company's regular briefings with Wall Street analysts.
While litle new was disclosed at the meeting, ""there seems to be a high level of conviction that progress is in place,"" the analyst said.
GE's leader specifically cited the company's aircraft engine and power businesses as being well-positioned for growth in the coming year, along with its NBC broadcast unit, Leavitt said.
Leavitt retained his buy rating after the meeting and left his current estimates intact. He said he expected GE to report earnings of $4.40 for 1996 and $4.95 per share for 1997, which is a penny above the First Call consensus.
""Most of the Wall Street analysts came away comfortable that the earnings estimates will be realized this year and next year,"" one fund manager said. ""It's his usual magic with Wall Street,"" a reference to Welch's popularity.",0
"America Online Inc.'s new flat-rate pricing plan and moves to meet spiraling subscriber demand suggest it is on track to become a major media player, comparable to broadcast or cable TV networks, analysts said Tuesday.
Analysts cautioned, however, that underlying this success loomed a real threat that the online network's capacity to serve its more than 7 million subscribers could soon be overwhelmed.
They warned that the additional demand on AOL's network generated by the company's offer of unlimited usage for $19.95 per month imperilled its near-term capacity to handle demand.
If only a small fraction of AOL's millions of subscribers were to take up the company's offer of unlimited access and remain connected to the service for long periods of the day, the service would quickly grind to a halt, detractors said.
Clearly, investors are betting the company can surmount such challenges, as AOL has done repeatedly in mushrooming sevenfold from less than 1 million users three years ago.
In recent weeks, the stock's momentum has revived, doubling from a year-low of $22 to reach $44 earlier Tuesday. An afternoon sell-off caused the stock to fall back to $37.50. down $2.375.
""The market appears to have taken a very bullish view of the new pricing scheme,"" said Arthur Newman, an analyst with brokerage firm Gerard Klauer of the stock's recent run-up.
""But you have to balance this with the realisation that the more time users spend online, the higher the cost of adding capacity"" requiring new equipment investments, he said.
AOL officials have warned repeatedly that they expect the next two quarters to be transitional ones, both operationally and financially, as the company seeks to gain revenues from advertising and commercial transactions instead of mainly subscriber fees.
But Abishek Gami, an analyst with Nesbitt Burns Securities, said he believed AOL had proven its capacity to weather the pressures of the explosively growing online medium.
In particular, Gami said AOL has measures in place to limit excessive connection times by users who now have little incentive to disconnect and free up network time for other users.
""Will this demand on its network be enough to destroy the company? I think not,"" said Gami. ""What the company will do is build out to meet demand and stage a comeback,"" said the analyst.
""Anyone who is writing this company's obituary is going to be disappointed,"" agreed Gary Arlen, an online industry analyst at Arlen Communications Inc.
AOL said Monday it was greatly expanding its online network and planned to spend $250 million by next June to double its network capacity and improve service.",0
"CompuServe Corp., acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, said Thursday it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and focus on its business and technical customers.
The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs.
The company said it would pursue businesses with higher profit margins, including international consumer markets, espcially those in Europe.
""For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
""CompuServe will never contend for the king's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,"" he said.
CompuServe officials stressed no layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total head count stands at about 3,200 worldwide.
The company laid off 150 employees, or 4 percent of its work force, in an earlier cutback announced last summer.
CompuServe's moves come on the heels of recent aggressive actions by rival America Online Inc. to stay on top by offering a series of new pricing options, including a flat monthly rate of $19.95, and by shutting down its direct Internet access service.
Since CompuServe's parent, H&R Block Inc., sold 20 percent of the online service to the public in April, CompuServe has struggled to keep up with America Online, the largest online service, and with a host of Internet-based competitors.
America Online has more than 7 million subscribers. As of Oct. 31, CompuServe said it had 3.3 million direct worldwide subscribers. NiftyServe, its Japanese licensee, had a total of 5.3 million, roughly the same level as in July.
In reaction to CompuServe's continuing troubles, H&R Block in August shelved plans to spin off the 80 percent of CompuServe it still owns.
Since CompuServe's initial public stock offering in April, its prospects have dimmed, with its stock tumbling from an initial price of $30 a share. The stock fell 94 cents Thursday to $10.69 on Nasdaq.
Earlier Thursday, H&R reported a substantial loss for its second quarter ended Oct. 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil.
Krasilovsky said CompuServe's plan to go back to basics was ""very realistic,"" but added ""too bad they didn't do it a year-and-a-half ago.""
The analyst said he expects the company to reposition itself to provide niche services to business customers who don't want to pay for a high-level premium online service.
In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway said that while his company was abandoning further mass-marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, ""If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.""
Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would target its efforts and investments at business and professional users, its traditional strength.
Wow! was introduced seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground. Wow! customers numbered 102,000 at latest count, the company said.
The company blamed the failure of Wow! on new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.
The company also said it plans to launch early next year a new ""CompuServe for Business"" service, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new interface and added content from ""thousands"" of information providers.
Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas where CompuServe's brand is the best recognised name among online and Internet access providers.
In Europe, for example, CompuServe said subscribers to its main CompuServe Interactive online service had nearly doubled to more than 800,000 in the past year.",0
"MCI Communications Corp. said Monday it reached a 10-year deal with NextWave Telecom Inc. that thrusts MCI into the top tier of U.S. wireless communications providers.
Under terms of the deal, MCI said it will connect its network to a system planned by NextWave to provide personal communications services, giving it the capacity to offer service to more than 110 million individuals in 63 areas, including 29 of the top 50 markets.
Washington-based MCI said it will buy at least 10 billion minutes of capacity for its personal communications services from NextWave over 10 years. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Personal communications services represent the new generation of celluar communications services, allowing customers to send both voice and data transmissions over wireless telephones.
The deal will help underpin the financial future of debt-laden NextWave, which was the largest bidder in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's auctions for ""C-band"" wireless radio spectrum held in early July.
NextWave, based in San Diego and New York, also plans to sell stock to the public.
For MCI, the deal enables it to expand quickly into the rapidly growing market for wireless personal communications services.
Two years ago, MCI dropped out of the auctions for U.S. PCS licences after the bidding became too rich for its taste.
But with the NextWave pact and previous smaller deals, MCI has moved to become a major reseller of wireless services.
As part of the deal, NextWave selected MCI to provide telecommunications and other services supporting the development and ongoing operations of its personal communications services system, MCI said.
""This agreement with NextWave establishes an immediate nationwide PCS footprint for MCI and represents an important next step in MCI's wireless strategy,"" said Whitey Bluestein, vice president for MCI wireless strategy and development.
""This is the first full interconnection agreement of its kind and brings new competition to the wireless marketplace,"" he said, noting that with full interconnection, MCI does not need to own its own wireless facilities.
MCI said the NextWave agreement is a model for additional agreements it expects to sign with other wireless providers as part of its wireless interconnected network strategy.
The strategy is MCI's blueprint for developing a full range of wireless services and features that will be integrated into MCI's existing communications services.
""This was MCI's strategy all along,"" said Jeffrey Kagan, an Atlanta-based telecommunications industry analyst.
Kagan said MCI has historically preferred to resell communications services initially rather than investing in its own infrastructure. Over time, the company selectively builds its own infrastructure as it proves profitable to do so.
""Reselling service was how they became a heavy hitter in long distance in the first place,"" Kagan said. ""What their plan is, is to resell service from other providers and build networks where they see the need to do so,"" he said.
Kagan said MCI's deal with NextWave marks the rapid realisation of its reseller strategy. ""This all of a sudden puts MCI on the wireless communications map in a big way.""
Still, he noted that AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Wireless unit, the former McCaw Cellular business, remains twice as large as MCI's cellular business, with about 6.5 million subscribers in geographic regions covering 207 million potential customers.
MCI's deal with NextWave covers about 110 million potential customers living in a mix of metropolitan and less-densely populated areas.
MCI's stock traded at $25.25 a share Monday, down 25 cents, on Nasdaq.",0
"Computer Associates International Inc. issued its quarterly financial results, soundly beating Wall Street's consensus forecast.
But the stock fell sharply Wednesday morning after company executives told securities analysts they planned to acclerate investments in its personal computer-based corporate software products and de-emphasise mainframe software sales.
Analysts also said some investors were spooked by a slowdown in the company's international sales, which fell about 5 percent in the latest quarter ended in September compared to a year ago.
Computer Associates shares lost more than than $4 in early trading but regained some ground later in the day after several analysts reaffirmed ""buy"" ratings on the stock and raised their future earnings projections on the company.
The stock closed at $62.875, down $2.75 on the day, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
In a phone interview, Computer Associates President Sanjay Kumar confirmed the company planned to increase its investments in its PC-related mid-range software business.
""In reality, (mid-range software) is the right place to be,"" Kumar said of the company's planned shift in emphasis. ""It is the high-growth business.""
The executive said mid-range software amounted to about 31 percent of overall revenue in the latest quarter and was the fastest-growing portion of its business, with sales rising 56 percent above last year's September quarter, he said.
""What we neeed to do is engineer the business to move in that direction,"" Kumar said.
But mainframe software continues to account for more than twice the revenues of mid-range products, or 63 percent of the latest quarter's total reveneues of $990 million.
Mainframe sales rose 10 percent compared to the year-ago quarter, a rate Kumar said he expected would continue.
The remaining 6 percent of revenues derived from its small consumer accounting software and systems integration business.
Computer Associates has long been the world's leading supplier of mainframe software, but in recent years has sought to extend this dominance throughout corporate organisations by developing software used to manage personal computers.
This shift in focus to the smaller, albeit faster-growing part of its business prompted fears among some investors that Computer Assocites was entering a complicated transition.
""In general, you have to be concerned when a company says that it is going to be de-emphasising a part of its business that amounts to 60 percent of (its) revenues,"" said UBS Securities analyst Joe Farley.
But Farley discounted such concerns, saying the company's move came as no surprise to long-time observers of the business software maker. He embraced the choice to accelerate the company's commitment to the newer, higher-growth business.
""Their actions have already indicated that they are moving that way,"" Farley said of Computer Associates' increasing shift to PC-based mid-range products. ""Their words are following their actions,"" he said.
Kumar said the company contemplated a ""smooth transition"" over the next two years.
Mid-range sales will ""cross the threshold in fiscal 1998 probably"" and become the dominant source of revenue, he said.
In the interview, Kumar also said he expected the company to take a charge ""in the $500 million range"" related to a writedown of assets in its planned acquisition of Cheyenne Software Inc. during the current quarter ending in December.
The company began a $30.50 per share cash tender offer last Friday for Cheyenne.
The company expects the total cost of the Cheyenne acquisition to come to $1.2 billion, which it plans to fund through a combination of cash reserves and existing credit.",0
"H&R Block Inc., citing problems facing the online service industry, said Wednesday it has decided not to complete the spin-off of the rest of its CompuServe online unit, at least for now.
The Kansas City, Mo.-based company, which owns 80 percent of CompuServe after spinning off part of the online service earlier this year, cited CompuServe's recent financial troubles and uncertainties facing the online industry.
Industry analysts said the problems reflect the changes rippling through the online industry but were also partly unique to Columbus, Ohio-based Compuserve, which has about 5.2 million subscribers, slightly more than half of them outside of the United States.
America Online Inc., the largest with more than 6 million subscribers, No. 2 Compuserve and Prodigy have all been hurt as users have gone directly to the Internet with lower-cost Internet access providers rather than online services.
Some analysts have said that the online services, which offer packages of specialised information as well as Internet access, may not survive in the long run, though the eventual shape of the online industry remains far from certain.
""A lot of the people are going to read this as the online market is at a crossroads and pretty shaky,"" said one analyst who follows the industry.
H&R Block spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April and had planned to distribute the rest to its shareholders.
But it said Wednesday that it has decided not to present the proposed spin-off of the rest of CompuServe to shareholders at its annual meeting scheduled for Sept. 11.
""The board continues to believe that a separation of CompuServe is in the best interests of H&R Block shareholders and will continue to consider the matter,"" H&R Block interim President Frank Salizzoni said.
CompuServe's stock has dropped from a high of $35.50 on its first day of trading to near $10 recently. The stock rose after Wednesday's announcement because new CompuServe shares still owned by H&R Block will not come onto the market.
CompuServe added 93.75 cents to $13.25 on Nasdaq, while H&R Block fell $2.125 to $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. America Online added 75 cents to $31.625, also on Nasdaq.
In July, CompuServe shocked Wall Street with a warning that it expected a loss for its first quarter ended July 31, its first as a publicly traded company.
The company blamed the high costs of introducing its new Wow! consumer online service and investing in an overhaul of its network infrastructure, as well as a decline in overall subscriber growth as cancellations outpaced new customers.
In response, CompuServe and H&R Block were slapped with a shareholder lawsuit alleging they had misrepresented the online service's prospects in the prospectus for the stock offering.
When the company last week reported a first-quarter loss of $29.6 million, or 32 cents a share, it also warned investors that losses would continue for the second quarter ending in October.
H&R Block, which is also the nation's largest consumer tax filing service, is likely to wait for the online industry to settle down before completing the spin-off, analysts said.
In addition to the losses, H&R Block cited the planned introduction next month of new technology for CompuServe and its new Wow! service.
Meanwhile, America Online has had problems of its own, including price cuts to stay competitive with Internet access providers and an embarrassing 19-hour service blackout earlier this month. But analysts said that in contrast to CompuServe, America Online has continued to grow, though at a slower pace.
""The problems CompuServe is having are likely to benefit America Online in the next nine months,"" one analyst said.",0
"Iomega Corp. said Thursday it plans to apply its computer storage technology to handheld consumer electronics in a way that could lower the cost of saving and transfering data to such devices.
The reusable data storage system, to be known as ""n-hand,"" could be used in digital cameras, computer game devices, cellular phones and handheld personal computers known as digital assistants.
In cameras, for example, the technology could function as a removable ""digital film"" that would replace existing chemical photographic film.
""Our n-hand technology ... has the potential to change the way consumers use portable electronic devices,"" said Kim Edwards, president and chief executive of the Roy, Utah-based company, in a statement.
""We are bringing personal computer-like storage to portable devices,"" added George Meyer, Iomega's director of marketing for new business, in a telephone interview.
The n-hand disks are expected to be priced at less than $10 for a 20-megabyte disk, and could be available by the second half of 1997. Iomega said the n-hand disks are about half the size of a business card.
Several industry analysts said they believe Iomega's technology could help propel digital cameras into the consumer mainstream within a matter of years, by freeing users from the fixed capacity of existing flash memory storage and by substantially reducing the overall cost of such cameras.
A digital camera could store from 50 to 80 images on a single $10 n-hand disk, Iomega said, depending on image resolution. Consumers now pay hundreds of dollars for a flash memory card capable of holding the same number of images, it noted.
Jim Porter, a data storage analyst with market research firm Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., said the Iomega technology could cut the cost of storing photographs by a factor of 20 times.
A Kodak digital camera costing $499 currently could be priced as low as $300 within a matter of years, he said, reflecting the elimination of more costly digital storage methods.
Iomega's plans pose a theat to makers of flash memory chips that are used to store digital information in such small electronic devices currently. Leading makers including Sandisk Corp., Intel Corp. and Toshiba Corp.
In addition, the Iomega system could help accelerate the current digital transformation of the camera industry, leading to a decline in revenues that cameramakers receive from conventional silver halide-based photo film and equipment.
""With 'n-hand' you have a digital camera that you can treat like a regular camera,"" Meyer said, referring to the replaceable nature of the Iomega high-density floppy disk system.
""This technology can make digital cameras much more competitive with regular ones,"" he said.
Besides lacking a low-cost removable storage medium, digital cameras offer inferior picture quality but image resolution is improving rapidly, analysts said. This could lead to explosive growth of the new cameras in coming years.
Shares of the company closed up $1.375 to $25.375 on active trading on Nasdaq. On Friday, Iomega's stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Intel Corp stock surged on Tuesday, lifted by a quarterly earnings report that substantially outpaced Wall Street expectations and confirmed its status among analysts as the shooting star of technology stocks.
The earnings report released Monday spurred gains in the stocks of personal computer makers who build machines based on Intel microprocessors but it did little to buoy other chip makers.
""The Intel report was clearly a positive for the whole PC industry,"" said veteran semiconductor analyst Dan Klesken of Robertson Stephens & Co.
""It is an endorsement of our view that we are in for a strong upgrade cycle for the second half of the year,"" said Klesken.
Still, analysts said Intel stock gains were restrained by uncertainties over whether the third quarter's sharp rise in orders may have come at the expense of the fourth quarter.
The concern was magnified by Intel's decision to at least temporarily halt the practice of forecasting its business prospects.
Intel stock rose $3.50 to $111.125 Tuesday on Nasdaq in a volatile day of trading in which just under 20 million Intel shares changed hands. Intel's gains sparked the technology-heavy Nasdaq index to 1,258.10, up 1.74, its second consecutive record closing high.
On Monday Intel reported third-quarter profits of $1.3 billion, up from $931 million in 1995's third quarter. Wall Street had predicted profits of $1.1 billion.
Brokers responded to the results with a wave of higher earnings projections for Intel for 1996 and 1997.
Personal computer makers who rely on Intel micrprocessors also saw significant gains, as investors viewed Intel's order surge as confirmation of strong demand for the machines themselves.
Compaq Computer Corp. gained $2 to close at $74.75 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a day ahead of its own earnings report, due Wednesday.
Dell Computer Corp. rose $3.50 to $88.375 and Gateway 2000 Inc. climbed $3.375 to $56.75, both on Nasdaq.
But Intel's swelling fortunes were seen as having only limited effect on other semiconductor suppliers.
Montgomery Securities analyst Clark Westmont said the main beneficiaries were a handful of custom PC chip makers who sell graphics controllers and other PC-related devices.
Every Intel processor that goes into a PC is accompanied by serveral such ancillary chips.
""Intel is the locomotive who drags along all the other guys in this food chain,"" Westmont said. ""As a result, these other guys are enjoying higher recognition today.""
He pointed in particular to PC graphics component supplier Chips and Technologies Inc. stock, which jumped $4.875 to $19.75, or roughly 25 percent, after it released its own strong quarterly earnings report.",0
"The stock of General Electric Co. rose in active trading Tuesday, boosted by speculation it might raise its dividend and increase its share buyback programme following upbeat comments by Chairman John Welch.
Salomon Brothers analyst Russell Leavitt said Welch told analysts who attended a private meeting with him on Monday that he ""expected earnings to be up about 13 percent this year, in line with expectations.""
According to First Call, which monitors Wall Street analysts' earnings projections, GE's profits for the 1996 calendar year are expected to equal $4.40 per share.
In 1995, GE earned profits of $3.90 per share, or $6.6 billion, on revenues of $43 billion.
Analysts said news from the meeting helped propel General Electric's stock onto the NYSE most actives list. The stock was up $2.25 to $97.50 in late afternoon trading after earlier climbing as much as $3.25.
A GE spokesman declined to comment on Welch's remarks to analysts. He said the company had gone on record in its third-quarter earnings report, released Oct. 10, as being on track for a ""record year"" in 1996.
The spokesman confirmed, however, that GE's board would meet on Friday.
After the meeting, CS First Boston said analyst Martin Sankey reiterated his strong buy recommendation on GE's stock and boosted his 1997 earnings estimate 5 cents to $5 per share.
""They are looking for good progress next year,"" Leavitt said, adding that while little new was disclosed at the twice-yearly briefing, ""There seems to be a high level of conviction that progress is in place.""
Welch specifically cited a turnaround in the company's power businesses and strong growth in its NBC broadcasting unit, Leavitt said.
""You've got everything pretty much clicking in the company,"" said NatWest Securites analyst Nicholas Heyman, who also attended the meeting. He said Welch spoke of 13 percent earnings growth for both the current year and for 1997.
More good news could come as early as Friday, when GE's board of directors is scheduled to meet.
At that meeting, several analysts said they believed the board will authorise a two-for-one split of GE shares and increase its authorisation to buy back the company's shares to $13 billion from its current level of $9 billion.
Company share buybacks increase the value of remaining shares by decreasing the number of shares outstanding, a move looked on with favour by investors, since the underlying value of each share held increases.
In addition, NatWest's Heyman said he expected the board to boost the stock's annual dividend by 13 percent to $2.08 from its current level of $1.84 per share.
Since early 1995, General Electric's stock has proven one of Wall Street's best perfomers, more than doubling in value.
""Most of the Wall Street analysts came away comfortable that the earnings estimates will be realised this year and next year,"" one fund manager said of the meeting with Welch. ""It's his usual magic with Wall Street.""",0
"Small capitalization technology stocks shrugged off a wave of profit-taking that socked blue chip stocks Monday as investors shopped for values among beaten- down or lesser known names, especially in the Internet sector.
""Some of the second- and third-tier technology names have become the focus,"" agreed Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.  
Among the beneficiaries of this broadening interest in technology stocks were America Online Inc, up 4-1/8 to 39-1/2 and Adobe Systems Inc, up 2-1/4 to 41-3/4.
Informix Corp was the most actively traded issue on the Nasdaq, gaining 1-1/4 to 25 by mid-afternoon Monday, following reports that its next-generation Universal Server database has the edge over rival Oracle Corp.
Other strong gainers included Netscape Communications Corp, which rose 2-1/8 to 58 and electronic payment company CyberCash Inc, which gained 2-7/8 to 28-1/8.  
""We are stepping down the liquidity and quality ladder,"" said Paul Rabbit, Oppenheimer's chief portfolio strategist. ""(Investors) are trying to find some of the beat up ones,"" he said, adding, ""There is a search for less exploited areas.""
""Today is the first (trading) day of a new month and there appears to be a little profit taking here, but it doesn't appear to be affecting the technology stocks,"" Bleier said.
Analysts said investors were shying from bellwethers Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp following their strong run-up in November, even as International Business Machines Corp hit a new year-high.  
Intel was down 1-1/8 to 125-3/4 on volume of nearly five million shares, while Microsoft shed 1-1/4 to 155-5/8. Both stocks remain near historic price levels. The Dow Jones composite index was off 41.74 to 6479.96.",0
"Acknowledging its failure to attract U.S. consumers, CompuServe Corp said it would disband its family-oriented Wow! online service and plans to defend its business and technical customer base.
The world's second-largest online service also said it would accelerate the way it expenses customer marketing costs and that it was taking a $28.6 million charge in the latest quarter for previously incurred subscriber acquisition costs.
Instead, it said it would pursue higher margin businesses, including international consumer markets, such as Europe.  
""For CompuServe, this represents a strategic retreat back to its basics,"" said Peter Krasilovsky, a veteran analyst of the online industry at Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.
""CompuServe will never contend for the King's mantle among the online service/Internet service providers in North America again,"" he declared.
CompuServe stock fell 1-5/8, to 10-1/8, in early trading. H&R Block Inc, which several months ago suspended plans to spin off its remaining 80 percent stake in CompuServe to shareholders, fell 1-1/2, to 26-7/8.  
Earlier today, H&R had reported a substantial loss for its quarter ended October 31, citing CompuServe's turmoil, and said it planned to go ahead with a cut in its quarterly dividend payment to $0.20 per share from $0.32 previously.
In its own report, CompuServe said it lost $0.63 per share for the second quarter ended in October, after charges for exiting the Wow! business and other accounting changes. This compared to a $0.19 a share profit in the year-ago quarter.
Disbanding Wow! resulted in an after-tax charge of $4.9 million, or $0.06 a share, and amortization of prior marketing costs led to the charge of $28.6 million, or $0.31 a share.  
""CompuServe's core users have always appreciated that service most for its independent forums and bulletin boards. They don't have any other place in cyberspace to get those services,"" Krasilovsky said.
CompuServe officials stressed that no new layoffs would result from the latest moves. Wow!'s 35 employees have already been absorbed into CompuServe Interactive, they said. The company's total headcount stands at about 3,200 worldwide.
In a telephone interview, CompuServe spokesman Steve Conway maintained that while his company was abandoning further mass marketing efforts aimed at U.S. consumers, ""If you are currently a subscriber, you will not notice a change.""  
Nontheless, the Columbus, Ohio-based company said it would focus its efforts and investments going forward on business and professional markets, its traditional selling point.
Besides defending its core online services customer base, they said CompuServe will focus on other profitable operations like its network systems infrastructure unit, which generates 30 percent of total revenues.
In disbanding its Wow! service, the company blamed new market entrants, or Internet service providers, pricing competition and the high costs of consumer marketing.
The company announced plans to launch early next year a new ""CompuServe for Business"" serivce, an enhanced version of its core CompuServe Interactive with a new software interface and added content from ""thousands"" of information providers.  
Despite a series of missteps in the United States, growth remains robust overseas, where CompuServe's brand is the best recognized name among online and Internet access providers.
Conway said CompuServe Interactive's service has nearly doubled in its number of subscribers in Europe during the past 12 months, rising to more than 800,000 from about 450,000. ""It's a growing market for these services, and we outpaced the market,"" he said.
About 60 percent of CompuServe's European customers are for business, professional and technical users, while 40 percent fall in the consumer category, Conway said.
That's roughly the inverse of North America, where about 55 percent of CompuServe's main service are consumers.
The 800,000 customers represent the bulk of CompuServe's international base, which totaled 1.12 million at October 31.
The Wow! service had been introduced only seven months ago to much fanfare, but failed to get off the ground.
CompuServe Vice President Scott Kaufman, the man in charge of developing the Wow! service, promised at the time Wow! was lauched to carpet bomb consumers with free software disks promoting the new service.
""They'll be falling out of cereal boxes,"" he had vowed at the time.",0
"Texas Instruments Inc. said Tuesday it set a licensing pact with Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. of Korea that will generate royalty payments of more than $1 billion over 10 years.
In exchange, each side agreed to drop pending patent infringement lawsuits against each other.
The agreement replaces a previous five-year deal that expired at the end of 1995, the Dallas-based maker of computer chips, notebook computers and other electronics products said.
While the deal reassured some Wall Street analysts who were not already counting on additional earnings from the settlement, others noted the terms appeared to be far less generous than one with Samsung in 1995.
""Texas Instruments appears willing to take a lower number to get the suits dropped against them,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlak said.
""Our assessment is that the agreement is at roughly 40 to 50 percent of the rate of the old agreement,"" Kurlak said of the royalty formula Samsung will use to pay Texas Instruments.
The new license, which runs until the end of 2005, covers a broad base of patents from both companies, including those for semiconductors, personal computers, consumer products and telecommunications equipment, Texas Instruments said.
""We are pleased with this agreement and the value it places on our patented technology,"" said Richard Agnich, a senior vice president and general counsel at Dallas-based Texas Instruments.
The company in 1985 started to more aggressively defend alleged unauthorised use of its technology in a bid to improve the value of its intellectual property within the semiconductor industry. In the intervening decade, the company has won billions of dollars in additional royalties, a spokesman said.
Texas Instruments said it expected Samsung to pay it about $105 million in the fourth quarter for ""catch-up royalties"" covering the first nine months of 1996 when the companies were battling in court.
Analysts said the ""catch up"" payments should substantially boost earnings for the quarter ending in December, but the gain will be offset by a charge for an undisclosed amount the company plans to take for an early retirmement programme.
Kurlak estimated Texas Instruments will see $35 million in additional quarterly royalties going forward as a result of the Samsung deal, but that is down from the roughly $85 million it received quarterly from Samsung at the end of 1995.
With this deal, Texas Instruments said it has almost completed its 1995 round of patent cross-license agreements with major semiconductor makers.
Earlier in the year, Texas Instruments reached 10-year deals with Fujitsu Ltd., Oki Electric Industry Co. Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.
It said talks continue with NEC Corp. and several smaller producers.
The royalty payments will bolster Texas Instruments's net income, and allow it to focus on more profitable lines of business, analysts said.
Texas Instrument stock jumped $4.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Computer distribution powerhouse Ingram Micro Inc. is set to hold its widely anticipated initial public offering on Wall Street Thursday despite some last-minute delays, including management changes.
""We haven't seen anything comparable in the technology sector with its kind of name this year,"" said Manish Shah, editor and publisher of the IPO Maven, of the new issue.
Anticipating heavy demand, the estimated price on Ingram's 20 million share offering was boosted to $17 to $19 a share Wednesday from $14 to $16, said underwriter Morgan Stanley.
As the world's leading distributor of computer hardware, software and networking equipment to corporate resellers and computer retailers, Santa Ana, Calif.-based Ingram is a veritable steam-engine of computer industry growth.
There are really only three world-class distributors of computer products: Ingram, with revenues expected to hit roughly $10 billion this year, Merisel Inc. with $6 billion and Tech Data Corp. at $4 billion.
That size advantage is crucial said Seymour Merrin, a leading industry analyst, who heads Merrin Information Services Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif. ""Market share isn't just an important factor,"" Merrin said. ""It's the only factor.""
Ingram's suppliers read like a Who's Who of the leading computer brands -- names like IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Novell and U.S. Robotics. And like many of those names, Ingram is seen as the undisputed leader in its own industry.
Its main customers are not end-users of technology products, but the middlemen of distribution -- corporate resellers, systems intergrators and computer retailers.
""Ingram's got it all: distribution power, brand quality and customer or franchise loyalty,"" Shah said.
Underlying excitement about the new stock is a belief that Ingram is positioned to benefit directly from a multi-year computer buying boom expected to take hold later this year or early in 1997 and last for anywhere from two to four years.
Companies are preparing to upgrade to faster Intel Pentium PCs running Microsoft Windows NT and buy a host of related products made passible by the more powerful machines.
""We are coming close to the proverbial elbow of the hockey stick,"" said Merrin, referring to the hook upwards on sales charts that signifies explosive growth.
In one important respect, however, Ingram should not be classified with other top technology names famous for their explosive earnings growth and spiraling stock prices.
Ingram competes in a brutal low-margin business that has more in common with supermarkets or trucking than computers -- its profit margins have in fact declined to 6.8 percent in the first half of 1996 from 8.1 percent in 1993.
The company's path to Wall Street has not been without its detours and mishaps.
An anticipated public offering was temporarily derailed earlier in the year when Linwood ""Chip"" Lacy -- the engineer credited with driving Ingram Micro's growth over the years -- resigned as chairman and chief executive.
Ingram located a prominent replacement in Jerre Stead, the former head of mainframe software maker Legent Corp. until its 1995 acqusition by Computer Associates International Inc. It named Michael Grainger chief finacial officer two weeks ago.
But any Ingram doubters will remain on the sidelines Thursday.
""It is definitely one of the best offerings of the year. There is great demand,"" said Shah for shares of the stock. ""I think it will remain strong and by the end of year, it could be a $30 stock,"" he added.",0
"AT&T Corp's decision to name outsider John Walter as heir to Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Allen boils down to a basic gamble the company believes it must take to prepare for the torrent of competition ahead.
The nation's largest phone company rejected the standard telecoms pedigree shared by most top executives in the industry -- including Allen -- in favor of a more general set of business leadership skills Walter has demonstrated.  
Wednesday, AT&T said Walter, until recently the chief executive of commercial printer R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co, would replace Allen as CEO and chairman in 18 months.
""The magnitude of the challenge has got to be at least of the same magnitude as the one that IBM faced,"" said Robert Miles, a top corporate turnaround consultant and author of a forthcoming book of case studies called, ""Corporate Comeback.""
But analysts who followed his tenure at Donnelley credited Walter with being a tough-minded visionary who successfully guided the expansion of his commercial publishing firm into a computer-savvy marketing services firm.  
""Walter understands how to run a business and make money,"" said Frank Dzubeck, president of Communcations Network Architects, a Washington, D.C.-based technology consulting firm.
At Donnelley, he closed businesses which could not carry their own weight. Earlier this year Donnelley spun off direct mailer Metromail Corp and is planning the spinoff of Donnelley Enterprise Solutions Inc, a provider of information management services to large law firms and investment bank.
This crucible of experience will come in handy for Walter at AT&T as the giant company undergoes a similarly wrenching business and technology transition, but on a massive scale.  
Walter is certainly not without his critics on Wall Street. Financial analysts must be convinced he can scale his Donnelley lessons upward to address $80 billion-a-year AT&T. Donnelley had 1995 revenues of $6.5 billion.
Wednesday, SBC Warburg analyst Barry Sine cut his rating on AT&T to hold from buy, citing disappointment about the naming of Walter to lead the company. ""In our view what was needed was a fresh face with a high-tech resume,"" he said.
Donnelley's growth came at a price, other analysts added, noting how despite Walter's visionary style the publisher struggled with falling earnings and restructuring issues.  
""A lot of things have been going wrong,"" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price. The stock price has performed listlessly recently, trading near its 52-week lows. The stock Thursday was at 38-1/8, up 1/4.
Still, several analysts classified Walter among the new breed of top technology managers who earn their stripes as sophisticated consumers of technology but who know how to delegate decisions about the nuts and bolts of technology.  
Perhaps the most famous example of this type is an executive like Louis Gerstner, who joined IBM Corp in 1993 from consumer products distributor RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp and was with American Express Co prior to that.
""Maybe you don't actually have to have a guy who has time to get his hands dirty,"" Dzubeck said.
""I think the operating issues, the strategic issues become paramount,"" he said, while technology strategy can best be left to second and third-tier managers.
Other outsiders who have become the top-guns at successful technology companies include Jim Barksdale of Netscape Communications Corp, the former chief information officer of air freight forwarder Federal Express Corp.
Another example would be Alex Mandl, the man Walter has initially been hired to replace as second-in-command at AT&T, following Mandl's departure in August to join a wireless communications venture of Associated Group Inc.
Before joining AT&T in 1991, Mandl headed SeaLand Services.
""He's transformed a large, old-line company challenged by new technologies and changing markets into a tough global competitor,"" said Allen in a statement. ""Meeting those challenges is what leading the 'new' AT&T is all about.""",0
"Shiva Corp stock rose five points Wednesday amid resurgent speculation that it may be an acquisition target of a major network equipment player.
    ""It sure looks like people are speculating that its going to be taking over,"" said Robertson Stephens analyst Paul Johnson, who maintains a long-term attractive on the stock.
    Shiva shares have risen nearly 14 percent in the last two days. By early afternoon Wendesday, the stock was trading at 53-3/4, up 5 points on the day.
    Shiva declined comment on what it called ""a market rumor.""
 ""We have had rumors like this before,"" said Cynthia Deysher, Shiva's chief financial officer. ""Our firm policy on this is not to comment on market rumors,"" she said.
    Several analysts said signs of merger speculation were apparent in the stock's recent gains.
    Cowen & Co analyst Chris Stix noted that Shiva was mentioned in a trade magazine gossip column published Monday as among potential merger candidates in the network industry.
    The article, published in the November 11 issue of Communications Week, spoke of a possible tie-up between rival Ascend Communications Inc and Shiva, among others.
    Stix said another factor behind the rebound in recent weeks of Shiva's share price may be the company's comments in public forums that it has a potential major contract win with a major telecom carrier it has declined to name.
    The Cowen analyst maintains a strong buy on Shiva.
    The stock hit a low of 38 in late September, following a steep three-month decline from its historic high of 87 reached in June, when it was a favorite among momentum investors.
    Although enthusiastic about Shiva's business fundamentals, Johnson discounted any recent product announcements as the cause behind the recent share price moves.
   ""This doesn't appear to me that its product-related. It's too violent,"" he said. ""It's not valuation-related either.""
    Analysts consider Shiva one of two pure plays in the explosively growing market for remote access
telecommunications equipment. The other is high-flying Ascend, the dominant player in the market.
    Johnson said Shiva might also prove attractive to any of the large data networking companies seeking to gain quick market share in the remote access business.
    ""With a company in Shiva's position, I can't think of a company that wouldn't be interested,"" he said.
 Johnson said that Shiva, which by his estimates has 13 percent of the remote access market, may prove attractive to any of the major network industry leaders -- Cisco Systems Inc, 3Com Corp or Bay Networks Inc.
    He left off Cabletron Systems Inc from the list of potential buyers, noting that Cabletron had acquired Network Express Inc in May to beef up its remote access line.
    Shiva has carved out a strategic niche in the market for remote acccess products, which are used by companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications carriers to handle data communications over far-flung wide-area networks.
    Shiva is the No. 3 supplier in remote acccess, behind Ascend, which  holds 40 percent of the market, and U.S. Robotics, a more diversified company with a 31 percent share, according to Johonson's estimates.
    Stix said Shiva, in partnership with Northern Telecom Ltd, has the lead in a new type of network switching product that allows telephone carriers to address the growing overload of their voice networks by Internet data traffic.",0
"Elementary school students with access to the Internet learned more than kids who lacked access, an indepedent research group concluded after conducting a comparative study in seven urban school districts.

"Internet access providers and others who met with Net-savvy lawmakers said they fear Congress will wreak havoc on cyberspace but are also heartened by the growing number of legislators who understand the global computer network.
Company representatives met Tuesday night at the Capitol with members of the Congressional Internet Caucus, about 85 legislators with a common interest in the Net, to express their hopes and fears about efforts to make laws governing cyberspace.
""I think it's inevitable that there will be bills introduced that attempt to legislate the content of everything on the Internet,"" Tom Evslin, vice president of AT&T Corp.'s WorldNet Internet service, said after the meeting.
Evslin said it would be as difficult to keep Congress from making wrong moves as it would be to get the legislature to act to head off problems.
Bill Schrader, president of Internet provider PSINet Inc., was more blunt. ""Be very careful or you will destroy this industry,"" he warned.
The members of Congress who attended the meeting pledged to try to protect the Internet.
""We have a lot of pretty tough work ahead of us,"" Representative Rick White, R-Pa., and a co-chairman of the caucus conceded. ""We have many, many issues coming down the pike from encryption to privacy, to copyright and taxation.""
Encryption is the use of software to encode and decode information.
On Wednesday, White co-sponsored one of the first Internet-related bills in the 105th Congress. The bill, authored by Virginia Republican Rep Bob Goodlatte, would relax export restrictions on computer hardware and software containing encryption features.
Sen. Conrad Burns, also a co-chairman, warned that, despite the caucus, legislation will always trail developments in the private sector.
""The government making policy is never ahead of the curve,"" the Montana Republican said. ""If we do the right thing now, I guarantee you that by the time it's passed and the president signs it, we'll be behind the curve.""
Last year was a mixed bag for the Internet in Congress.
Legislators passed the Communications Decency Act, opposed by online companies and civil libertarians as an infringement on free speech rights, but also defeated measures that would have imposed liability on Internet providers for copyright infringement.
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s chief scientist, John Gage, fretted that, with only 85 pro-Internet legislators out of 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate, most in Congress remained ignorant of the Net. ""We've got a long way to go,"" he said.
Companies interested in the Internet offered some conflicting goals for Congress. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, urged the legislators to impose new laws protecting Hollywood products.
""Congress cannot avoid that all intellectual property has to be protected -- this can't be Dodge City without a sheriff,"" Valenti said. But he also praised the Internet as ""the most valuable and spacious information greenhouse that's ever been built.""
PSINet's Schrader countered that existing laws already protected movies, books and other works. ""Everything is not new,"" he said. ""It's the same-old, same-old.""",0

"The Internet continued to grow in leaps and bounds this year while online services found it much harder to add new customers, a new survey says.
An estimated 35 million adults in the United States had used the Internet, according to the poll by Louis Harris and Associates conducted in late September, up from 27 million at the beginning of the year.
""Although the number of people who use computers has fluctuated around just over half of the adult population, the number of adult Americans using computers for cyber-activities is growing,"" said Humphrey Taylor, chairman of the polling organisation.
While online services like America Online Inc. and Compuserve Corp. could lay claim to almost 41 million subscribers, that was the same level Harris found back in January.
Online services, which provide private online content in addition to Internet access, have faced greater competition this year from companies like AT&T Corp., which provide cheaper Internet-only access.
Businesses, which are looking to the Internet as a potential source of new revenue, are intensely interested in figures on its usage. Differing surveys have come up with widely varying numbers.
The Harris poll found that, although more people are getting wired, they are on average spending less time in cyberspace.
Home users said they were online 2.8 hours a week, down from three hours a week in an April survey. Business and other users said they were online for 1.8 hours, down from two hours in April.
The poll also reinforced findings of earlier studies showing that more educated people were more likely to use computers and access the Internet.
People with college and graduate degrees were twice as likely to use computers and four times more likely to access the Internet as people who only graduated from high school, the poll found.
The poll's results were based on a telephone survey of 1,032 adults at the end of September and have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, according to Harris.",0
"The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the nation's primary regulators of derivatives, has no authority over most foreign currency transactions, the Supreme Court said Tuesday.
In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that a 1974 law exempting some transactions in foreign currency from CFTC oversight also exempted some foreign exchange derivatives, financial instruments whose value is based on the value of currencies like the dollar or Japanese yen.
The CFTC regulates trading of derivatives such as futures and options on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity. By law, such trading must occur on a recogized exchange, such as the Chicago Board of Trade or the New York Mercantile Exchange.
But when Congress created the commission in 1974, it added an amendment permitting off-exchange trading in foreign currency and a few other items without CFTC regulation. The amendment was requested by the Treasury Department, which believed that the developing market in foreign currency among large banks and securities firms would be overregulated by CFTC oversight.
The CFTC stayed away from the inter-bank foreign exchange market, which has grown to $40 billion a day in total trading. The commission did, however, prosecute small-scale fraudulent foreign exchange investment peddlers, often called ""bucket shops.""
But when the CFTC pursued William Dunn, whose $180 million foreign currency fund lost $95 million in 1993, Dunn argued that the 1974 Treasury amendment should also apply to his trading of foreign exchange options.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court agreed with the bulk of Dunn's argument.
""We think it plain that foreign currency options are 'transactions in foreign currency' within the plain meaning of the statute,"" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote. ""We are not persuaded by any of the arguments advanced by the CFTC in support of a narrower reading.""
That pleased banks and Wall Street trade groups, which had sided with Dunn. They argued that subjecting their off-exchange foreign exchange trading to CFTC oversight would be too costly, forcing them to shut down U.S. operations and move overseas.
""We're obviously delighted at the result,"" said Ken Raisler, an attorney for several of the trade groups.
""It supports our view that the amendment should be read broadly,"" Raisler, a former general counsel of the CFTC added.
Dunn's lawyer and the banks suggested that any wrongdoing in the foreign exchange area could be dealt with under existing law by other federal agencies, but the Supreme Court did not address the issue. Most off-exchange derivatives trading is not directly regulated, although most participants in such markets are overseen by bank, securities and insurance regulators.
The CFTC still has jurisdiction over foreign currency derivatives traded on an exchange, which include futures contracts. But that market is dwarfed by the over-the-counter market among banks and similiar institutions.
In a lower court case last year, the CFTC argued unsuccessfully that a fraudulent ""bucket shop"" constituted an exchange.
On Tuesday, the commission maintained that the Supreme Court had decided only the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment covered options trading.
""While we are disappointed in the outcome of the case, we note that the Supreme Court's opinion was limited to the narrow issue of whether the Treasury amendment treats futures and options the same,"" CFTC general counsel Dan Waldman said. ""The court's decision does not affect the commission's ongoing efforts to police fraud against the public in foreign currency trading.""
Congress is already discussing amending the 1974 Treasury amendment. The Supreme Court's decision ""underlines the need for Congress to make decisions about what financial products should or should not be subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction,"" said Andy Fisher, spokesman for the Senate Agriculture Committee.
Sens. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., Pat Leahy, D-Vt., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, introduced a Senate bill to overhaul futures regulation. ""It makes the case to proceed with that bill as quickly as we can,"" Fisher said.
The court invited congressional action. Recognising an ""important public policy dispute"" underlying the case, the court suggested ""these arguments are addressed to the Congress, not the courts.""",0
"Supreme Court justices Wednesday sharply questioned rules governing so-called derivative investments and foreign currency trading in a case that could have wide repercussions for both markets.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has traditionally prosecuted crooks who ripped off the public with fraudulent investments. But sophisticated investors such as big banks have been allowed to trade similiar financial instruments with little direct regulation, market participants said.
That distinction has been blurred in recent years, as defendants accused of fraud by the CFTC have sought to rely on an exemption from regulation, relied on by the bigger players, in a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act.
The amendment was added at the request of the Treasury Department to ensure that sophisticated investors trading in foreign currency and a few other markets would not be subject to uneccessary regulation by the CFTC.
Lower courts have made conflicting rulings about the 1974 amendment and the Supreme Court decided last year to hear the case of William Dunn, a foreign currency investment advisor charged with fraud by the CFTC after losing $95 million of his clients' money.
Jeffrey Minear, assistant to the Solicitor General -- the federal government's representative before the Supreme Court -- defended the CFTC's prosecution of Dunn before the court Wednesday. Minear argued that the 1974 exemption for ""transactions in foreign currency"" did not cover Dunn's trading in foreign currency options, one type of derivative. A derivative is an investment whose value is derived from a stock, bond, currency, commodity or other instrument.
But justices questioned Minear's distinction, which relied heavily on the particular meaning of the word ""in.""
Congress was ""not using consistent language"" in the commodity laws passed in 1974 and since then, Justice Antonin Scalia said. ""They use in, they use on, they use involving.""
Minear drew a sharp rebuke from Chief Justice William Rehnquist when he later argued that Congress expressed greater concern about fraudulent use of options than other types of investments under a 1922 commodity trading law.
""Perhaps it was true in 1922 but that doesn't prove it's true now,"" the chief justice interjected.
Gary Stumpp, Dunn's lawyer, argued that other federal agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission might have jurisdiction over fraudulent foreign exchange trading but not the CFTC.
Several Wall Street trade groups and big banks filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Dunn's position. They warned that if the court upheld the CFTC's position, the burden of additional regulation might drive the gigantic $40 billion a day foreign exchange market in the United States might overseas.
On the other side, Chicago futures exchanges said they could be put out of business by unregulated competitors if the court throws out the CFTC's case against Dunn.
Brooksley Born, chairwoman of the CFTC, attended the argument but declined to comment afterwards.
A decision is not expected for at least a few months. Several members of Congress have said they may introduce legislation early next year to change the 1974 amendment, possibly rendering the verdict in the Dunn case moot.",0
"An influential global research group is preparing guidelines on encryption policy for its member countries but will duck some of the most contentious issues involved, according to a draft of the report obtained by Reuters.
The Clinton administration, seeking to rally support at home and abroad for its controversial encryption export policy, got some discussion of its approach in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines but not an endorsement.  
On perhaps the most difficult issue, the draft guidelines do not favor or oppose a requirement in the U.S. policy that data-scrambling encryption programs provide a means for law enforcement officials to obtain keys to crack the codes when necessary.
After indicating that governments should carefully weigh the costs and benefits of imposing so-called key recovery, the draft states ""this principle should not be interpreted as implying that governments should, or should not, initiate legislation that would allow lawful access.""  
On all the controversial areas in the draft, ""the member countries of the OECD have strongly held views but they don't always coincide,"" said John Dryden, head of the group's Information, Computer and Communications Policy division, in a telephone interview from Paris.
Some countries see widespread use of encryption as a means to protect the privacy of computer users and businesses, thereby encouraging global commerce, Dryden observed.
But others see encryption as possibly thwarting law enforcement's efforts to catch criminals and global terrorists, he said.  
The guidelines suggest that encryption users should have ""access to cryptography that meets their needs.""  Government controls should be ""no more than are essential to the discharge of government responsibilities.""
Instead of reconciling the different views, the draft guidelines lay out competing interests and possible approaches.
""It's not in itself a cryptography policy and it's not a attempt to draft a model national law that we're encouraging people to adopt,"" Dryden said.  
The guidelines also suggest encryption standards and usage should be ""determined by the market in an open and competitive environment.""
""There's a strong view that the private sector should have the possibility to use information networks to the best of their potential in order to create growth and jobs,"" Dryden said.
U.S. officials who have seen the preliminary draft praised its approach.  ""They're an important and helpful step forward,"" Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch said.  
""They're helpful because they put down on paper the proper foundation for getting into this,"" he added
Reinsch maintained that most countries will follow the U.S. lead and require so-called key recovery features for law enforcement.  Under the Clinton policy, domestic use of encryption is not regulated but the strongest coding products cannot be exported unless they include key recovery.
The draft guidelines, approved by a group of government and private sector experts at a meeting at the end of January, still must be approved by the top-level OECD council.  
The council is composed of ambassadors from the 29 member countries.
U.S. companies that have opposed the Clinton policy, contending it stifles their ability to compete with unfettered foreign firms, drew little solace from the OECD draft.
""This is not helpful,"" Netscape Communications Corp's public policy counsel Peter Harter said.  Netscape and other companies preferred stronger language endorsing free market policies, he said.",0
"Just days after a U.S. graduate student cracked the most powerful computer encryption system allowed out of the country, the Commerce Department announced it would allow three companies to export an even stronger system.
Until this year, computer encryption programmes, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" were classified as munitions and stronger programmes could not be exported.
But under a controversial new Clinton administration policy that took effect Jan. 1, companies may recieve permission to export stronger programmes.
""I'm happy that we've been able to do this within the first month without rancour or difficulty,"" Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration William Reinsch said in a telephone interview.
To export stronger programmes immediately, companies must agree to incorporate features within two years allowing the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the software keys.
The adminstration's policy has been widely criticised as not relaxing the export limits enough and some companies feared the requirement for a two-year plan would substantially delay export approvals.
The quick approvals should quell some of the criticism and encourage more applicants, Reinsch said.
""As a result of this, you will have more companies taking it seriously and we will expect more plans over the next couple of months,"" he said.
Encryption was once the realm of spies and generals. But with the explosion of online commerce on the Internet, encryption has become a vital tool for protecting everything from a business' e-mail message to a consumer's credit card number sent over the Net.
The amount of protection afforded by encryption is largely a function of the length of the software key measured in bits, the smallest unit of computer data.
Companies said products with just 40-bit long keys, the old limit, were too easy to crack. The approvals came just days after Ian Goldberg, a graduate student at the University of California, cracked a message encoded with a sofware key 40-bits long.
The government did not name the companies on Friday given permission to export stronger, 56-bit programmes, but Glenwood, Maryland-based Trusted Information Systems acknowledged that it was one of the three.
""Recent attacks on 40-bit encryption have shown that a global move to at least 56-bit (U.S. government standard) security must come soon,"" Trusted Information Executive Vice President Steven Lipner said.",0
"The growing business of doing business on the Internet poses a major challenge to tax collectors, but no special taxes should be imposed in cyberspace, the government said in report released Thursday.
""Treasury believes that these new technologies should not be used to justify new taxes,"" the Treasury Department draft report said. ""Accordingly, Treasury is not considering any type of value added tax, 'bit tax,' or other new excise tax on electronic commerce.""
Instead, the current system should evolve to tax income from all sources in a consistent manner, the department said.
""Our overall tax policy goal in this area should emulate policy in other areas -- maintain neutrality, fairness and simplicity -- a policy which serves to encourage all desirable economic activity new and old,"" the report said.
Businesses are already struggling with tax proposals from state and local governments, according to Kent Johnson, head of sales and transaction tax practice at KPMG Peat Marwick.
""State governments don't feel the same way as the federal government, but this report may be a good starting point for discussing all the issues,"" Johnson said.
This year, about $1 billion of goods and services will be sold online, growing to over $7 billion by the year 2000, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.
But the myriad tax laws and regulations affecting businesses may not keep pace with the fast-paced, often chaotic growth of the worldwide computer network.
Buyers and sellers on the Internet can be in different states or even different countries, complicating the task of collecting tax at the ""source"" of a transaction.
The department also said it was worried that tax evaders could use the anonymity provided by the Internet as a mask to avoid reporting income or to transfer money to offshore bank accounts.
But the report made no recommendations about how the government should deal with tax evasion issues. ""Treasury intends to study, and requests comments on these issues,"" the report said.
The report is available on the Treasury's web site, http://www.ustreas.gov.
The report on taxation is likely to be followed by reports on other aspects of online commerce that the department is studying, including consumer protection, electronic money, bank regulation and law enforcement, officials said.",0
"The Internet could provide a huge boost to the U.S. economy if the federal government pursues ""free market"" policies in cyberspace, a group of President Clinton's top advisers says in a draft report obtained by Reuters.
The group, an interagency task force headed by senior presidential adviser Ira Magaziner, recommended that the administration work globally to protect the Internet from new taxes, censorship and other onerous forms of regulation.
After seven months of deliberations, the task force is preparing to issue for public comment a report of principles and policies the Unites States should pursue, Magaziner said in an interview.
""One of the things we're trying to do with this paper is as much say what government should not do as say what they should do,"" Magaziner said. ""A lot of what industry is concerned about is that governments are already beginning to take actions around the world that would inhibit commerce.""
The growth of Internet commerce could help boost U.S. exports of everything from movies and news to software and consulting services. Exports of such products totalled $40 billion in 1995, the draft report noted.
The idea is to hitch U.S. exports to the speeding Internet commerce train. Sales of goods and services online are projected to grow to $7 billion in the year 2000, from about $1 billion this year, according to market researchers at Jupiter Communications.
""Companies have told us there would be a tremendous potential to increase world trade across the Internet if we could provide the right kind of environment,"" Magaziner said.
The draft report, called ""A Framework for Global Electronic Commerce,"" covers nine issues, from taxation and customs to privacy and security.
On taxation, the draft report echoes a report issued by the Treasury Department last month by stating no new taxes should be imposed. Acting through the World Trade Organisation, the United States should push for the Internet to be designated a duty-free zone, the draft said.
Some consumers worry that their privacy will be violated when they shop online. The report said governments should push vendors to disclose what will be done with information about consumers rather than dictate to merchants what they can or cannot do with the data.
On some issues, such as encryption -- encoding information in a scrambled format to provide a measure of security or privacy -- existing administration policies may be seen as conflicting with the free market approach of the draft report.
Magaziner said policies will evolve over time, ""but the paper will reflect where we are now.""
Magaziner headed Clinton's failed effort to reform the U.S. health care system, an initiative critics said favoured government over the private sector.
While disagreeing with his critics' characterisation of the health care plan, Magaziner said the Internet ""is a wholly different animal.
""I'm a problem solver, not an ideologue,"" he said.",0
"If the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System does as expected early Friday and votes to expand banks' non-banking activities, it will only heighten the drive in Congress to overhaul U.S. banking regulations completely, analysts and industry officials said.
The Fed is expected to vote to allow banks' section 20 subsidiaries to derive 25 percent of their revenue from non-banking activities such as securities underwriting, up from the current 10 percent ceiling.  
The section 20 proposal was released for comment in July, but since then another bank regulator has stolen some of the Fed's thunder. Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said his office will begin approving bank affiliates moving into an assortment of non-banking businesses.
Both the Fed's proposal and the Comptroller's actions will raise the pressure on Congress to scrap the Glass-Steagall Act, according to Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institute.  
In the past, banks led the charge to change the law because they wanted to get into other businesses, like selling insurance or underwriting stock deals. Insurance companies and securities firms generally opposed the banks creating legislative gridlock.
""Now the tables have been turned,"" Litan said. ""But it's not a two-way street. Other industries will want to level the playing field.""  
Both moves also reflect current market realities. The financial services industry, from banks to insurance companies to mutual funds, is converging. Mutual funds already offer checking account-like money market funds and some of the leading stock and bond underwriters are commercial banks.
In the words of one top regulator, the Fed's move from 10 to 25 percent, ""is not material."" The Fed has required banks to take certain steps to prevent problems in the subsidiaries from affecting the bank itself, and its government-insured deposits.
Competitors in other fields fret that the banks insured deposits are a form of government subsidy giving the banks an unfair advantage when they venture into other fields.
Comptroller Ludwig disagreed. Speaking to reporters after delivering a speech here Thursday, Ludwig said that walling off the subsidiary ""basically eliminates any subsidization.""
He opposes efforts by some in Congress to keep banks out of certain fields, such as real estate or merchant banking, entirely. ""It's a mistake to set product limits, particularly in this day and age when we have such a dynamic marketplace,"" he said.",0
"An influential Internet organisation has backed away from a proposal to dramatically expand the number of addresses available on the global computer network.
The Internet Society, which helps develop and coordinate Internet standards, announced this week that instead of moving ahead with the proposal it would form a nine-member committee to study the issue.
Unveiled in August, the proposal was an attempt to quell the growing number of disputes over desirable address names.
""There just seems to be no consensus at all,"" said Don Heath, president of the society. A variety of objections and questions have been raised about the August proposal, from technical networking issues to concerns about protection for trademarks and intellectual property.
""We thought we should try to pull it all together and have a good cross-section of people to discuss it and see if we can't reach a consensus,"" he said.
The new committee ought to finish its work by early next year and new names could be doled out four to six months later, Heath said. The committee could decide not to go forward with any address expansion, but Heath said that was an unlikely outcome.
""The facts of life are that people want descriptive names and vanity plates,"" Heath said.
Disputes over Internet names are occuring with increasing frequency as more companies seek to publicise and market their products over the Net.
For example, Viacom Inc.'s MTV cable music channel fought with one of its employees who had registered ""mtv.com,"" eventually regaining control of the name in an out-of-court settlement.
Every site on the World Wide Web must have a unique address name. Most addresses end with one of a few three letter designations, known as top-level domains, including ""com"" for private sites, ""gov for government sites and ""edu"" for sites run by schools.
In August, Internet Assigned Numbers Authority said it would oversee the creation of up to 150 new top level domains, easing the squeeze, especially for names in the private sector category.
The authority, operating under charter from the society and the Federal Network Council, is the central coordinator of Internet addresses and other standards.
The society's board of trustees voted in June to accept a preliminary version of the numbers authority proposal, with the proviso that the business aspects of proposal be fleshed out.
But with the ensuing controversy, the society decided a committee was needed to reexamine the proposal, Heath said. The committee will meet confer mostly by telephone and online, though an open forum is planned for mid-December in California.
The committee will include two members appointed by the society, two by the numbers authority and two by the Internet Architecure Board.
The International Telecommunication Union, the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the International Trademark Association will each appoint one member.",0
"The Supreme Court said Monday it would decide whether a federal regulator had properly allowed credit unions to expand their membership over the past 15 years, settling a long-running legal dispute between the cooperative non-profits and banks.
Credit unions praised the court's action to reconsider an Appellate court decision last July in favour of the banks. But bank representatives said the court was only delaying the inevitable.
The 1934 Federal Credit Union Act creating credit unions ""was not meant to delineate and protect bank markets at the expense of the consumer,"" said Marc Schaefer, president of AT&T Family Federal Credit Union, the credit union being sued by banks in the case.
""Consumers everywhere will be the winners when banks compete in the marketplace instead of the courts and on Capitol Hill,"" Schaeffer added.
American Bankers Association executive vice president Donald Ogilvie countered that ""the facts and law weigh overwhelmingly in our favour.""
""We are disappointed at the prospect of delay in the enfocement of a law we believe is quite clear,"" he said.
The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case in its upcoming term, which begins in October. A decision is likely early next year.
The case affects about 3,600 federal credit unions serving 32 million customers, Justice Department lawyer Walter Dellinger said.
The appeals court ruling in favour of the banks ""threatens nationwide instability and losses in the credit union industry affecting millions of persons,"" Dellinger said.
Until 1982, credit unions were limited to having members with a single common bond, such as people who worked for the same employer or lived in the same neighbourhood. Owned by their members, non-profit credit unions paid no federal taxes and were able to offer bank-like services often at lower prices than banks.
But in 1982, concerned about a lack of diversification, the National Credit Union Administration decided to allow credit unions to accept members from multiple distinct groups.
As many previously tiny credit unions diversified and grew substantially larger, banks complained of unfair competition. In 1990, they sued AT&T Family Federal, a North Carolina union that had grown to encompass over 150 different groups.
After the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the 1982 policy change last July, a lower court imposed strict membership limits on multi-group credit unions.
Those limits have since been put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision. But if the banks win, their next move could be to ask the courts to force multi-group credit unions to throw out members from all but one group.
Credit unions said they will ask Congress to amend the law if they lose in the Supreme Court.
""Congress never intended the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act to limit credit union growth or to protect banks from competition,"" said Daniel Mica, president of Credit Union National Association, a leading trade group. ""If the court does not see it this way, we think Congress will recognise consumers' need for credit unions.""",0
"The growing mass of Internet users have paid their fair share to local telephone companies and pose little threat to the phone system, according to a study released on Wednesday by a coalition of Internet and computer companies.
The coalition presented the report to counter studies by local phone companies released last year seeking to justify new access fees on Internet usage. The phone company studies found that Internet usage threatened to overwhelm the system.  
""The Internet is not crashing the telephone network,"" Information Technology Association of America President Harris Miller said at a news conference here.
""We are bringing the real facts to bear on a 'problem' that the phone companies have anecdotally created to protect their own interests,"" said Miller, whose group is a member of the Internet Access Coalition.
On December 24, the Federal Communications Commission said it had tentatively decided not to impose access fees on Internet providers similiar to those paid by long distance companies to local phone companies.  
But the commission also asked for comments about the effect of the Internet on the phone system.
""Our findings clearly show that claims of phone network 'congestion' resulting from Internet traffic and predictions of a 'meltdown' are greatly exaggerated,"" said Lee Selwyn, one of the study's authors.
Further, ordinary consumers using the Internet already pay the phone companies more than enough to cover the cost of increased use, said Selwyn, who is an expert on telecommunications regulation.  
The study found, for example, that in 1995 consumers paid more than $1.4 billion for installation and use of six million second phone lines devoted to accessing the Internet or other online services. The study said another eight million second lines were not primarily used for Internet access.
Local phone companies, some of which had not yet seen the new study, disputed Selwyn's conclusions.""To suggest that there is no real problem here is mind-boggling,"" Bell Atlantic spokesman Harry Mitchell said. As Internet companies add huge numbers of phone lines to meet growing demand, ""it does impact the capacity of the public telephone network.""  
America Online, for example, said recently it would double the number of modems it has to connect with subscribers from 200,000 to 400,000 by June.
But phone company studies considered only a few pieces of the phone system, focusing on switches between Internet service providers and the rest of the network, Selwyn said. While those few switches might be congested, capacity could be added inexpensively, he said.
The study also cited speeches by some phone company executives who have bragged about the additional revenues generated by increased Internet usage.  
""Sales of secondary lines at Bell Atlantic increased more than 50 percent, fueled by surging demand for Internet and telecommuting applications,"" company CEO Raymond Smith told Wall Street analysts last March. The revenue generated substantial profit because ""we were able to provision new lines and services from idle capacity in an existing plant.""
Company spokesman Mitchell said charges from second lines ""were not designed to subsidize Internet service providers.""
However, all sides agree that a technological solution could eliminate most congestion problems by separating calls carrying voice and data.
SBC Communications, parent of Southwestern Bell, announced last week it would introduce such splitting technology at a cost of less than $100 million.
""Technological solutions are readily available,"" Paul Misener, chairman of the Internet coalition's steering committee said.",0

"Legislators introduced two bills Thursday to overturn the Clinton administration's export limits on computer encryption technology, a key component of online commerce and global communications.
Encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software ""key,"" were once the realm of spies and generals.
But with the booming growth of the Internet, secret coding is now used for everything from keeping a business's e-mail confidential to protecting a consumer's credit card number if it is transmitted online.
Senators said export restrictions on encryption products were hindering the development of the Internet and making it impossible for U.S. companies to compete with foreign firms.
The bills ""roll back current restrictions on the export of strong cryptography so that high-tech U.S. firms are free to compete in the global marketplace and meet the demand of customers,"" Sen. Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and co-sponsor of both bills, said at a Capitol Hill news conference.
""Online commerce will never reach its full potential under the policies of this and past administrations,"" said Sen. Conrad Burns, a Montana Republican , also a co-sponsor.
The bills would generally allow a U.S. company to export a product with strong encryption features if similiar products were being offered for sale by a foreign supplier. Leahy and Burns introduced similiar measures in the last Congress.
Under the current Clinton administration policy, a company may export strong encryption only if the product also includes a feature to allow the U.S. government to crack the code by recovering the software ""key"" when acting under a court order or similiar authority. The administration says it must be able to crack the codes to catch international criminals and terrorists.
If the bills became law, mandatory key recovery would be banned but the government would still be permitted to restrict the export of encryption for military use or to countries posing terrorist threats.
The legislation would also write into law the current policy permitting unrestricted domestic use of encryption -- but one bill would criminalize the use of codes to obstruct justice.
The Clinton administration signalled its displeasure with the new bills.
""We continue to be disappointed with Senator Burns' approach because it does not balance the needs of individual privacy and economic growth with national security and public safety,"" Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch said. ""We believe there is a market for key recovery products from businesses who recognise the need for a back door to their own corporate data.""
Computer companies and privacy advocates hailed the bills.
""Both bills promote the freedom of this nation's fastest-growing industry to provide customers here and abroad with products they demand,"" said Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance. The group includes Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development and Apple Computer Inc., among others.
""This is the most important privacy legislation before the Congress today,"" said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Centre for Democracy and Technology.
Berman, who strongly opposes mandatory key recovery, said the policy ought to be ""my lock, my key.""",0
"The Federal Communications Commission has tentatively decided not impose fees on Internet service providers for use of local telephone lines, an official said Thursday.
On Tuesday, the commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking setting out two possible plans for reducing the $23 billion a year that long-distance telephone companies pay to local service providers in access fees.
""The commission raised the specific question of whether ISPs (Internet service providers) should pay access charges as we currently understand them,"" Kevin Werbach, counsel for new technology at the commission said. The FCC ""tentatively concluded that the answer is no.""
Local phone companies had pressed to have the access fee applied to Internet service companies. The phone companies argued that consumers using the Internet were getting a free ride and tying up local lines with lengthy calls.
Internet companies countered that such fees would smother the growth of the booming online industry.
""We think they did exactly the right thing,"" said Jill Lesser, deputy director of law and public policy at America Online, the largest online service in the world. ""It means the FCC is thinking in the right way about this. They're thinking for the growth of the Internet.""
The commission did issue a ""notice of inquiry"" asking for comments on the issues involved, Werbach said.
The arguments of both sides raise ""legitimate issues, so the commission initiated the notice of inquiry to develop a record on that,"" he said.
A notice of inquiry seeks comment but does not give the commission authority to then adopt a rule. The commission would have to first issue a notice of proposed rulemaking before applying access fees to Internet service providers, Werbach said.
The Internet notice is ""more foward looking"" than the proposed rules for long distance access fees, Werbach said. ""Once we have an idea what replaces the access charge system then we can take a look at that,"" he said.",0
"House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at remaking the regulatory landscape for banking and other financial services in the United States.
A similiar bill Leach introduced in the previous Congress foundered last June amid opposition from the insurance industry and House Democrats.  
Analysts have said this year's bill might have a better chance of passage, but that was before Leach decided to oppose Newt Gingrich's reelection as Speaker of the House, a move that could turn the leadership against his bill.
""This bill provides expanded powers for the banking, securities and insurance industries,"" Leach said in a statement. ""The ultimate beneficiaries of this legislation, however, are consumers.""  
""Not only will there be more products available to banking customers who are looking to maximize their savings, but efficiencies should lower industry costs and therefore costs to consumers,"" Leach said.
If passed, the bill would break down the legal barriers enacted after the Great Depression between banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
Bank regulators have already begun eroding the barriers for banks, putting pressure on Congress to level the playing field, analysts said.  
The Federal Reserve voted Dec 20 to allow bank subsidiaries to garner a greater share of revenue from underwriting activity. And a month earlier, the Comptroller of the Currency's office said it would allow banks to enter an array of non-bank markets.
Leach said his bill would repeal Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act and amend Section 32 to allow for the merger of commercial and investment banks.  
Bank subsidiaries would be allowed to engage directly in securities dealing and other activities considered ""part of and incidental to"" banking. Affiliates of bank holding companies, would be allowed to engage in insurance activities as principal, agent or broker.
The bill would also abolish the federal charter for thrifts while grandfathering existing thrift holding companies. National thrifts would have the option of transferring to a national or state bank charter or a state savings and loan charter.
The Iowa Republican's bill would continue to prohibit commercial companies outside the finance sector from owning banks.
The bill was also sponsored by three other Republican members of the Banking Committee: Rep Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Mike Castle of Delaware and Rick Lazio of New York.
The full committee will hold hearings on the bill and any related legislation in early March, Leach said.
The text of Leach's bill is available under the ""daily update"" section of the Banking Committee's World Wide Web site, http://www.house.gov/banking/.",0
"U.S. laws governing the trillion dollar futures markets could be rocked by the Supreme Court's interpretation of the word ""in"" in a case to be argued Wednesday. But a legislative solution is in the offing.
At issue is a 1974 amendment to the Commodity Exchange Act, the primary law regulating trading of futures contracts on everything from wheat and corn to interest rates and electricity.  
Futures exchanges say a broad reading of the amendment would put them out of business, while major banks argue a narrow reading would force them to move vast operations out of the United States.
Whatever the outcome, Congressional action is expected next year. ""It's certainly significant, but I suspect that at the end of the day, legislation will overtake this,"" said Howard Schneider, former Commodity Futures Trading Commission general counsel.  
When Congress expanded the commodity act in 1974 to cover futures on non-agricultural commodities and created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to police the markets, some big banks objected.
They argued the law should not apply to trading of foreign currency, government securities and similiar items already flourishing among banks and securities firms.
The Treasury Department agreed and in a letter to Congress suggested an amendment to the law that became known as the Treasury Amendment.  
The amendment says ""transactions in"" foreign currency, security warrants, repurchase options, government securities and a few other items are exempt from the Commodity Exchange Act unless they involve sale for future delivery conducted ""on a board of trade.""
The banks continued to trade foreign currencies unimpeded but the CFTC began to encounter a new problem. Unscrupulous ""bucket shops"" that peddled off-exchange commodity contracts to rip off unsuspecting investors were expanding into foreign currency schemes.  
The CFTC shut down the forex shops but lawyers for the shops argued forex investment contracts should be considered transactions ""in"" foreign currency and exempt from CFTC rules.
Lower federal courts took up the issue but reached conflicting conclusions. Some said ""transactions in foreign currency"" exempted dealings only with actual currencies, not derivatives on the currencies like futures and options. Others decided that ""in"" exempted all trading involving currencies.
The Supreme Court will likely resolve that conflict in Wednesday's case concerning William Dunn, the manager of a $180 million hedge fund investing in foreign currencies.  
In November, 1993, Dunn told his investors he had lost $95 million. The CFTC soon charged Dunn with fraud under the Commodity Exchange Act. A lower court agreed.
Asking the Supreme Court to uphold that decision, CFTC lawyers argue that Congress would have used the word ""involving"" rather than ""in"" if it had wanted to exempt forex derivatives.
But Dunn's lawyers and four banks that dealt with his fund maintain that the CFTC has no jurisdiction to prosecute under the commodity act.  
Affirming the earlier decision would undermine the $40 billion a day global currency market by subjecting it to unworkable regulation, the banks said. And Dunn, if guilty of any misconduct, could be prosecuted under wire fraud or securities laws, the banks said.
At the other extreme, the Chicago futures exchanges appear terrified the court will strike down the lower court ruling.  
Chicago Board of Trade, in an amicus brief written in part by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, warned that a broad reading of the exemption would create havoc, allowing unregulated dealings in all kinds of futures contracts now traded on exchanges.
""The idea that someone could clone the Board of Trade's principal products, trade them off-exchange and not be subject to any regulation is pretty darn troublesome,"" Mark Young, another exchange attorney, said.
A ruling is not expected for months, but the banks and exchanges will have to continue their struggle in the legislative venue almost immediately.
Congress could resolve the dispute through legislation, which would render the decision moot. One bill was introduced in the last Congress to amend the Treasury Amendment and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) has said he will likely offer a new bill early next year.",0
"The Internet may be overflowing with new technology but crime in cyberspace is still of the old-fashioned variety.
The National Consumers League said Wednesday that the most popular scam on the Internet was the pyramid scheme, in which early investors in a bogus fund are paid off with deposits of later investors.
The league, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, tracks web scams through a site it set up on the world wide web in February called Internet Fraud Watch at http://www.fraud.org.
The site, which collects reports directly from consumers, has been widely praised by law enforcement agencies.
""Consumers who suspect a scam on the Internet have critical information,"" said Jodie Bernstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Internet Fraud Watch ""has been a major help to the FTC in identifying particular scams in their infancy.""
In May, for example, the commission used Internet reports to shut down a site run by Fortuna Alliance that had taken in over $6 million, promising investors they could earn $5,000 a month from an initial deposit of $250. Instead, Fortuna kept most of the money, the commission charged.
Fraud reports from the league's site, which has been visited over 370,000 times, are forwarded to local, state and federal authorities.
The second-most-popular Internet scam, the league said, was the sale of bogus Internet services, such as custom designed web sites or Internet access accounts.
In third place were crooks who sell computer equipment, such as memory chips or sound boards, over the net and then deliver significantly lower quality goods or nothing at all, the league said.
Other top scams involve business opportunities. Con artists may offer shares in a business or franchise using unreasonable predictions or misrepresentations. One popular scheme promised to let consumers get rich while working at home.
The League also announced Tuesday that NationsBank had donated $100,000 to become a sponsor of the Fraud Watch site.",0
"Two of Britain's leading insurance brokers Lloyd Thompson Group and JIB Group said on Monday they are to merge in a deal worth 300 million pounds ($496.4 million)
Lloyd Thompson chief executive Ken Carter said the main attraction of the deal was the complementary nature of the two companies' operations and the merger will create an international firm focused on profitable, growth businesses.
""The driver is not cost savings, it's entirely the business enhancements we can get out of the two groups coming together. The cost savings will be there but they would come out in the merger of any two companies,"" he said.
Carter will become chief executive of the new group which is to be renamed Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Plc.
The deal comes at a time of increasing problems for brokers as insurance rates fall and revenues decline. Increasing competitive pressures are forcing many to contemplate deals to find a way of cutting costs and achieve economies of scale.
Only last week U.S. broking giant Aon Corp announced it was buying New York's Alexander & Alexander services for $1.23 billion.
""Insurance brokers are going through very difficult times and any activity that will enhance margins has to be beneficial,"" said one analyst. ""It's becoming quite evident that size is more and more important."" Under the terms of the Lloyd's Thompson offer, JIB shareholders will receive four new Lloyd Thompson shares for every five JIB shares held. The companies said that deal was expected to be ""significantly earnings enhancing"" in 1998.
The merger has received the backing of Jardine Matheson Holdings which has a 60 percent stake in JIB. On completion of the merger it will have a 34 percent interest which it said, it intended to hold ""for the long term"".
The stock market reacted positively to the news. JIB shares rose 20-1/2p to 129-1/2p and Lloyd Thompson 1-1/2p to 174p.
The companies said they believed that the merger would bring significant strategic advantages allowing the development of new products, enhancing JIB's international operations and creating a leading international reinsurance business.
The deal would also deliver cost savings, in particular in the two London market operations' information technology and head office expenditure.
Lloyd Thompson, is currently involved predominantly in the London wholesale and reinsurance broking business. In contrast, JIB, operates in 30 countries worldwide and brings with it an international presence with the ""very significant jewel in the crown"" of its high quality Asia Pacific business, said Carter.
The newly merged group will be positioned between global brokers such as Britain's Sedgwick and Willis Corroon and smaller niche brokers such as Lowndes Lambert and C.E. Heath.
""We see Jardine fulfilling an essential demand from clients by being a strong international broker focussed on handling business wherever it is in the world outside the U.S. rather than looking to get a flag in every city in the world,"" said Carter.
Following the merger John Barton, currently chief executive of JIB will become chairman of the new group which is to be headquartered in London.",0
"The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), responsible for overseeing financial regulation in Britain, has clamped down on the use of stockmarket derivatives to profit from inside information.
SIB said on Thursday that firms should ensure they do not use derivatives to buy or sell stakes for themselves or customers where inside information would have prevented them from doing so in the open market.
Front-line regulators such as the Securities and Futures Authority are to have day-to-day responsibility for enforcing the guidance, designed to ban the improper use of inside information in the derivatives market.
Derivatives such as futures or options, are financial instruments derived from the value of an underlying asset such as a stock or a bond.
The 1993 Criminal Justice Act which made insider dealing a criminal offence only covers individuals, but firms are expected to observe the spirit, as well as the letter, of the new advice, said SIB.
It also said that firms should not rely on arguments about equality of information' -- that the information is widely known -- to justify such stakes, even where this defence could be relied on in relation to the criminal law.
Neither should they rely on the defence, called bid facilitation', if taking a stake provides only a cash benefit rather than a step towards completing a takeover bid for a client.
The SIB said its advice was based partly on the standards set in the criminal law on insider dealing, and that authorised firms are required under SIB principles to meet a higher standard in some areas than may be imposed on individuals by the criminal law.
The SIB published a consultative paper on the issue in June.",0
"Abbey National on Monday called for Scottish Amicable to put on hold proposals to drop its mutual status and allow policyholders time to consider last week's offer for the life assurance group.
But ScotAm were quick to reject the demand together with renewed requests by Abbey for access to its books.
ScotAm said it had no intention of altering its plans and would proceed according to its own timetable and not one dictated by Abbey.
""They're asking for privileged access to information before policyholders,"" said a ScotAm spokesman.
""The policyholders have to get that information, see the detail of what we're offering and at that time Abbey can make a proper judgement of its offer.""
The details of ScotAm's demutualisation and flotation plans are due to be published at the beginning of next week.
Until then an impasse looks likely with ScotAm refusing to discuss Abbey's approach and Abbey prevented from seeing more detailed financial information it says it needs.
It argues that policyholders should have the opportunity to compare ScotAm's plans with alternative offers based on the same information.
""Ours is a firm offer based on published information and it is a minimum offer. If we had the information they have, we'd be on the same level playing field,"" said an Abbey spokesman.
""The policyholders should be given the chance to vote on the best deal on the table. If Scottish know there's a firm offer from us - and there may be other interested parties - they should consider all of these and put them to policyholders at one go.""
Many industry observers expect the move by Abbey which already owns Glasgow-based Scottish Mutual, to prompt an auction for ScotAm with interest anticipated from both Britain and overseas.
Insurance group Prudential has said it was ""watching the situation with interest"" and has made no secret that it is on the lookout for an acquisition in the life assuarnce sector.
Britain's Halifax building society, high street banking group National Westminster, Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services company, and Dutch firm ING Groep have all declined to comment on reports they might throw their hats in the ring.
No talks have been held with any other parties and according to the ScotAm, none are planned ahead of the publication of its proposals. For the time being at least, the company remains dismissive of Abbey's approach.
It has repeatedly attacked what it describes as the ""vagueness"" of Abbey's offer - a minimum of 400 million pounds ($641 million) and between 700 million and one billion pounds for the embedded value of the with-profits fund.
But the company was keen to stress that the interests of policyholders remained the most important consideration and if a suitable offer emerged it would be put to policyholders.
""The kite being flown by Abbey has all the superficial attractions of an upfront cash offer to policyholders without any assurance of the long term welfare of policies,"" ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart told Reuters.
""Abbey has said more to the press than it has put in writing to the board and that should alert policyholders that it's time for very careful reflection.""",0
"Scottish Amicable on Monday confirmed that three companies had submitted final offers for the mutually-owned insurance group by last Friday's bid deadline.
High street bank Abbey National plc and insurers Prudential Corp plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) must now wait until the end of the month to find out who has won the fight for control of the hotly-pursued ScotAm.
None of the bidders have taken up the option of making their offers public, allowing the company's board and its advisers SBC Warburg to weigh up the competing bids behind closed doors.
In an effort to deflect criticism of the sealed-bid process ScotAm had agreed to publish details of offers, if asked to do so by a bidder.
But for the moment all three seem content to abide by Scotam's preference for confidentiality. They have also committed themselves to accepting its decision at the end of March as final.
The board's endoresement will go a long way in ultimately securing ownership of the group but does not guarantee it.
Two-thirds of the 1.1 million policyholders who own the company must approve the choice and after widespread criticism of management's handling of both its own plans to float ScotAm and the auction process, its recommendation is likely to come under close scrutiny.
ScotAm, based in Stirling in central Scotland, has arranged for an independent tribunal to resolve any dispute arising from the takeover battle and has repeatedly stressed that the interests of its policyholders will be uppermost in its decision.
Those interests are likely to be focused upon bidders' long-term investment plans rather than upfront payouts and one of Warburg's main difficulties will be comparing very differently structured proposals.
Independent actuaries and the Department of Trade & Industry are to be consulted before the final decision is made.
Job security for ScotAm's 2,200 employees is also likely to play a major part and all three bidders have been quick to calm fears of job cuts.
AMP has said it would consider moving its Bristol-based London Life business to Scotland if it won while both Abbey and the Pru have said job preservation in Stirling would be a priority.
AMP, Abbey and the Pru are all that are left of half a dozen companies, including National Westminster Bank and Lloyds TSB who last month signed confidentiality agreements with ScotAm to evaluate the company as a takeover prospect.
The price tag -- widely expected to top two billion pounds ($3.2 billion) -- has been cited by many companies as the reason for withdrawing from the race with acquisition goodwill likely to top one billion pounds.
AMP has made no effort to disguise its desire to expand in both the British and U.S. market and has said it would shift its attention to another target if it were to miss out on ScotAm.
Both the Pru and Abbey have already said that their original proposals might be increased once they had access to more detailed financial detail on ScotAm.
Abbey's original bid was worth up to 1.4 billion pounds while the Pru's 1.9 billion pound offer included a loan element to bolster ScotAm's life fund.
Those bids came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float itself on the stock market.

"About three million Norwich Union  policyholders are to receive free shares under flotation plans announced on Thursday that would value the insurer at about five billion pounds ($8 billion).
Almost two million will receive shares worth 800 pounds on average and another one million ""non-profit"" members of the mutually-owned insurance group will receive a fixed hand-out of shares worth between 330 and 400 pounds on the group's flotation in June.
The demutalisation and flotation - the first by a British insurer - will rank Norwich among Britain's largest 50 companies.
Norwich Union's 10,000 employees will share in the giveaway, receiving 150 shares each.
Norwich's adviser Dresdner Kleinwort Benson estimated the shares would be worth between 220 and 265 pence each had they been listed at the end of February.
The company, Britain's third largest life insurer, also unveiled plans to raise a further 1.75 billion pounds through an offer of new shares in May.
Existing Norwich members will be able to purchase shares at a discount, the size of which has yet to be finalised.
Members will vote on the proposals at an extraordinary meeting in London on April 18 with the company needing the backing of three-quarters of those who vote.
The size of the planned payouts is comfortably ahead of the 500 pounds many industry observers had expected.
Norwich chief executive Allan Bridegwater said he believed the group's mutual structure was no longer appropriate and that flotation was the best way forward for the company and its members.
""The distribution of free shares represents a significant release of value to qualifying members,"" he said.
""The discounted offer of additional shares will give members a further opportunity to participate in the future of Norwich Union.""
The share handout will be worth a total of around 3.1 billion pounds. The two million with-profit members will receive a minimum of 300 shares with additional shares based on the value and duration of their holdings as of October 1, 1996.
Three-quarters of with-profit policyholders - life insurance policies which share in the investment profits of the life fund through bonuses - will get between 300 and 600 shares. Non-profit members will get a fixed allocation of 150 shares.
Most of Norwich Union's half-a-million overseas members will have the choice of a cash payment instead of free shares.
The flotation will allow the separation of the group's life operations from the risks associated with its more volatile and cyclical general business.
It will also strengthen the group's financial position and allow the core life business greater investment freedom.
The general insurance business will be transferred from the life fund to shareholder ownership and the life and pensions operations to a subsidiary company.
Norwich Union, which reported pre-tax profit in 1996 of 483 million pounds, said it believed the opportunities for sustained growth were good but that results in its general insurance arm would continue to be affected by pricing pressure in 1997, particularly in Britain.
Around 1.5 billion pounds of the money raised under today's plans will go into the with-profits fund to enable the company to continue to keep up policy benefits to existing policyholders.
The balance, less the 120 million pound cost of the flotation, will be used for corporate purposes.
While the company did not rule out the possibility of future acquisitions, it said it had no immediate plans to do so and was not ""raising a war chest.""
Policyholders circulars were due to be mailed on Thursday and the group expects the prospectus for the additional share offer to be issued in May. ($ = 0.624 British Pounds)",0
"International insurance broker Willis Corroon, reported a rise in 1996 profits on Thursday but gave a gloomy assessment of the problems of overcapacity and falling rates currently afflicting the industry.
The company said insurance rates were declining almost universally and competition in the U.S. retail market was intensifying.
It also warned that the recent rise in sterling which reduced 1996 profits by 3.1 million pounds ($5.1 million) may hit 1997 results and that profits from its Lloyd's members agency were unlikely to be repeated at the 1996 level.
The comments were made as Willis unveiled pre-tax profits for the year of 91.6 million pounds, a rise of 83 percent over 1995, which included 30 million pounds in exceptional charges.
Stripping out exceptionals and disposals, profits from continuing operations were up 13 percent at 89.1 million pounds.
Willis said it expected to benefit from a programme designed to enhance performance and competitiveness but the shares lost ground after the results, slipping eight pence by early afternoon to 131-1/2 pence.
Analysts said the results merely confirmed the difficulties the sector faced.
Willis chairman John Reeve, however, pointed to the rise in profits and elimination of net debt as evidence of the successful implementation of plans to restore the group's financial health.
""The group is now focused on its core operation, following a programme of disposal, profitability has been improved and the balance sheet has been significantly strengthened,"" Reeve said.
Willis also drew comfort from its success in growing revenues and despite the difficult market conditions. it said it remained sceptical about the benefits of the recent industry trend of pursuing cost economies through mergers.
""We think there are huge risks in people businessses associated with that. We have a strategy for growing our business which we're comfortable with and as far as we're concerned that's what we're concentrating on,"" group executive director Max Taylor told Reuters in an interview.
Following the implementation of the Lloyd's of London Reconstruction and Renewal plan (R&R) the group's members agency returned to profit for the first time since 1992.
The 14.5 million pound profit commission for the 1993 year included reserves from prior years. These were partly offset by contributions of 6.3 million pounds to the R&R plan.
Willis said present indications were that profit commission on the 1994 year, receivable in 1997, will be around half those of 1993.
Profits for the 1995 year were likely to be significantly down, however, said one analyst, and there were big questions over whether it would be profitable at all in 1997 given the rating environment.
After severance costs of 11.3 million pounds in the 1996 figures related to the change programme, Taylor said he expected further costs in 1997 to be lower.
He said a fall in staff numbers of 11 percent in 1996 was unlikely to be repeated and further reductions were expected to be on a smaller scale and absorbed through natural wastage.
The change programme is expected to span three to five years and last year's actions were taken to underpin it. The real effort would now be going into the longer term effort of building capabilities, skills and resources, said Taylor.

"Fund manager Nicola Horlick's row with her ex-employer Morgan Grenfell Asset Management (MGAM) continued to be played out in public on Wednesday as she admitted that she had been in talks with a rival banking group until several days before she was suspended.
But Horlick stressed that the talks with Dutch firm ABN AMRO were of an ""informal and preliminary nature"" and at no time had she provided confidential information about the business or colleagues.
""The talks terminated several days before I was suspended,"" said Horlick. ""My aim was always to keep the clients and the team together for the benefit of all.""
The benefit of all included MGAM whom, she said, she had never intended to leave.
Horlick, one of London's most prominent fund managers, resigned last week after being suspended amid allegations she planned to defect to ABN AMRO and was soliciting MGAM colleagues to go with her.
The suspension came just days after she had been promoted to be managing director of MGAM and since then her fight to be reinstated or compensated for the loss of her job has rarely been out of the headlines.
Once again the lure of the cameras proved difficult to resist on Wednesday and in a television interview, Horlick repeated her determination to clear her name.
""When you're faced with the fact that people are saying that you've done something wrong and you know you haven't you have to fight for yourself. It's one individual versus a very large bank,"" she said. ""All I have is my reputation and I must defend myself.""
The 35 year-old mother-of-five's battle with MGAM has raised eyebrows in the traditionally discreet and conservative banking industry but she maintained she saw no alternative to the action she had taken.
Horlick was catapulted onto the front pages last Friday when she turned up on MGAM's doorstep with a posse of journalists to confront her former employyers after her resignation.
Later to the surprise of everbody -- including her own lawyers -- she flew to Frankfurt to put her case to officials at MGAM's parent company Deutsche Bank.
ABN AMRO has denied trying to poach Horlick and her team and today said they had nothing to add to earlier statements.
Horlick has been in talks with her lawyers for the past few days and is considering taking legal action against her former employer for constructive dismissal.
MGAM is holding fast to its line that it will not reinstate Horlick nor offer compensation since she took the decision to resign her position.",0
"Insurance group Guardian Royal Exchange PLC on Tuesday reported a sharp fall in 1996 profits and said it was considering a major acquisition within the next twelve months, possibly in the life sector.
The company blamed tough competition and the worst catastrophe weather claims in the U.S. for 75 years for the profits decline, while bad weather and continuing subsidence losses in Britain also taking a toll.
But news that Guardian may spend around one billion pounds ($1.6 billion) on a life acquisition and disappointment that it had no plans to return capital to shareholders prompted the shares to reverse an initial rise on the back of the results.
The company told industry analysts that a UK life acquisition was top of the list, that it could comfortably spend one billion pounds and would be prepared to spend more if necessary.
Guardian is not a major player in the UK life market and on the plus side an acquisition could give it critical mass and economies of scale.
But the possible goodwill write off such an  acquisition could prompt was a concern, analysts said.
""Guardian looks very expensive on both an earnings and a dividend basis. The asset value is the only rationale as to why the shares are sitting at current levels,"" said one.
""Any large life acquisition would almost certainly result in paying a very substantial premium to asset value.""
The decline in 1996 profits was broadly in-line with market expectations. Despite continuing pressures on margins, Guardian chief executive John Robins said there were bright spots.
The company had seen some hardening of premiums in selected sectors and regions such as British motor insurance and difficult conditions in Germany had not been as severe as some commentators had forecast.
It predicted rates in the motor market could rise by as much as eight percent over the next twelve months with household rates likely to see smaller increases of the order of two percent.
Competition in commercial markets continued to be fierce, though even here there were hopes of an upturn in rates by the end of the year.
For 1996, however, Guardian trading profits were down over 17 percent at 281 million pounds, before restructuring costs of 39 million pounds.
Pre-tax profits including investment gains dropped to 651 million pounds from 812 million pounds last year. Total premium income was down only slightly at 3.73 billion pounds.
While competition had risen and was likely to increase further, Guardian said it was confident about the future and that this was reflected in the increase in the dividend payout for the year by one pence to 10.0 pence per share.
The figures were broadly in line with market expectations although the headline operating profit was flattered by reserve releases to the tune of 10 to 15 million pounds and by a profit contribution from the internal reinsurance operation which may not be repeated.
Progress had been made on the integration of last year's acquisition of Legal & General's commercial business and of the RAC insurance business.
Restructuring of the group's operations in Britain was also moving ahead, the company said.
A new management structure was set up at the beginning of 1997 and cost savings in the next two years are expected to equal this year's 39 million pounds of exceptional charges.
Those charges are expected to cover all the costs required to complete the restructuring over the next 12 to 18 months and while these might include further redundancies, these were unlikely to be of the same order of previous rounds of layoffs. ($ = 0.612 British Pounds)",0
"The drive to cut costs and offset falling margins in insurance broking continued apace on Thursday as Lowndes Lambert Group Holdings Plc and Fenchurch Plc confirmed that they are to merge.
The two London-based brokers announced last week they were in talks and said the complementary nature of their businesses would offer significant benefits to clients, employees and shareholders.
The merger comes against a background of industry over-capacity and intense competition which has put increasing pressure on margins and led to an acceleration in consolidation as companies search for economies of scale.
The companies said they believed the deal would create a stronger, more broadly based and competitive group better positioned to win new business and revenues.
Another attraction of the deal is the scope it offers for cutting costs through the merger of head offices, the companies' branch networks and the rationalisation of support and administrative functions.
Such moves will produce cost saving of at least five million pounds in the 12 months to March 1998 and together with the improved prospects for revenue growth will significantly enhance earnings and dividend propects, the company said.
Fenchurch shareholders are to be offered 628 shares in the new company, to be called Lambert Fenchurch Group, for every 1,000 shares they hold, valuing Fenchurch at around 27.6 million pounds ($46.18 million).
Last year's results for the two groups highlight the difficulties faced in the industry with Lowndes' reporting a nine percent fall in pre-tax profits to 13.9 million pounds.
Fenchurch's profits dropped 27 percent to 5.9 million pounds, prompting it to more than halve its final dividend.
The deal comes just weeks after Lloyd Thompson Group Plc and JIB Group Plc announced they are to merge in a deal worth just under 300 million pounds.
The companies believe today's move will reinforce operations in areas where both are strong such as the the UK retail, marine cargo, international non-marine and reinsurance markets.
Lowndes position in marine, fine art and entertainment will also be complimented by Fenchurch's position in North American non-marine and aviation and the broad spread of operations would offer improved growth potential, they said.
Future growth is to be pursued through a combination of organic growth and acquisition.
Lowndes chief executive David Margrett is to become chief executive of the new group with Lowndes chairman Sir Robert Clark becomning non-executive chairman.
The costs of the merger are expected to amount to around 11 million pounds.",0
"Lloyd's of London said on Thursday it had been granted judgements in two test cases against members who had failed to pay debts under the insurance market's reconstruction and renewal (R&R) settlement.
The defendants, Dennis Leighs and David Wilkinson, had claimed they were not liable to pay their premium to Equitas, the company set up to reinsure and run-off pre-1993 liabilities of Lloyd's syndicates.
But the judge, Mr Justice Colman, said that they had failed to establish that any of the grounds argued represented ""arguable defences or, if these actions were permitted to go to trial, would have any realistic prospect of success"".
Lloyd's welcomed the decision and said it would now be pursuing other non-acceptors.
""This judgement enables Lloyd's to pursue all non-acceptors of the settlement who have argued that they are not obliged to pay their Equitas premium,"" said Philip Holden, head of Lloyd's financial recovery department.
""Our pursuit will be vigorous and, by virtue of this judgement, will be effective.""
He said it was in the interests of all members that Lloyd's now proceeded to recover all outstanding debts.
It originally brought proceedings against three Names but dropped one because of concern over the defendant's age and ill health.

"Britannic Assurance on Tuesday promised to speed-up the settlement of cases of pension mis-selling as the insurance group reported a near 50 percent jump in its profits for 1996.
The company admitted it had between 12,000 and 13,000 cases classified as priority cases but said that the resources already committed to the issue would help accelerate the resolution of those outstanding.
""Our objective is to complete a substantial proportion of priority cases this year... But that depends not only on our own resources but on the ability of occupational schemes to answer our queries,"" said Britannic chief executive Brian Shaw.
The industry was now in a much better position to clear up the backlog, he said, thanks to the work done over the past couple of years.
Pension providers have come under increasing criticism for the delays in compensating victims of pensions mis-selling in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
As many as 1-1/2 million people may have been wrongly advised by the financial services industry to take out personal pensions instead of staying in occupational schemes.
A review was launched in 1994 but only a tiny proportion of those affected have so far received compensation.
The Personal Investment Authority (PIA), which regulates the sale of investment products to the public, came under heavy fire last week for its handling of the scandal.
Shaw made his comments as Britannic reported a 47 percent increase in pre-tax profits to 93.9 million pounds ($149 million), helped by a 23 million pound boost related to February's announcement of a 209 million pound special bonus for policyholders.
The bonus resulted from a government clarification of ownership of 'orphan' assets -- money surplus to policyholders' needs in with-profit funds.
Under an agreement with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), 902 million pounds of the 5.68 billion pound life fund has been attributed to shareholders.
That helped lift the dividend by 82 percent to 28 pence per share, which Shaw said would provide the basis for double-digit dividend increases in the future.
Britannic shares added 12 pence to 871 pence.
Following a strategic review of its businesses, the company said it would be looking to build on its brand, investment management, distribution skills and product development capabilities to deliver enhanced value to shareholders and policyholders.
It also said that reversionary bonus scales for traditional business -- bonuses added to policyholder's investment during the course of the policy -- would be unchanged with modest reductions in annual bonus rates for unitised business.
Terminal bonuses for traditional business have been maintained.
New regular premiums rose 7.7 percent to 37 million pounds in 1996 and single premiums 16.8 percent to 137 million pounds.
It was also announced that William Haynes has been appointed to the Britannic board as sales and marketing director. ($ = 0.630 British Pounds)",0
"The battle for control of Scottish Amicable became a three-way race on Friday as the deadline for firm offers for the mutually-owned life insurer passed.
The company said that it had received three initial bids from high street bank Abbey National Plc and insurance groups Prudential Corp Plc and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP).
Details of the bids were not released.
While technically the door is still open for other bidders to come in, a source close to the deal said that was ""unrealistic"" at this stage.
Under the terms of the auction process, ScotAm agreed it would make firm offers public if required by a bidder. It said none had asked it to do so.
With the auction effectively a sealed-bid process and bidders unable to see competing offers, there would appear to be little advantage in one company giving rivals a target by making public its own proposals.
AMP development director Jonathan Schwarz said the group believed it would be wrong to handicap discussions with ScotAm by conducting them in the ""glare of publicity"".
Both the Pru and Abbey said they had nothing to add to earlier statements.
Discussions with the three companies will be held with a view to obtaining final offers by mid-March.
ScotAm chairman Sandy Stewart said the three proposals represented an ""excellent outcome to this phase of the process"".
""We can now move on to the next phase with every expectation of delivering maximum value to policyholders.""
The company said it would not be expressing an opinion on the merits or otherwise of any proposal until the evaluation process was complete. Last week ScotAm asked for firm offers for the company by today. It hopes to recommend a single proposal to policyholders by the end of March.
National Westminster Bank was among a ""about half a dozen"" companies which signed confidentiality agreements to gain access to ScotAm's books but pulled out earlier this week. Lloyds TSB has also admitted it ran the slide rule over ScotAm but said it felt the bid premium looked too high. Schwarz said ScotAm was one of a number of current opportunities which fulfilled the group's criteria. He said the group was looking to acquire British and U.S. businesses with quality local management, marketing and distribution in place which, with the backing of AMP's financial strength, could deliver ""substantial organic growth"". The auction was sparked by Abbey National's bid for the company at the end of January. That came barely two weeks after ScotAm had released its own proposals to drop mutual status and float on the London stock market. Abbey's offer was topped a week later by the Pru's 1.9 billion pound ($3.1 billion) bid, though that figure includes a 1.1 billion pound loan element. Both companies have said that their offers may be raised when they had more detailed financial information on ScotAm.

"Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc said on Friday it would be making a first half provision of 50 million pounds ($81.4 million) after finding mispricing errors in the interest rate options book of its Natwest Markets unit.
The bank said a senior trader had been suspended for ""failure to supervise"", pending the conclusion of an internal inquiry.
A second trader, who had resigned from NatWest before the errors had been discovered, has been reported to the Securities & Futures Authority (SFA) regulator.
NatWest said that no clients had been affected by the discovery, adding that the Bank of England was being kept informed.
The SFA confirmed NatWest Markets had sent it information which it was now studying.
An SFA spokesman said no statement was planned at the moment.
""Clearly we have to look at the information, assess the situation and decidewhat is the next step foward.""
A Bank of England spokesman also declined to comment further.
Dealers were left guessing who was behind the transactions that led to the provision or even whether they took place on an exchange or the over-the-counter options market.
The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the site for a large part of London's options trading, had no immediate comment on the news.
Options are contracts which give buyers the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying security at a set price in the future.
Mispricing could arise in various ways, for instance, a broker could be given a price from clients but somehow get the price wrong in executing the trade.
One options dealer suggested it could be down to how an individual dealt with issues such as margins on his firm's trades.
""Basically if you're a senior trader or a top person you can actually change prices or positions for margining,"" the dealer said.
One highlight of Natwest Markets' results released earlier this week was a 25 percent rise in profits from what it called ""other dealing"" to 171 million pounds.
That was mainly the result of strong increases in rate risk management products, among them interest rate options.
Derivatives markets have been involved in a string of large losses for companies around the world.
While the exact nature of the ""mispricing errors"" is unknown at this stage, the memory of Nick Leeson's activities in the derivatives market is still fresh in many minds.
The $1.4 billion losses run up by Leeson eventually led to the collapse of Barings in 1995 and its subsequent acquisition by Dutch bank ING .
The banking industry attracted more bad publicity last year after Morgan Grenfell sacked fund manger Peter Young after it was discovered he had breached rules on investing in unlisted companies.
The huge bonuses paid out by banks has been cited by some as one reason for the high risks some, like Leeson, are prepared to take.
Only yesterday Donald Gordon, a leading figure in the financial services industry and chairman of Liberty International attacked the payment of large bonuses by investment banks as a ""massive over-incentivisation of personnel"".
He said it had produced an ""excessively materialistic culture"" in the world's finacial markets which had led to a number of financial accidents and would undoubtedly lead to more dramatic catastrophes in the years to come. ($ = 0.614 British Pounds)",0
"United Nations' plans to delay Iraq's re-entry to world oil markets lifted oil shares in Europe on Monday as a sharp rise in oil prices fed through to the stock markets, traders said.
Iraqi military activity in the Kurdish north, prompted the U.N. to put on hold a planned humanitarian Iraqi oil-for-food exchange, stopping the first sales of Iraqi oil since the Gulf War six years ago.
The increased tension in the Middle East and delays to Iraqi supplies lifted crude prices and, said analysts, was likely to raise market estimates for the third and probably fourth quarter.
October futures for benchmark Brent crude opened 70 cents a barrel higher on London's international Petroleum Exchange.
Shares in Enterprise Oil climbed 10-1/2p to 520p, while Lasmo rose three to 196-1/2. British Petroleum was up 5-1/2p at 628p and Shell Transport 6-1/2p at 939p. In Amsterdam, Royal Dutch rose 2.70 guilders to 250.70.
The Iraqi humanitarian oil sales had been expected to hit markets in the next few weeks but after the latest developments traders were questioning when and if those supplies would come back on stream.
That could mean an upward revision of as much as $1.50 on Brent crude oil prices for the next few months with the possibility of the Iraqi sales ban lasting into 1997.
""I'd rather wait and see how likely or how long delays to Iraqi sales are going to be before I get too panicky,"" said one leading oil analyst.
""Almost certainly there is going to be a strong fourth quarter now as well as the third. People are going to have upgrade numbers for this year but for next year it's a bit early to say.""
The resultant boost to earnings forecasts are likely to provide support to share prices across the sector with most analysts having expected an oil price fall in the fourth quarter as the humanitarian sales came through.
Consensus forecasts had been around $17.70 per barrel for the fourth quarter compared with an average of just under $20 in the third, analysts said.
""We were forecasting $19.50 for the third. We'll have to raise that in the light of this news and also our fourth quarter which was $17.50 by between $1 and $1.50 per barrel,"" said Lehman Bros' Wendy Anderson.
""The purest plays are the exploration and production companies - Enterprise, Lasmo and Saga. You pick a pure play if you believe the delay will last into 1997,"" said Anderson.
Integrated majors Norsk Hydro, BP, Elf, Total and Royal Dutch/Shell also provided fairly good exposure, she said.
Total shares rose 4.2 francs at 376.7 in Paris and Elf gained 7.6 francs to 376.4. Norsk Hydro added two Norwegian crowns to 296.50.
But while the Iraqi situation will underpin stocks in the near term, it is long-term trends that will determine significant outperformance in the sector.
The real issue was at what point -- if at all -- people decided that forecasts for oil prices through 1997, 1998 and 1999 should be higher, said Nick Antill of BZW.
""At this stage I don't see anything that would make one want to do that. In investment terms, the sector is only really going to start motoring if people start bumping up the long-term trend rather than just this year's estimate,"" he said.",0
"Britain's Britannic Assurance declared on Tuesday a 209 million pound ($336 million) special bonus for life insurance policies, following discussions with the government on ownership of surplus insurance funds.
The payout will apply to all ""with profits"" policies in force on February 17, 1997. Details will be given with the 1996 bonus due to be announced next month.
The company said last year it discussing with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) ownership of long-term assets, and a way to distribute the surplus to policyholders and shareholders.
Britannic has now agreed with the DTI that 902 million pounds of the excess assets within the long term fund can be attributable to shareholders.
Britannic also said it intended to increase its dividend for the year by 82 percent to 23 pence per share following an increase in life profits. This would be the basis for continuing the company's progressive dividend policy.
The news boosted Britannic shares, which jumped 71 pence, or nearly nine percent, at one stage before settling for a rise of 29 pence at 832.5.
The money attributable to shareholders forms part of total assets in the life funds which amounted to 5.682 billion pounds at the end of 1995.
Those assets were estimated to have risen by the end of 1996, Britannic chief executive Brian Shaw said, and updated figures would be released on March 18.
Britannic also announced a restructuring of its long-term funds and the results of a strategic review of its business.
The review will lead to new sales management and premium collection systems, streamlining of head office and investment in market analysis and product research.
The initiatives are expected to cut operating costs by around 25 million pounds, based on 1995 figures.
Britannic said it planned to build on its brand, investment management and distribution skills, financial strength and product development abilities to strengthen its position and improve value to policy and shareholders.
Restructuring the long-term fund will create two continuing ""with profits"" funds, one for its industrial branch and the other for the ordinary branch -- life and pensions business.
In future at least 90 percent of the surplus in the with profits funds will be allocated each year to with profits policies. The balance will be shareholders' profit for transfer to the profit and loss account.
The company has also created two separate non-profit sub funds -- one for life, one for pensions -- which will contain non-profits business and both of which will be owned by shareholders.
The shareholder transfer for 1996 will be increased by 23 million pounds following the declaration of the 209 million pound special bonus. ($ = 0.621 British Pounds)",0
"Prudential Corp Plc, Britain's biggest life insurance group, reported a healthy rise in profits on Wednesday and said British operations were expected to perform strongly again in the coming year.
But the company made no comment about negotiations with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) over the ownership of so-called orphan assets.
Prudential (Pru) finance director Jonathan Bloomer said discussions with the DTI were continuing, but said it was difficult to say how long they would last.
""We always thought they would take a long time and there's nothing sensible that can be added to that. I think discussions will continue for a while yet this year.""
One analyst suggested that it was encouraging that the company had passed up the opportunity to tone down expectations.
The Pru is believed to be looking to free up around three billion pounds ($4.9 billion) of orphan assets -- money built up in with-profits funds surplus to policyholders' needs.
Pru operating profits for the year rose over eight percent to 873 million pounds, with profits from continuing operations of 691 million pounds.
The combination of the confidence about new business prospects in 1997 and a higher-than-expected level of profitable new business in 1996 helped lift the shares by 11 pence to 574 pence.
A 10 percent rise in the dividend to a slightly higher than forecast 17.3 pence per share also provided support.
Pru's chief executive Sir Peter Davis called it a very successful year and said the results demonstrated the strength of the group's core business.
With the disposal of Mercantile & General (M&G) and the launch of Prudential Banking, considerable progress had been made in focusing the group on markets where the Pru had the expertise and the critical mass to generate real value for shareholders, he said.
The sale of M&G for 1.75 billion pounds in December realised a profit of 766 million pounds.
Prudential Banking, launched on October 1, is already processing applications for 103 million pounds of mortgages and has taken 98 million pounds in deposits.
The company plans to expand the product range and move in to the personal loan market later this year.
Bloomer repeated the Pru's interest in establishing the high street distribution network which a building society acquisition would provide. With net cash at year-end standing at 1.1 billion pounds, the group has the financial strength to contemplate such a move.
But Bloomer said it was unlikely to make a move unless it enhanced shareholder value which, given current price levels in the sector, may be difficult to pull off.
The Pru is currently involved in a takeover battle for Scottish Amicable and made an initial 1.9 billion pound offer for the mutually-owned life insurer earlier this month, only 250 million pounds of which will come from shareholders' funds.
Prudential UK operating profits from the insurance business increased eight percent to 398 million pounds and profits for the savings and investment business were 323 million pounds, an increase of six percent.
After cutting Prudential UK's cost base by 170 million pounds over the past four years, it was approaching a point of diminishing returns, though the group was looking to reduce unit costs further, Bloomer said.
U.S. operations Jackson National Life saw operating profits growing 35 percent to $512 million.
While confident about the outlook for the business, Bloomer said growth was unlikely to continue at the 40 percent rate seen in recent years. ($ = 0.610 British Pounds)",0
"British life assurer Scottish Amicable said on Thursday it planned to shed its 170-year-old mutual status in favour of a stock market flotation aimed at taking advantage of opportunities for profit growth.
The Stirling-based group outlined plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in three to five years' time and said it would pay policy-holders an initial special bonus of 75 million pounds ($125 million) after demutualising on May 1.
Scottish Amicable said pay-outs would be based on the length of time policies had been held by members.
The fist payment would be followed by benefits worth more than 200 million pounds as a result of flotation, which will give the group access to long-term capital, it added.
The group said it expected to have a market capitalisation of around 1.0 billion pounds on flotation.
Scottish Amicable said significant opportunities existed for profitable growth in its businesses. But it said in a statement that to take full advantage ""requires access to external capital in both the short and long term.""
There has been intense speculation that Scottish Amicable, founded in 1826, would be the subject of a takeover bid but chairman Sandy Stewart said the group intended to hold on to its independence.
""Our plans do not include being gobbled up by anybody,"" he told a news briefing.
The group said the process would be in two stages. Under the plan, the business, staff and operations of the group would be transferred to a new company, Scottish Amicable Life, a 100 percent subsidiary of newly formed Scottish Amicable Holdings.
The first stage involves a deal with reinsurance giant Swiss Re and its affiliate Securitas Capital ""to provide substantial financial backing initially totalling 395 million pounds"".
Under this agreement Scottish Amicable's existing with-profit fund will receive an immediate cash contribution of 350 million pounds ""from the reinsurance by Swiss Re of certain categories of existing policy"".
Securitas Capital has committed to invest up to 45 million pounds in return for approximately 20 percent of a new business fund being set up to transact all new business from the date on which the scheme becomes effective.
Swiss Re has also agreed to provide further reinsurance ""expected to reach a level of 150 million pounds over the next five years in respect of future new business"".
Scottish Amicable said Roy Nicolson, currently managing director of the group, would become group chief executive of Scottish Amicable Holdings, while Paul Bradshaw, deputy managing director, will become chief executive of Scottish Amicable Life.",0
"Three companies are expected to be left in the running for control of mutually-owned life insurance company Scottish Amicable at the deadline for final offers on Friday evening.
Insurance groups Prudential Corp and Australian Mutual Provident (AMP) and high street bank Abbey National have all been working on offers to be weighed up by the ScotAm board and its advisers SBC Warburg.
A source close to Warburgs said a bidder from outside the three front-runers was not anticipated.
The sifting of the offers is likely to take place behind closed doors with not one of the likely bidders opting to make public details of its proposals.
In an effort to deflect criticism of the sealed-bid process ScotAm had agreed to publish details of offers, if required by a bidder.
For the moment, none have asked it to do so.
""We're not at this stage asking for our bid to be revealed. I think everybody's waiting to see whether anyone wants to have a shootout now - it's a bit of a stand off... it's very much a case of playing by ScotAm's rules,"" said a source close to one of the bidders.
Those rules include confidentiality agreements and an undertaking to accept the board's decision, expected by the end of the month, as final.
ScotAm, based in Stirling in central Scotland, has arranged for an independent tribunal to resolve any dispute arising from the the takeover battle.
The board has repeatedly stressed that the interests of its 1.1 million policyholders will be uppermost in its final decision.
Those interests are not limited to headline figures and upfront payouts but extend to the bidders long-term investment plans.
One of Warburg's main difficulties will be comparing what are likely to be very differently structured proposals, and independent actuaries and the Department of Trade & Industry will be consulted before a decision is made.
Job security for ScotAm's 2,200 employees is also likely to play its part and all three bidders have been quick to calm fears of job cuts at ScotAm.
AMP has said it would consider moving its Bristol-based London Life buisness to Scotland if it won while both Abbey and the Pru have said job preservation in Stirling would be a priority.
AMP, Abbey and the Pru are all that are left of half a dozen companies, including National Westminster Bank and Lloyds TSB who last month signed confidentiality agreements with ScotAm to evaluate the company as a takeover prospect.
The final price -- widely expected to top two billion pounds ($3.2 billion) -- is said to have deterred many from taking their interest further and Lloyds admitted recently that after running the slide rule over ScotAm, it felt the bid premium looked too high.
Both the Pru and Abbey have already said that their original proposals might be increased once they had access to more detailed financial detail on ScotAm.
Abbey's original bid was worth up to 1.4 billion pounds while the Pru's 1.9 billion pound offer included a loan element to bolster ScotAm's life fund.
Those bids came barely two weeks after ScotAm had published its own proposals to shed its mutual status and float itself on the stock market.
AMP has not yet given any indication of what it might be prepared to pay for ScotAm, but is financially strong has said it was keen to make acquisitions in both the British and U.S. market.

"Mutually-owned life assurance company Scottish Amicable on Friday rebuffed a takeover bid worth up to 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) from British retail banking group Abbey National Plc.
Scottish Amicable said it would pursue its own plan, announced earlier this month, to shed its mutual status and seek a stock market flotation in three to five years time.
""We believe this offer will by very attractive to Scottish Amicable policyholders, providing them with immediate value and the long-term security of being part of one of the UK's strongest financial groups,"" Abbey National chief executive Peter Birch said in a statement.
The Abbey offer, which surprised the market and sent its shares up 6.5 pence to 775.5, includes a minimum of 400 million pounds to policyholders in cash or Abbey shares and an immediate investment into the funds of 1.1 million with-profit policyholders of between 700 million to one billion pounds.
Despite the rejection by Scottish Amicable, the Abbey, Britain's fifth largest bank, said it was still hoping to persuade the life assurer, which has 14 billion pounds under management, to accept the offer and put it to its policy holders.
""We feel that we can offer something much more attractive to the Scottish Amicable policy holders,"" Abbey deputy chief executive Charles Toner told Reuters. ""That's why we really want to talk to Scottish Amicable and we hope still to persuade them to put this more attractive deal to their policy holders.""
Toner said that the ScotAm board had not yet had time to stand back and examine the proposals properly.
""They've been working on their scheme for some time and they probably can't consider anything else in their minds,"" he added. ""In truth, they don't seem to want to discuss it at the moment but we hope that they will. It's early days, there's plenty of time for them to draw breath and talk to us.""
The second element of the offer would see Abbey National invest between 700 million and one billion pounds into the with-profits fund, where the policyholder is entitled to a share of the profits from the growth of the fund.
Scottish Amicable said the approach from Abbey was vague and it was unclear how it was valuing the group. The insurer, based in Stirling, Scotland, said it intends to publish in 10 days time detailed proposals about a twin-phased transformation, involving losing its mutual status on May 1 and a 1.0 billion pound flotation in three to five years time.
""The start of a growth phase is the wrong time in the cycle for policyholders to put their businesss on the market,"" said Sandy Stewart, chairman of Scottish Amicable.
Later, a spokesman for Scottish Amicable's advisers said there was a ""grave danger of policy holders being misled by the vague terms of Abbey National's pronouncements. They have misunderstood Scottish Amicable's proposals.""
The spokesman said the benefits to policy holders of the flotation proposal had been conservatively stated and the actual value would be considerably higher.
Abbey's Toner said the Scottish Amicable business would be an excellent fit for its Scottish Mutual business which it bought in 1992. It has 8.0 billion pounds under management and sells its products through the independent financial adviser (IFA) network.
""We started quite cautiously with Scottish Mutual but now it's growing very strongly under our management but as the whole life sector continues to consolidate, we do think it would be good, with the right partner, to link Scottish Mutual with something else,"" he added.",0
"Stiff competition and severe weather in the U.S. led to a 15 million pound ($24.2 million) fall in 1996 profits from British insurer General Accident Plc on Tuesday, despite a record final quarter.
The weather-related losses knocked 30 million pounds off operating profits which slipped to 421 million pounds over the year.
Echoing recent remarks from rival insurers, chief executive Bob Scott described the market as ""increasingly competitive"", although he was hopeful of a rise in motor premiums in the coming year.
General Accident intends to raise all motor rates, covering about 800,000 vehicles, by around 3.2 percent in April.
That increase will be reviewed in July and Scott said an eight percent rise for the year as a whole was the sort of increase needed given current market conditions.
The big question is whether such rises stick. Last year's four percent April increase resulted in an eventual rise of between two and three percent.
There were, however, no signs of rate increases in the homeowner or commercial sectors, said Scott.
Despite the fall in 1996 profits and even allowing for a 10 million pound boost from a change in the way the group accounts for overseas earnings, the results were at the top end of market expectations.
Year-end net assets per share, up a slightly less-than-expected three percent at 675 pence by year-end, have since risen to 734 pence.
A 10-1/2 percent increase in the dividend for the year to 34.25 pence per share was also ahead of forecast and by late afternoon the shares had added 11 pence to 848 pence.
Analysts welcomed a resilient underwriting performance, especially in the fourth quarter in Britain and the United States, and the level of profitability in new business in the group's life operations.
""There's some justification in adding some goodwill over the net asset value (NAV) into the share price for future profitable new business in life,"" commented one analyst.
The acquisition of Provident Mutual in January 1996 helped fuel a 37 percent increase in life and pension profits over the year to 108 million pounds.
Provident contributed 18 million pounds after reorganisation costs of 16 million pounds and Scott said the group was now looking to capitalise on the pension expertise which Provident had brought.
The key for the life company was the profitability of new business, said Scott, but he ruled out any major acquisitions in the drive to expand the business.
""At the present time there's nothing wrong with organic growth in life. We've proved we're capable of achieving that.""
The group has set itself the goal of increasing the proportion of more stable life earnings to a level which covers dividends each year. In 1996 the proportion of dividend covered by net life earnings in 1996 was 44 percent.
Scott also dismissed speculation of a merger or takeover involving General Accident.
""We've got the benefits of scale in our major businesses. We don't have to do anything. We'd like to make further acquisitions in the U.S. Midwest but don't see any need to dramatically change our current shape,"" said Scott.
Investment income over the year was up seven percent but the rise in stock markets to record levels over 1996 has prompted the company to reduce exposure to British and North American equities over the past three quarters and shift money into bonds. ($ = 0.619 British Pounds)",0
"Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses, confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate, probably belongs to China's strategic state reserve, industry sources said on Friday.
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where some of the strategic stockpile was stored, they said.  
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) in June and July.
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve, administered directly by the central government's State Planning Commission, owned the copper.
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise.  
But one source, the head of a Hong Kong trading house, said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not.
""If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou, it will be sitting there for years,"" he said.
""Once it arrives in Yingkou, it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission, which has to give permission for any more movement; it is out of the hands of traders,"" he said.
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months, with traders unsure not only of who owns it, but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it.  
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange (LME).
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price.
CNIEC lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June 1995 on behalf of the state reserve, running the state stockpile down to 115,000 tonnes from 200,000 tonnes previously.  
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US$2,700 a tonne, and then paid somewhere between $2,200 and $2,400 a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year.
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit, which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs.
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market.  
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the 85,000 tonnes, ""whoever they are, is the most important short-term fundamental"" in an already tight world market.
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp, with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of $1.8 billion in a decade of unauthorised deals.
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement.  
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses. They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases.
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market.
But these concerns were irrelevant, a Singapore trader said, despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year.  
As with many commodities, ""there is a desire (by the Chinese government) to keep a stockpile of the metal,"" he said. ""You don't keep it to help industry, you keep it in case of emergency.""",0
"Chile, the world's biggest copper exporter, hopes to forge close trade and technical support ties with China, the world's biggest copper importer, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mariano Fernandez said.
""There is Chinese interest in participating in some mining projects in Chile, and we have an interest in participating in service and technology in copper mining in China,"" Fernandez told Reuters in a recent interview.
Of Chile's total 1995 mining exports worth US$7.85 billion, $280 million was earned from selling copper to China, he said.
""It is not only potential ... this is reality,"" he said. ""If we look ahead, there are some forecasts that in five years we will produce almost one-third of the world's total copper.
""But looking at 1.2 billion (Chinese) people and the rush for development in China, we should not exclude China as a very important client for Chilean copper.""
Chile, with 25 percent of world copper reserves, mined 2.512 million tonnes of the red metal in 1995, far ahead of its closest rival the United States, with 1.8 million, and fifth placed China with 435,000 tonnes, Chilean figures show.  
Copper accounted for 36.4 percent of Chile's total exports in 1995 of $16.5 billion, the figures show.
China's 1996 demand for copper has been officially put at one million tonnes.
Its copper imports for 1996 were expected to be 200,000 tonnes, the president of China Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corp, Wu Jianchang, said in May.
Trade and industry sources have speculated recently about China's interest in buying copper properties in Chile, along similar lines to recent investment by major Chinese corporations in Peru's iron ore industry.
But one source with a major regional producer said the high price of Chilean copper mines, combined with a cash squeeze in China and the poor international reputation of Chinese buyers, would keep Chilean producers reluctant to forge long-term ties.
""I don't see China guaranteeing long-term supply contracts,"" the industry executive, based in Hong Kong, said.
""It is not the way they work because if the prices fall, they are then very reluctant to pay,"" he said. He was referring to the practice of some Chinese importers of refusing to pay for commodities if the price falls between order and delivery.  
Fernandez did not elaborate on the details of cooperation Chile was hoping for with China. ""We are at the beginning (of discussions),"" he said.
He was in Hong Kong after a four-day trip to Beijing where he met with senior Chinese officials, including Minister for Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen and Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi.
The purpose of his visit was to lay the groundwork for a visit to Chile on November 6 and 7 by Chinese Premier Li Peng, he said.
Fernandez said he asked Chinese officials to consider recognising Chile as free of Mediterranean fruit fly, as Japan had already done, and free of foot-and-mouth disease.
""The Chilean dream is to sell one apple, one bunch of grapes and one bottle of wine a year to every Chinese person,"" he said.",0
"Chinese grain sellers are cutting the price they are willing to accept to export corn but are still a good US$12 a tonne over prevailing world prices, Far East trading sources said on Wednesday.
Chinese corn was being offered at $150 a tonne FOB (free on board), traders in Hong Kong and China said, while U.S. corn is selling into Asian ports at $138 c&f (cost and freight) a tonne.
""There is no point because no one is going to pay that price,"" said a trader in Hong Kong.
He said Chinese sellers could be coming under pressure to move old crop as the new crop -- expected to be a bumper of between 115 million and 120 million tonnes -- comes on stream.
Traders who bought corn earlier in 1996 in the hope of making huge profits had been paying storage costs for more than six months and could now be trying to cut their losses, he said.
An industry source in Beijing said the offers were being made by state-owned traders in Jilin and Heilongjiang, China's major corn-growing provinces in the far northeast.
""At 1,250 (yuan per tonne, or $150) there won't be any takers unless China starts selling forward -- March, April, May -- which would see them possibly being more competitive,"" he said.
Wednesday's March futures price on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was 1,550 yuan ($186) per tonne.
Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) fell in Tuesday trading after the release of official U.S. figures predicting an enormous U.S. corn crop.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the 1996 crop would total 9.265 million bushels, far above previous estimates. The announcement pushed December corn down 1/4 cents to $2.68 and March down 1-1/4 cents to $2.70-1/2.
Asian traders said they expected U.S. corn to fall further in the immediate term, leaving Chinese corn in its dust.
Traders reported last week that China had already given the green light to corn exports -- lifting a ban in effect since December 1994 -- but authorities had set a minimum price of $170 a tonne when the world price was $140-150.
Trading sources said they were receiving offers from provincial branches of Beijing's central food buying arm China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import/Export Corp (COFCO) and some Chinese trading companies with export permits.
The general feeling among traders polled by Reuters was that the price had been set with the intention of stifling exports.
Permission had to come from vice premier and economic tsar Zhu Rongji, who would be loathe to take any steps that could be inflationary, said industry sources who have met with Zhu over the issue.
With U.S. corn prices seen falling -- one Hong Kong trader predicted $130 a tonne c&f Asian ports -- industry sources doubted any Chinese corn would leave home within the next six months.",0
"Casualties are starting to mount as Chinese buyers of soybeans and soybean meal default or cancel contracts in the wake of falling international prices, Asian trading sources said on Thursday.
""We have stopped doing Chinese business for now,"" said a trader in Hong Kong with a major international house.
""We're waiting for the market to stabilise and are staying away from the possibility of defaults,"" he said.
Traders in Hong Kong, Singapore and China reported hearing of Chinese soymeal buyers delaying finance arrangements for orders in an attempt to force sellers to lower their prices.
Another Hong Kong source reported that Chinese buyers had defaulted on three to four cargoes, each of 50,000 tonnes, since last week when international prices began to fall.
""They are defaulting because PRC buyers delayed opening LCs (letters of credit) in the hope of squeezing another two or three dollars from their sellers,"" he said.
Traders have said these tactics are next to useless as physical soymeal for prompt delivery is tight, and would command a premium that would wipe out any extra profit.
Since entering the international trading arena earlier this decade, Chinese traders have earned themselves a reputation for dubious practices when it comes to paying for their orders.
In some cases, traders have reported, a Chinese buyer will default on or cancel an order for a commodity if the price falls after the order is placed and before it is delivered.
The Chinese company will then attempt to replace the commodity at the cheaper rate.
As a result, when prices of a commodity that is a hot item in China begin to fall, some international traders simply exit the market.
Others insist on deposits, and others grade Chinese traders according to their record of paying up and charge higher premiums accordingly.
Soybean meal has been the hot Chinese commodity of 1996, traders said, with arrivals from South America around 1.2 million tonnes since February.
Traders said maximum Chinese orders of U.S. meal in the past two weeks were 300,000 tonnes.
One trader claiming to have done 400,000 tonnes of beans and meal business in the past two weeks said he had letters of credit from his buyers for 350,000 tonnes.
His sales would show up in U.S. Department of Agriculture figures this week, he said.
The price of soybean meal on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has been on a rollercoaster ride since late September, and initially dipped while China was on holiday from September 30 to October 3 celebrating National Day.
On October 4, Chinese buyers scooped up more than 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal, mostly of U.S. origin, some South American, paying $300 to $310 a tonne, traders said.
But last Friday, prices started to fall again, by Tuesday coming off another $10 or so a tonne -- and word of Chinese cancellations and defaults began to circle.
Reports from Chicago on Wednesday described the market as perplexed over rumours China had bought or cancelled export orders for U.S. and South American soybeans and soymeal.
CBOT October soymeal closed at $236.30 a tonne, after Tuesday's $235.30.",0
"China has banned imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states, threatening an export market worth about $500 million a year, because of fears it carries a fowl plague, a U.S. embassy official in Beijing said on Wednesday.
""China has placed a ban on imports of all poultry and poultry products from 10 states,"" the official said.
Chinese authorities had indicated fears the poultry products carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), he said.
The states affected are Arkansas, Florida, Maryland, Utah Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin.
The U.S. embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there seemed to be some confusion on the part of Chinese quarantine officials over the difference between HPAI and avian influenza (AI).
""HPAI has not been found in the U.S. since 1984 and we believe there has been some confusion about the type of AI virus found in the United States and noted by China,"" he said.
A U.S. quarantine official based in China told Reuters last week the virus could not be transmitted to people who ate the meat of infected birds.
China is the second biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and is its only market for chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes transshipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
Every day 30 23-tonne containers of U.S. chicken feet crossed the border from Hong Kong into China, the council's spokeswoman Sarah Li said.
The AI virus could be found worldwide, particularly in wild fowl, the embassy official said, and had not been isolated from commercial poultry flocks in the United States.
Another U.S. official told Reuters the AI virus may have been detected in ostriches imported from the United States as breeding stock on Chinese ostrich farms.
""Ostrich raising in China has become very popular and a lot of the breeding stock is brought in from the U.S.,"" the marketing official said on condition of anonymity.
""We heard that some of the ostrich breeding stock had been found to have AI,"" the official said.
News of the ban surfaced last week and was confirmed by Chinese quarantine officials to the U.S. embassy on Friday.
Officials of China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing met on Tuesday in an effort to resolve the issue, the embassy official said.
""It was a frank, candid and open meeting -- they listened to us and agreed that we should talk more about it, which we will as soon as possible,"" the official said.
""Basically, we said we think there's been a misunderstanding, but they said what if it (the AI virus) mutates? We said it didn't and they rejected that,"" he said.
The rejection threatened U.S. poultry markets in China and had also been extended to poultry and poultry meat imports from the Netherlands for the same reason, he said.
Officials of the U.S. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service would travel from the United States to meet their Chinese counterparts. No date had been fixed.",0
"China is awash with steel and suppliers scrambling for a piece of one of the world's few active markets and keeping prices down while they go about it, traders and industry executives in Asia said on Tuesday. ""The competition is forcing prices down,"" a senior executive with a Western firm said.
Prices had fallen 10 percent and more over the past couple of months, an executive with a Japanese steelmaker said.
Cold-rolled steel was fetching between $400 and $430 a tonne, he said, galvanized steel up to $100 less than that.  
He and other sources repeated reports of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of galvanized steel stacked up at Chinese ports, but these could not be confirmed.
Steel industry figures said China was flooded with cheap steel, much of it from the former Soviet Union, and most gave a pessimistic outlook for the recovery of the Chinese market.
""I can't see the bottom yet,"" the Japanese executive said. ""People have been hoping for a recovery, but I think there is no hope for improvement within this year.""  
Figures published in the official Chinese press in July showed imports of steel billet and rolled steel in the first five months of 1995 at 6.83 million tonnes, up 18.9 percent on the same 1995 period.
Exports of these products were down 31.8 percent, to 2.59 million tonnes, in the January-May period, press reports said.
A flood into Asia of European steel makers fleeing soft markets at home has increased the choice of quality products in China five-fold, the Western source said.  
Steel stockpiles that had been mounting since the phenomenal buying of 1993 -- when 33 million tonnes of steel entered the country -- were slowly being whittled away, traders said.
Total 1994 imports were 22 million tonnes. In 1995, they were 15 million.
Jason Zheng, senior China and regional steel analyst at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong, said he estimated China's steel stockpile at 30 million tonnes.
The quality was unknown but doubtful, he said, and so should not dent China's need for high quality product.  
China would probably import between 12 and 15 million tonnes of steel in 1996, trade and industry sources said.
""What they need is a quality they can't get at home,"" the Western executive said.
Imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States were falling, Zheng said, ""because it is low quality stuff and if you only have 12 to 15 million tonnes of imports, you must have a higher quality product coming in"".
However, industry sources said China's steel market was weak and beset by a lack of cash for buyers -- and a rising incidence of contract washouts.  
""Buyers are not willing to pay for their orders, not just because they don't have the cash, but because the price drops between order and delivery time and they are rejecting the cargoes or asking us to reduce the price,"" the Japanese executive said
A source with another Japanese steelmaker said major Japanese mills had cut their prices by 10 to 15 percent to hold on to their Chinese customers.
""So the obvious trend is that demand is not growing as the Japanese mills had expected and as a result they have a lot of surplus to push onto the market,"" he said.  
""The problem is that even though China's state-owned manufacturers are trying to produce more, they are having problems getting hard currency to buy the raw materials.""
China's annual steel demand was around 95 million tonnes, trading sources said.
China's Ministry of Metallurgical Industry said in July that steel demand would reach an annual 120 million tonnes by 2000.
The Ministry set an annual output target of 130 million tonnes by 2000, and said production would increase by five million tonnes a year between 1996 and 2000.",0
"China is not expected to be in the international market for sugar before mid-1997 as stocks are high and domestic prices are recovering in the lead up to the harvest, traders and Western industry sources said on Wednesday.
But a lack of cash among state-run sugar processors could affect farmers' willingness to keep growing sugar cane and pressure the industry in the long-term, they said.
China had up to two million tonnes of processed sugar in reserve after massive imports in 1995 that have yet to be fully absorbed, a Hong Kong trader said.  
""No one knows the actual figure because it's a state secret,"" he said of China's sugar reserves.
""I would think there is something between one and two million tonnes, because they imported 3.3 million tonnes in 1995 and it takes a long time to use up,"" he said.
China's sugar demand had not increased by very much over the eight million tonnes of recent years, traders said.
""China's economy in 1996 has not been that good, so consumption has not really gone up,"" another Asian trader said.
""Sugar is not an essential item in China and people can go without it when money is tight,"" he said.  
The bulk of the Chinese market is industrial, traders said.
Central authorities are expected to maintain tight control over the sugar industry, encouraged by the success of an ongoing crackdown on smuggling, traders said.
Millions of tonnes of sugar were smuggled into China in 1994 and 1995 on false or altered import licences, flooding the market and pushing ex-factory prices below break-even point.
The crackdown, which was long and severe, brought some control back to the sugar industry, traders said, and prices are finally starting to move up.
No licences had been issued this year, traders said.  
A tonne of processed sugar in major production areas in the southwest of the country is now fetching 4,100 to 4,200 yuan (US$494-$506), up from 3,800 yuan (US$458) a tonne a few months ago, traders and industry executives said.
The head of a Western company with joint venture interests in Guangxi province said this was ""putting a smile on our faces for the first time in months"".
Government-set cane purchasing prices in Guangxi, China's major sugar grower, have not been raised from last season's 250 to 280 yuan ($30-33) a tonne, he said.  
But many state-run sugar processors lacked cash to pay farmers for the cane they grew last season, and had either been late in paying or had handed over IOUs instead, he said.
China News Service, a semi-official agency in Hong Kong, reported in August the Agricultural Bank of China's Guangxi branch had been ordered to lend 400 million yuan ($48 million) to the province's sugar industry to buy 100,000 tonnes of sugar.
Many farmers had already planted cane for the current season when the cash shortages began to bite, but they might be discouraged from planting again if the same happens this year, the Western industry source said.  
China's sugar harvest begins in mid-November and according to the official Xinhua News Agency could climb two million tonnes over 1995's 5.65 million tonnes.
Customs figures released in late September show China's sugar exports in the first eight months of 1996 were up 310.1 percent on the same year-ago period to 462,459 tonnes.
Imports fell 54.9 percent in that time to 830,000 tonnes, the figures show.
China permits raw sugar imports for the purpose of tolling, or processing and re-exporting.

"Genetically-altered soybeans at the centre of an international environmental furore are causing little concern in China, a major soybean importer with its own bio-engineering programmes, industry sources said on Wednesday.
""China is a very public and vocal supporter of our technology,"" said a source at Monsanto Co, the developer of the first genetically-altered U.S. soybeans.
""The Chinese have been heavily involved in their own programmes to produce insect-resistant cotton and genetically-altered soybeans, corn and rice,"" the source in Hong Kong, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Monsanto has been targeted in the United States and now in Europe by environmental groups opposed to genetic engineering.
The soybeans have been developed with a resistance to a widely-used weed killer called Roundup, also a Monsanto product.
""I would think they would be very happy in China to get their hands on some of this product if they are pest-resistant,"" an industry executive in China said.
""They have a lot of their own problems with insects, especially in their soy and corn crops,"" he said.  
The Monsanto source said Chinese research, while a good decade behind his own company's, mirrored Monsanto's efforts at developing pest and insecticide resistant crops.
""So I wouldn't expect there to be any concern in China about this product,"" he said.
He said Monsanto was negotiating for co-operative projects in China, but would not give further details.
Greenpeace and other environmental campaigners were preparing on Tuesday to picket the arrival in Hamburg of a ship believed to be carrying some of the Monsanto soybeans.
Greenpeace activists in Hong Kong, however, said on Wednesday that despite concerns, they had no plan to campaign against the sale of the genetically-altered beans in Asia.
""The problem is we don't know what form it is in -- in powder form, in animal feed, mixed into hamburger meat -- so we have no way of knowing if we are eating it,"" said Clement Chan, spokesman for Greenpeace in Hong Kong.
""The beans have not been extensively tested before being made available to the public so we don't know what we are doing to human or animal bodies,"" he said.
Other than providing information on request, Greenpeace had no plan of action against the beans in Asia, Chan said.  
The beans have been approved for use in Japan, the biggest buyer of U.S. soybean products, the Monsanto source said.
User-groups in other countries, such as the Food and Drink Industry Association of the Netherlands, have also said they will use the genetically-altered U.S. soybeans.
Grain traders and industry executives in Asia said they had received no expression of concern from potential buyers in the region about the altered soybeans and did not expect to.
""They represent a very small proportion of the U.S. crop at this stage,"" a grain trader in Singapore said, adding the beans could account for 10 percent of the total U.S. crop in 1997.
The U.S. soybean crop, now more than 70 percent harvested, is expected to be more than 64 million tonnes, according to the American Soybean Association. Of that, 24.8 million tonnes will go to export markets.
While not among the biggest customers for U.S. soybean products, China is expected to buy around one million tonnes of beans in calendar 1996, and up to two million tonnes of meal.",0
"Falling world metal prices have spooked Asian aluminium traders who said on Monday up to 80,000 tonnes of the metal was sitting in Chinese ports, having been ordered by consumers who now want to pay the lower prices.
""A lot of people have aluminium stuck in China,"" a trader based in Hong Kong with a European firm said.
""There's more than 80,000 tonnes that I know of,"" he said.
Another industry source in Hong Kong said 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of aluminium was stuck in Hong Kong and the nearby south Chinese port of Shantou, having been destined for Chinese end-users who refused to pay for it.
Chinese trading companies have earned poor reputations in recent years for reneging on deals when world prices of the commodity they are buying fall between the date the order was placed and the date of its arrival.
Metal traders in Hong Kong and Beijing said they had been waiting for news of distressed cargoes as they watched prices fall.
Another trading source said figures of up to 80,000 tonnes of distressed aluminium were believable given the amount in Hong Kong and Shantou, as material was also being shipped to other ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin.
""People will stop selling to China until the price goes up again,"" he said. ""And the price won't move up again until the LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks fall. There's just too much there.""
On top of this has been a general slowdown in metals business to China, traders said. None polled by Reuters saw business improving before the end of 1996.
Latest LME figures show aluminium stocks at 961,450 tonnes. The LME's aluminium price has been hitting long-term lows in recent trading weeks.
Prices picked up from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday as news emerged that some Russian smelters were considering cutting production.
LME three-months aluminium ended at US$1,337 a tonne, not much different from Thursday but firmer than before the news and somewhat above a low hit on Thursday of $1,305.
A year ago, the price was $1,742.
""Some people are forecasting the price will move to $1,250,"" another Hong Kong trader said. But he added: ""There is good support at the $1,300 level.""
LME warehouses in Singapore had plenty of metal, he said, but it was commanding a premium over the LME cash price of $30 to $40, and ocean freight rates to China were $65 a tonne.
""This is the main problem -- no trader can afford it. No one can afford it,"" he said.
Chinese consumers were mostly buying hand-to-mouth, waiting for prices to reach rock-bottom, traders said.
""Once the price starts to move up again they will buy, because they will see the bottom has been hit,"" the European trader said.
Traders said world metals markets would probably spend the fourth quarter of 1996 defining a direction for 1997, when fundamentals should begin to play a role in firming the price.

"Some Chinese traders are moving to take advantage of a sharp rally in world copper prices by selling the red metal back to the market, Far East metal industry sources said on Wednesday.
A rise in copper stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore was attributed in part by some trading sources to Chinese selling.
""With such high LME prices, I believe some (copper) will be brought out of China,"" a Singapore trader said.  
He said stocks in Singapore rose 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes late last week -- after hovering at extremely low levels for the past couple of months -- as Chinese buyers sold material recently taken from LME warehouses elsewhere.
Asian traders have said China is adding substantial tonnages -- up to 300,000 tonnes -- to its central stockpile, with a third of that amount now passing through customs in Shanghai.
These reports have helped fuel a rally in three-month LME copper, which has climbed almost 20 percent in recent weeks on tight physical supply.  
Three-month LME metal hit a five-month high of $2,232 a tonne on Tuesday, up from $1,900 at the end of October.
Whether or not the copper now in China has completed customs formalities is not an issue, sources said.
""This is the government, they do what they like,"" said one.
There was a feeling, however, that Chinese government departments, mired in bureaucratic red tape, would be unable to move fast enough to take advantage of rapid market movements.
This would be the province of minor trading companies using hot money to buy small lots for speculative purposes.  
At least one Asian trader reported small parcel offerings from Chinese companies wanting to pick up between $200-$300 a tonne in profit.
Prices are at their highest since June 14 when Japan's Sumitomo Corp announced that one of its copper traders had wracked up losses in unauthorised deals now said by the company to be US$2.6 billion.
Reports from Europe last week of a hidden hoard of 600,000 tonnes of copper in Rotterdam were shot down by Asian traders.  
Tight global supply is now driving prices, with LME copper stocks below 100,000 tonnes for the first time since 1990 and representing less than a month's demand.
Traders in the Far East, polled in recent days, told Reuters this fundamental shift in the world supply/demand picture should keep prices buoyed at least in the short term.
""It's a volatile market and it is impossible to know what is going to happen,"" a South American source said.
""Is it going to stay over $1/lb next year? Absolutely, I have no doubt about that. It won't be for a couple of days, I'm talking for maybe a quarter and I think it will then stay there.  
""Why? Consumption. Don't forget consumption. It is much more important than people think. The fundamentals really call for a higher price,"" he said.
Shanghai and surrounding areas alone use upwards of 45,000 tonnes of copper a month, a European source in Hong Kong said.
But physical copper on the Shanghai Metal Exchange has also been tight as traders there liquidate their positions on the rising LME prices.
""Prices have gone up so fast it is a little bit hard to digest,"" a trader in Shanghai said.
""It could be beneficial to export,"" she said.  
""On the other hand, anyone who wanted to buy could be afraid the price will start to go the other way. It's close to year-end, book-squaring time, so everyone will want to sit back and wait.""

"Talks aimed at averting a Chinese ban on imports of United States poultry have been hailed as a success by U.S. officials, who said on Friday they expected the issue to vanish without any disruption to a major market.
A Chinese ban on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states, worth nearly US$500 million a year, was now unlikely to be implemented, official U.S. sources said.
""I'm optimistic that the issue has been resolved,"" a U.S. diplomat in Beijing said by telephone.
""Hopefully, this thing will now be dropped. I'm not expecting any correspondence or a list -- sometimes no news is good news,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A two-man team from Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) spent two days in meetings with China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) and scientists from other government departments and universities.
The aim of the talks was to convince CAPQ that U.S. poultry does not carry a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), contrary to Chinese fears that led to the ban.
""We are hopeful this issue has been resolved,"" said Ray Miyamoto, the APHIS area director in Beijing. ""We feel their (CAPQ's) primary concerns were adequately addressed.""
Miyamoto added that CAPQ planned to write a report that may or may not be made available to APHIS.
The meetings ended on Thursday. CAPQ was not immediately available for comment.
U.S. sources described the talks as ""frank, open and candid"" and said they augured well for other discussions slated for November on plant quarantine issues.
Wheat, however, remains shrouded in politics. Washington claims a Chinese ban on accepting wheat from specific U.S. areas because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut is, in effect, a non-tariff trade barrier.
A top-level Chinese delegation is due to leave for the United States this weekend for a two-week TCK fact-finding trip.
The poultry ban came to light on October 10 after U.S. chicken meat imports were blocked. CAPQ confirmed it to U.S. Embassy officials in Beijing the next day in a telephone call.
Nothing was ever received in writing from CAPQ, a source at the embassy said on Friday, and the ban was not implemented as CAPQ wanted first to hear what the U.S. experts had to say.
What the experts said, according to sources close to the meetings, was that HPAI, while widespread in wildfowl, was eradicated from commercial U.S. flocks in the mid-1980s.
The U.S. side seemed convinced that CAPQ had confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which an APHIS source likened to the common cold.
Another U.S. source said the Chinese fears had been fuelled during a visit to Texas by CAPQ personnel to check on ostrich breeding stock destined for farms in southern China.
A number of birds there tested positive for HPAI, the source said, though this did not necessarily mean they were afflicted with the virus.
China is the second-biggest market in the world, after Russia, for U.S. poultry products and its only market for chicken feet.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The council's representative in Hong Kong, Sarah Li, told Reuters about 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet are transported across the border from Hong Kong into China every day.",0
"Chinese and U.S. scientists are making good progress in meetings on China's decision to ban poultry imports from the United States, a U.S. source said on Thursday.
The Chinese government banned all imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states earlier this month for fear it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
Although the ban has yet to be implemented -- China wanted to hear what the U.S. experts had to say first -- it threatens an export market worth around US$500 million a year.
""The first set of meetings on Wednesday were frank, candid and held in a positive atmosphere,"" the source, who refused to be identified, said by telephone from Beijing.
The meetings are between Washington's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ).
Two APHIS experts arrived in Beijing on Tuesday night and would stay in Beijing for as long as it took to solve the problem, the U.S. source said.
""There is no timetable,"" the source close to the talks said. ""We are willing to take as much time as is needed in order to make sure the Chinese have as much information as they can to make an informed decision based on good science.""
Meetings had already been scheduled for Thursday and would, if necessary, continue on Friday, he added.
APHIS experts, U.S. diplomats and meat industry executives say HPAI does not exist in commerical flocks in the United States, having been eradicated in the mid-1980s.
U.S. sources have said Chinese quarantine officials seem to have confused HPAI with the less-virulent avian influenza, or AI, which one APHIS source likened to the common cold.
Sources have said CAPQ officials would be joined by experts from other government departments for what sounded like a series of lectures and presentations by the APHIS team.
The U.S. source in Beijing said the Chinese had so far been receptive and were taking a ""very positive approach"".
U.S. sources said the plan was to concentrate initially on the technical side of the dispute before raising trade issues.
If the dispute goes beyond the differences the two countries have in interpreting science, Beijing could find itself accused of using bad science as a non-tariff trade barrier.
This is the case with wheat. China refuses to import wheat from specific areas of the United States because it cannot be guaranteed free of a fungus called TCK smut.
Washington says the fungus is harmless and that Beijing's policy of zero tolerance is a barrier to an extra 500,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat sales a year to China.",0
"Wheat is unlikely to become a casualty of the row between Beijing and Washington over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan since higher grain production in China is slashing the need for imports, traders said on Tuesday.
""As far as we see business, we could well not have anything with China for the rest of this year,"" a U.S. trader said.
""The (Chinese) domestic crop looks good, they have cancelled a lot of orders already. Canada has enough to hold China if they do need to get into the market,"" she said.
China's 1996/97 wheat production is expected to hit a record 107 million tonnes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said earlier this month, raising its estimate from 104 million tonnes.
As a result, total imports were also revised downward by one million tonnes to eight million tonnes.
A new war of words broke out between Beijing and Washington this month after the Pentagon said Taiwan wanted to buy missiles and other weaponry worth around US$420 million.
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since Nationalists fled there after losing the civil war in 1949. It opposes the sale of weapons to the island.
China has demanded the United States cancel plans for these latest arms sales to prevent ""new damage"" to bilateral ties.
Sino-U.S. ties have see-sawed in recent years over disputes ranging from human rights abuses and widespread copyright piracy in China to alleged nuclear proliferation by Beijing.
Ties had been slowly recovering after reaching a nadir in June 1995 with a U.S. visit by Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui.
China had cancelled around 1.4 million tonnes of wheat orders from the United States since early June, the USDA said.
While some trading sources have speculated that the cancellations could be in retaliation for stalled bilateral negotiations over a fungus called tilletia controversa kuhn, or TCK smut, others put them down to the good Chinese crop outlook.
China is expected, however, to maintain its traditonal level of wheat imports from Canada of around five million tonnes a year. Canadian trade sources have said China's buying programme has already begun.
None of this has deterred U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman from his optimism that China will remain a committed buyer of U.S. wheat.
""I think the key issue myself with China is supplies in China,"" Glickman said in Chicago on Monday.
China imported 11.59 million tonnes of wheat in 1995, up 58.7 percent from the 7.3 million tonnes the year before.",0
"China's decision to ban imports of some U.S. chicken meat due to concerns about a fowl plague could hit a multi-million dollar export business, although U.S. officials said Friday American chickens do not have the disease.
""We don't have highly pathogenic avian influenza (A.I.) in the U.S.,"" a U.S. quarantine official told Reuters. ""There is no record of it being found in domestic poultry,"" he said, adding that the disease had been eradicated after an outbreak in the 1980s.
""It affects the birds but not the meat. The meat does not transmit anything to people,"" the official said.
Washington's agriculture attache in Beijing notified his head office on Thursday that China had blocked imports of chicken meat from 10 U.S. states because of concerns about highly pathogenic avian influenza.
U.S. sources in Beijing said China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine, or CAPQ, had confirmed the ban by telephone on Friday and was preparing notification, which was expected some time next week.
""We initially heard about a ban on the import of poultry chicks, but no one at CAPQ has been able to confirm or deny that,"" a senior diplomatic source said.
""Now, if poultry chicks aren't banned for reasons of A.I., why is poultry meat banned? It makes no sense,"" he said.
Asked to confirm reports of the block on chicken imports, a quarantine official in Beijing told Reuters by telephone: ""It is true."" He declined to give details.
However, Customs officials said they were unaware of the ban.
U.S. officials in Beijing said any ban China might place on U.S. chicken meat imports because of avian influenza was not based on sound scientific evidence. ""It comes down to good science versus bad science,"" one senior official said.
The ban could have a major impact on U.S. poultry exports to China. In 1995, 330,000 metric tons worth $445 million was trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council. China is the second-largest market for U.S. poultry products after Russia, the council's Hong Kong director, Sarah Li, said.
""It is the only market to take paws,"" she said, referring to chicken feet. ""People say U.S. chickens need wheelchairs because all their feet are going to China.""
The Chinese chicken ban is the latest headache for U.S. agriculture officials in China. Wheat is a continuing issue, with China refusing to import grain from the Pacific northwest because it cannot be guaranteed to be free of a fungus called TCK smut.
Washington claims the fungus is harmless, that the ban is not based on good science, that it cuts annual U.S. wheat sales to China by 500,000 tons and is a non-tariff trade barrier. China, on the other hand, says TCK smut could cut domestic wheat yields if it got into the domestic growing areas.",0

Washington's agriculture attache in Beijing confirmed by fax to his head office on Thursday that China had blocked imports of chicken meat from 10 U.S. states because of concerns about highly pathogenic avian influenza.
U.S. sources in Beijing said nothing had been received in writing about the ban from China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ).
""It came out of the blue,"" a senior diplomatic source said.
Embassy officials hoped to meet Ministry of Agriculture officials on Friday or Monday, an embassy source said.
Asked to confirm reports of the block on chicken imports, a quarantine official in Beijing told Reuters by telephone: ""It is true."" He declined to give details.
Officials of the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation (Ceroils) said they had heard of the ban but also declined to give further information.
Customs officials said they were unaware of the ban.
The ban could have a major effect on U.S. poultry exports to China, which in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, and worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
China is the second largest market for U.S. poultry products after Russia, the council's Hong Kong director Sarah Li said.
""It is the only market to take paws,"" she said, referring to chicken feet. ""People say U.S. chickens need wheelchairs because all their feet are going to China.""
Thirty containers a day of chicken feet moved from Hong Kong into China, she said. Any hold-ups would cost importers dearly because of the high cost of storage in Hong Kong.
U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) official John Reddington told a meeting of U.S. poultry producers on Thursday the industry should diversify its export markets as it was vulnerable to changes in sanitary rules such as one that halted shipments to Russia earlier this year.
The drop in prices following the changes in Russia could have put some U.S. producers out of business had it continued, he said.
The Chinese chicken ban is the latest headache for U.S. agriculture officials in China who have been dealing with fears of importing potentially tainted products for over 20 years.
Wheat is an on-going issue, with China refusing to import the grain from the U.S. Pacific northwest because it cannot be guaranteed to be free of a fungus called TCK smut.
Washington claims the fungus is harmless, that the ban is not based on good science, that it cuts annual U.S. wheat sales to China by 500,000 tonnes and is a non-tariff trade barrier.
China, on the other hand, says TCK smut could cut domestic wheat yields if it got into the domestic growing areas.
U.S. officials on Friday said any ban that China might place on U.S. chicken meat imports because of avian influenza was not based on sound scientific evidence.
""It comes down to good science versus bad science,"" a senior official said on condition of anonymity.
Poultry meat was not a likely vehicle for transmission of the virus, he said, and U.S. poultry meat exports posed no threat to the international poultry industry.",0
"U.S. officials are confident a China visit by senior agricultural experts will break an impasse that threatens a multi-million dollar Chinese market for U.S. poultry products, a U.S. agriculture official said on Tuesday.
""Things are looking good,"" the official in Beijing told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""I would say we have all the evidence we think we need to convince them (the Chinese) there is no problem,"" he said.
Two senior U.S. agriculture officials would arrive in Beijing from Washington on Tuesday evening for meetings with Chinese quarantine and agriculture officials, he said.
The talks starting on Wednesday afternoon would focus on a ban China slapped on imports of poultry and poultry products from 10 U.S. states because of fears they carry a fowl plague known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
China's ban came to light on October 10 but has not yet been implemented as, U.S. sources said, Chinese officials decided to wait and hear first what the U.S. experts had to say.
The talks would initially centre on the technical and scientific aspects of the dispute, the Beijing source said.  
""We're trying to keep it that way so the trade issue does not come into it until the technical side has been presented,"" he said.
It would become a trade issue if the Chinese side did not accept U.S. scientific evidence ""and if we feel they'll enforce a ban that has no technical or scientific basis,"" he said.
The U.S. side viewed as a favourable sign China's recent approval of two bovine semen centres and nine embryo transfer centres to import U.S. veterinarian technology, he said.
Bilateral meetings were also set for November on plant health, covering fruit imports, and on the long-simmering issue of wheat imports and a wheat fungus called TCK smut.
""And the secretary of state (Warren Christopher) is coming in November, so all of this is helping us negotiate better,"" the source said.
U.S. diplomats, agriculture officials and meat industry executives say HPAI does not exist in commercial U.S. flocks, having been eradicated in the mid-1980s.
They say China's Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine (CAPQ) is confused about the difference between HPAI and avian influenza, or AI, which one source equated with the common cold.  
The HPAI virus was apparently detected in ostrich breeding stock in Texas destined for ostrich farms in China, and which were being inspected by CAPQ personnel.
Detection of the virus did not mean the bird was diseased, said a U.S. diplomat, likening it to a tuberculosis skin test.
The dispute threatens the United States' second biggest market after Russia for poultry and poultry products, and its only market for chicken feet, considered a delicacy in China.
U.S. poultry exports to China in 1995 totalled 330,000 tonnes trans-shipped through Hong Kong alone, worth US$445 million, according to the U.S. Poultry and Egg Export Council.
The council's representative in Hong Kong, Sarah Li, told Reuters that every day about 700 tonnes of U.S. chicken feet cross the border from Hong Kong into China.",0
"Casualties are starting to mount as Chinese buyers of soybeans and soybean meal default or cancel contracts in the wake of falling international prices, Asian trading sources said on Thursday.
""We have stopped doing Chinese business for now,"" said a trader in Hong Kong with a major international house.
""We're waiting for the market to stabilise and are staying away from the possibility of defaults,"" he said.
Traders in Hong Kong, Singapore and China reported hearing of Chinese soymeal buyers delaying finance arrangements for orders in an attempt to force sellers to lower their prices.
Another Hong Kong source reported that Chinese buyers had defaulted on three to four cargoes, each of 50,000 tonnes, since last week when international prices began to fall.
""They are defaulting because PRC buyers delayed opening LCs (letters of credit) in the hope of squeezing another two or three dollars from their sellers,"" he said.
Traders have said these tactics are next to useless as physical soymeal for prompt delivery is tight, and would command a premium that would wipe out any extra profit.
Since entering the international trading arena earlier this decade, Chinese traders have earned themselves a reputation for dubious practices when it comes to paying for their orders.
In some cases, traders have reported, a Chinese buyer will default on or cancel an order for a commodity if the price falls after the order is placed and before it is delivered.
The Chinese company will then attempt to replace the commodity at the cheaper rate.
As a result, when prices of a commodity that is a hot item in China begin to fall, some international traders simply exit the market.
Others insist on deposits, and others grade Chinese traders according to their record of paying up and charge higher premiums accordingly.
Soybean meal has been the hot Chinese commodity of 1996, traders said, with arrivals from South America around 1.2 million tonnes since February.
Traders said maximum Chinese orders of U.S. meal in the past two weeks were 300,000 tonnes.
One trader claiming to have done 400,000 tonnes of beans and meal business in the past two weeks said he had letters of credit from his buyers for 350,000 tonnes.
His sales would show up in U.S. Department of Agriculture figures this week, he said.
The price of soybean meal on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has been on a rollercoaster ride since late September, and initially dipped while China was on holiday from September 30 to October 3 celebrating National Day.
On October 4, Chinese buyers scooped up more than 600,000 tonnes of beans and meal, mostly of U.S. origin, some South American, paying $300 to $310 a tonne, traders said.
But last Friday, prices started to fall again, by Tuesday coming off another $10 or so a tonne -- and word of Chinese cancellations and defaults began to circle.
Reports from Chicago on Wednesday described the market as perplexed over rumours China had bought or cancelled export orders for U.S. and Latin American soybeans and soymeal.
CBOT October soymeal closed at $236.30 a tonne, after Tuesday's $235.30.",0
"International copper prices are likely to stick to the high road for some time yet, pricing the metal out of the key China market, Far East metal traders said on Monday.
""The LME (London Metal Exchange) will move higher and will test US$2,100 (a tonne),"" a base metal trader in Hong Kong said.
""We want it to go down. $1,800 to $1,900 is workable.""
Copper prices on the LME rallied through the psychological barrier of US$2,000 a tonne on Friday, hitting $2,027 in late afternoon trading.
This rally pushed the international price above the domestic Chinese price, rendering imports senseless, traders said.
On the Shanghai Metal Exchange, the most active February 1997 contract opened at 19,550 yuan ($2,355) a tonne, consolidating around that level within the first half-hour.
China levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax (VAT) on copper imports, killing margins at current prices, traders said.
Soggy Chinese business would be further dampened, traders said. One source at a Chinese listed company said he had 200 tonnes of the red metal to sell at a premium of $100 over the LME spot price.
The premium on copper, CIF (cost, insurance and freight) to Hong Kong and Chinese ports, was $150 last week, traders said.
""We will not have any import business (with China) with such high LME prices,"" another trader in Hong Kong said. ""We are getting calls from Chinese offering copper back to the market.""
""Premiums are not the issue, the total price is the concern -- and even with no premium it is difficult,"" he said.
Among the bears, the head of a trading house in Hong Kong bullishly noted signs the central government was attempting to stimulate the property market could see copper and aluminium users stocking up.
Cancellation of interest rate subsidies, interest rate reductions and the removal of private car purchase quotas were aimed at stimulating the sluggish economy, he said.
""I think the whole picture will change,"" he said.
""We have been waiting for a very long time and we have known they (Chinese authorities) are moving in this direction. It will restart cash flow and that will re-stimulate the economy very, very quickly,"" he said.
He and other traders said Chinese consumers' stocks, usually kept at one month's supply or around 100,000 tonnes, have been run down.
""Consumers have nothing and if they have to accumulate investory in their warehouses because of the change of sentiment, the damage to the market will disappear,"" he said.
Other sources said the Shanghai Metal Exchange had around 15,000 tonnes of copper in stock.
Drawdowns from LME warehouse stocks over the past couple of months indicated demand in Europe was picking up, traders said.
""If it continues, we will not have enough material, especially as there is no scrap around at the moment and LME stocks are down (to 145,825 tonnes),"" said the trading house boss.
""The situation could become critical by the end of the year,"" he said.",0
"Copper stored in Shanghai warehouses -- the murky ownership of which has cast a pall of concern over the world market -- is being offered in small lots to European trading houses, industry sources said on Thursday.
The copper is been offered for sale at a high premium in order to set a benchmark price for its eventual sale to China's strategic stockpile, one Chinese trader said.
Traders said that estimates of copper reserves brought into China in recent months range between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes. A European trader in Beijing said he had been offered copper by the China National Non-ferrous Metals Import and Export Corp (CNIEC) at around $2,100 a tonne -- a level reflecting the London Metal Exchange (LME) cash price plus a premium of $130.
CNIEC has declined to comment on the market talk.
The copper was said to be owned by Chinese trading firms which had shipped it to Shanghai in the expectation that the central stockpile would buy this amount to square its position on metal previously lent to the market, before the end of 1996. ""They are hoping that it is the right tonnage in the right place, but as far as we know, the stockpile has so far not confirmed they will buy it,"" a Chinese trader with a state-owned Chinese firm, said.
Traders said last week the copper probably belonged to China's state reserve, which lent around 85,000 tonnes of copper, through CNIEC, onto the LME between April and June 1995.
In March this year, CNIEC's former president Fang Dachang said China was likely to take it back in the fourth quarter.
But when copper began to move back to China in June and July, from LME warehouses in Rotterdam, Singapore and Long Beach, California traders assumed the central reserve was taking the copper back earlier than planned.
Not so, said the Chinese trader, though he added: ""Who owns it is anyone's guess.""
The metal was taken from LME warehouses at about $2,400 a tonne, a Hong Kong trader said, with the price set before three month LME copper prices slid below $1,800 on news in June of $1.8 billion in copper trading losses by Japan's Sumitomo Corp.
Three month copper was indicated at $1,942/45 a tonne in late LME trade on Wednesday.
""It (the copper) has been sitting there for a couple of months, so someone has to pick up the loss,"" a trader said.
""Whether the stockpile takes this tonnage from this owner, or if they buy it themselves and arrange another shipment themselves, is up to them,"" the Chinese trader said.
""But it depends on the price. If they (the stockpile) can get a premium lower than $100, maybe they will take it. They won't pay $150, or $120, especially on this sort of tonnage.""
A trader in Shanghai said CNIEC would ""dearly love someone to take the whole lot, but that is unrealistic"".
But the Chinese source said: ""This copper can only be taken by the stockpile"" because no other buyer could afford it.
China levies a three percent import duty and a 17 percent value-added tax on copper imports, which traders said made it prohibitively expensive.
Freight, warehousing and other costs would put the Shanghai copper in the same cost bracket as copper shipped to the region from LME warehouses in Europe or the Americas if the premiums being asked were paid, traders said.
Other traders, in Asia and in Europe, have told Reuters that CNIEC had offered them copper in a series of secret meetings held in major Chinese cities since June.
About 40,000 tonnes was said by traders in China to have been shipped already to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou, where the strategic stockpile has some warehouses. This has not been confirmed.
Another 20,000 tonnes of copper was stored in Shanghai Metal Exchange warehouses in the eastern port city, and the remainder of the metal was in other Shanghai stores, traders said.
""The whole market is still being manipulated by somebody,"" a Chinese source said. ""The game is not over.""",0
"Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of copper have moved through Chinese customs into central stocks and are staying put, despite fears the metal could be sold to take advantage of current high prices, traders said on Monday.
""It was a good decision to buy good quality metal at 85 to 90 (U.S.) cents a pound; now they are feeling smug,"" a South American industry executive said of China's central authorities.
""It is central buying, there is no doubt about that because none of it is moving out,"" he said.
China recently boosted central copper reserves by 300,000 tonnes, with most of it now having cleared customs formalities, although a lag in Chinese customs reporting may keep the figures off the books for a couple of months, trading sources said.
Few Chinese trading companies would have the financial resources to buy and then store substantial amounts of copper, a Shanghai trader said.
The recent surge in world spot prices had been expected to fuel a flow of Chinese material on to the world market.
But a modest rise last week in stocks held in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses in Singapore -- traders said about 3,000 tonnes -- indicated the Chinese material was staying home.
""It's a piddling amount,"" a trader in Hong Kong said of the increase in stocks in Singapore.
LME copper trading has been volatile in recent weeks, with a moderate rise in stocks on Friday, the first since early September, pushing prices down on profit-taking and liquidation.
Three months copper finished Friday at US$2,242, bouncing off support around $2,220 in the afternoon ring, dealers said.
Losses were kept to a minimum, they said, as market jitters centred on the upcoming December options declaration. The main concern was if December copper came close to $2,600, where there was a large concentration of open interest on calls.
With LME stocks at 92,475 tonnes and the spot price at 2,470.50, the LME does not have enough copper to cover calls with a strike price of $2,600, which total 168,750 tonnes.
Traders in Asia seemed largely uninterested in the Wednesday options expiry as China is seen to be flush with copper and not interested in selling.
What little movement there has been out of China, some of which was possibly included in the 3,000-tonne hike in Singapore, was in small lots of probably no more than 1,000 tonnes at a time, the Shanghai trader said.
While China was neither actively buying nor selling now, it would have to boost imports to keep pace with demand next year, traders said.
""The market is physically tight so it is very good for the producers,"" a marketing executive with a major producer said.
He said China's crackdown on scrap imports, coupled with expected casualties among domestic smelters, would lead to total Chinese copper imports in 1997 of 830,000 tonnes.
The opening in February or March of a new smelter in Anhui province near the top-of-the-line Tongling smelter would account for an increase over 1996, he said.
Official customs figures show January to October 1996 imports of cast and unwrought copper were up 28.8 percent on 1995, to 549,571 tonnes, with October imports 82,655 tonnes.
The new smelter, a joint venture between Tongling and Japan's Itochu Corp and Sumitomo Corp had already booked 210,000 tonnes of concentrate imports for the year, the marketing executive said.
""They are looking at smelting 330,000 tonnes of concentrate, and producing 110,000 tonnes of metal,"" he said.
In other base metal markets, premiums to Hong Kong remained largely unchanged. The latest Hong Kong indications of premium or discount in US$/tonne over LME cash prices on a CIF basis:

"Anglo-U.S. autocomponents giant LucasVarity unveiled a major corporate shake-up on Tuesday planning 13 non-core disposals and a speeded-up rationalisation which will axe 3,000 jobs worldwide over two years.
LucasVarity, created by a merger earlier this year of Britain's Lucas Industries and Varity Corp of the U.S., said it had identified a range of additional restructuring plans that meant it now saw operating savings of 120 million pounds ($200.2 million) -- double the level anticipated after the merger.
The market initially welcomed the news and the company's shares jumped to a new 12-month high of 263 pence. But downbeat company comments about the auto industry during a telephone conference call to analysts sent the stock slumping to close a sharp 16.5 pence lower at 234p.
""They said that things were relatively tough in France and in the heavy truck market, particularly in Europe, and that they weren't immune to the trends we are seeing in the (competitive) market,"" said one analyst, who declined to be named.
LucasVarity expects to take an extra one-off charge of 130 million pounds, mainly in non-cash items, which will be levied along with 120 million pounds of costs already planned for current year accounts.
Worldwide headcount will be cut by 3,000 over the next two years as a result of the moves, the company said.
Thirteen companies have been marked up for sale after the three-month review which came in the wake of the multi-billion pounds merger between Britain's Lucas Industries and Varity Corp of the U.S. which became effective in September this year.
Commenting on the speed of disposals, Victor Rice, chief executive, told Reuters the group was ""sifting through some offers"" and expected to be in ""active negotiations"" on the sale of some of the 13 quite soon.
Only eight of the 13 businesses marked for sale were named in the restructuring statement released earlier. Rice said that major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five.
The eight named so far are small niche businesses and include starter and alternator firms in Britain, Argentina and South Africa. The 13 disposal targets have combined sales of 270 million pounds.
The criteria for divestment were those firms which ""neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value,"" said Rice.
Commenting on the rationalisation moves, Rice, who came from the Varity side of the merger, said ""the combination of cost savings and anticipated revenue growth identified by these teams will help the company achieve the aggressive performance targets it has set for itself.""
He said the post-demerger savings were ""virtually double"" original expectations. The process of cost cutting would continue he added, concluding that he was ""pretty excited for the future"" of the merged business.
LucasVarity is involved in the design, manufacture and supply of systems, products and services in international automotive, diesel engine, aftermarket and aerospace industries.",0
"UK leisure group Conrad Plc is seen sealing its proposed takeover of Sheffield United Football Club in three to four weeks, when details will be sent to shareholders after due diligence is complete, a senior source close to the company told Reuters.
Conrad confirmed earlier on Tuesday it was in talks with the UK soccer club about the acquisition which is expected to take the form of a reversed takeover with Sheffield floating on the London Stock Exchange. The source said: ""Conrad will pay a figure approaching 10 million, but it'll be under 10 million.""",0
"British building group AMEC Plc said on Friday it was exploring a possible investment in France's Spie Batignolle's electrical and construction businesses with the aim of widening its international exposure.
AMEC said it had been in talks with Spie management about taking an unquantified minority stake which could be raised to a majority stake from the current parent group Schneider SA.
If clinched, the deal would create a major European player with around five billion pounds ($7.9 billion) in sales, with 40 percent exposure in Britain, 30 percent in France and the rest worldwide.
Peter Mason, AMEC's chief executive, told Reuters: ""One important concept is that there is little overlap between the two groups.""
He admitted that AMEC's possible greater exposure to France came as the market was suffering from very tough conditions but he said that AMEC was ""buying at the bottom, not at the top"" and foresaw a turnaround.
The new deal could act as a springboard for AMEC into new markets including oil and gas and pharmaceuticals and new regions including Indonesia, Latin America and South Africa, Mason said.
At present 70 percent of its sales are in Britain.
Mason told Reuters that the two parties were at the due diligence stage and expected more details by November, with completion in December.
The initial stake will be funded from AMEC's existing cash reserves and will give it access to Spie's international network of regional bases offering partnership opportunities on a cost-efficient basis.
The decision to raise the stake to a majority holding would be taken in ""a number of years' time and I'm not talking one or two years"".
AMEC and Spie management envisage a possible flotation of the French operation.
""There will be negotiations between the management and us on how much we will retain and what to float. It will also depend on the state of the (stock) market at the time,"" the AMEC chief said.
""I have been most impressed with Spie's management team and the progress they have made in revitalising Spie,"" he added.",0
"Millennium Chemicals, to be spun off from the mighty Hanson conglomerate in an October flotation, has already had to rebuff would-be suitors, chief executive of the soon-to-be independent company said on Tuesday.
William Landuyt, who is also chairman of Millennium, also unveiled his strategic blueprint in an interview with Reuters, including plans for a share buyback by 2000 after cutting debt and implementing post-demerger investment plans.
Millennium had 1995 sales of two billion pounds ($3.12 billion) and profits of 588 million pounds.
""We are not a dividend yield stock. We are a growth company,"" Landuyt said, warning investors of a tight dividend policy.
The demerger of Hanson Plc will create four companies - Millennium, Imperial Tobacco, Energy Group and the rump building firm which will retain the famous Hanson name.
As investors await details of the float of the first two divisions - Millennium and Imperial - Landuyt said there had been takeover interest in all four companies including his own empire.
""We've had interest for every business in Hanson."" He said ""expressions of interest"" included those for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated off.
Millennium itself received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco. All approaches were rebuffed.
Hanson's chemicals arm had been widely tipped as a takeover candidate by analysts in recent months, but Hanson's group share price recently took a hit after it was revealed that Millennium had built in a ""poison pill"" to deter predators.
The move led to a downgrading in the Hanson break-up value by analysts including BZW which pared back to 193 from 207 pence per share. The market valuation range spreads from 150 pence to 200 pence per share. Hanson's shares stand at 162 1/4, up 2 3/4 pence.
One analyst said of the poison pill episode ""It was quite disgusting. Here is a predatory company which has spoken out against such tactics and has installed a poison pill itself.""
But Landuyt said it was vital to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid.
""We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months. We don't want a temporary drop in the share price to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value.""
Under law in the U.S. state of Delaware, a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first.
But the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid.
Another factor which has damped Millennium's core valuation has been poor trading which has dogged the chemicals market leading to plant closures and asset writedowns of $60 million at SCM. Landuyt said that a further $15 million charge still had to be levied.
He said the impact on trading profits would be neutral and also said signs of an uptick remain.
He expected SCM to be able to make its October price increases stick after heavy destocking by customers.
Quantum's recently reported improvement in pricing and demand also continues, he said.",0
"Debt-laden Eurotunnel faced fresh financial pressure on Wednesday in the wake of the fire which swept through a main tunnel leaving a trail of damage, no running services and shaken consumer confidence.
Just one month after coming back from the brink of bankruptcy with a restructuring of nine billion pounds ($15 billion) of debt, the company faced uncertainy once again as one of its two rail tunnels remained shut pending a safety review.
Analysts said the modest fall in Eurotunnel shares since Monday's fire was about right, however, and few believed there would be long-term damage to customer confidence.
Eurotunnel has warned of reduced services for weeks ahead as repair work goes ahead and eats into revenues.
And one source close to Eurotunnel told Reuters that the cost of repairs may be heavier than first thought. ""The cost will be millions (of pounds) and could get into double figures, it you consider the damage to the 15 wagons and a locomotive, plus severe tunnel damage.""
He added that track sections may also need replacing after buckling in the intense heat.
While the tunnel remains shut, Eurotunnel is losing revenues at the rate of one million pounds a day. It also faces the cost of compensating passengers and tranferring them by air or ferry.
A Eurotunnel spokesman said all these costs should be covered by insurance, however.
""It will have very little impact,"" said one analyst. ""Transport disasters are always newsworthy but the bad publicity will soon fade away. Eurotunnel will be financially damaged, but you have to look at it in relation to the nine billion of debt.""
The ferries have been scooping up extra business from big freight customers like TNT, which said it would be using the ferries more as a result of the tunnel fire.
Andrew Darke, analyst at Williams de Broe, said ""There's clearly going to be some emotional reaction, but I expect it to be short-lived. After all passenger numbers rose after the Herald of Free Enterprise (ferry) disaster nine years ago.
""Disasters don't stop people travelling. People still go shopping in London despite IRA bombs,"" he said.
Eurotunnel had around 45 percent of the cross-Channel ferry market before the fire -- a share won partly by waging a cut-throat price-war with the ferries, which have since proposed linking up to battle against their tunnel rival.
Swedish ferry giant Stena Line and P&O agreed to merge in October and are awaiting clearance from competition bodies.
Darke said P&O's chances of clearance had been boosted by the tunnel disaster. The verdict is due later this month.",0
"Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry, striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts -- their profit margins.
Described by one British company as ""eco-terrorism"", it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s.
Famous names like Tarmac Plc, Costain Group Plc and ARC, a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc, have all been targeted.
Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless, badly organised ragbag of students and hippies.
""You only have to see them in action at protests,"" said David Harding, spokesman at ARC, Hanson's aggregates company. ""They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment, they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet -- we're talking about a highly sophisticated organisation.""
One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal ""Building"" earlier this year, ""If it comes down to full-scale economic warfare, we will aim to drive them out of business.""
As well as financial threats, companies also emphasise the ""terror"" tactics used.
Costain's contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass, which runs through a conservation area, has led to violent protests delaying building, bomb threats, staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell's home.
A Costain spokesman told Reuters:""We've had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive's house. But it's when it gets to the (employee) families -- that it goes across the line.""
Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves, which distribute leaflets with instructions on home-made explosives, are now the subject of a police investigation.
Other larger activist groups include Earth First, The Land is Ours, Alarm UK and Road Alert.
The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire.
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and out-of-town superstores which they say create more traffic, pollution and damage local communities.
The government has slashed its road-building spending. Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological.
Graham Watts, chief executive of the Construction Industry Council, said :""I don't think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project.
""But they are more alert than they were 3-4 years ago. There's no doubt it's a big issue now.""
He says the damage comes in two forms: ""Tangible -- in the form of extra costs, additional security, threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity.""
Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract.
""I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss.""
ARC says it's not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself.
Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass.
""It was called the ""First Battle of the Newbury bypass',"" said ARC's Harding.
""We had 300 Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site. Hundreds of thousands of pounds (dollars) of damage was done in one day. Plus there was the knock-on cost of lost production and extra security in future.""
Simon Brown, analyst at investement bank UBS, said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk.
""When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link (through Twyford Down) they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis.""
Harding says others have done the same. ""As a result of eco-terrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security.""
For an industry already suffering from razor-thin margins, overcapacity and stagnant demand, eco-terrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector's tale of woe.",0
"Britain's second biggest bus company Cowie Group said on Thursday it had been approached by a defence vehicle manufacturer about forming a leasing joint venture targeting clients including the Ministry of Defence.
Cowie told Reuters that the tentative approach was made this year and added it was open to considering new options for business.
But the bus and vehicle leasing giant played down a report by The Times newspaper which said the firm was pitching specifically to buy and lease battle tanks, saying such a move was ""highly speculative at this stage.""
Cowie conceded, however, that it had received an approach to form a leasing venture for military transportation equipment.
Robert Blower, a Cowie spokesman, told Reuters: ""A UK defence equipment supplier has approached us. Their idea was for Cowie to come in as player in the consortium, with our leasing expertise. We will assess each new idea on its merit.""
He said any move into military vehicles would have to be cleared with shareholders first, ""...for ethical as well as commercial reasons,"" he said.
On the subject of leasing out frontline tanks, Cowie was more cautious, admitting that there had been ""No talks with the MOD. But it has said that under PFI (private finance initiative) there aren't any no-go areas,"" said Blower.
The PFI scheme, applied across all government departments, aims to bring private cash into public spending projects including the option of the government leasing equipment. But an MOD spokesman was highly sceptical. Asked whether the MOD would put out a PFI project for tank leasing, he said
""Emphatically not. In broad terms the PFI rules nothing out and nothing in. Cowie has won a contract (with us) for forklift trucks and that is not. There is nothing else on the cards, let alone tanks.""
Cowie announced on Wednesday it had won a material handling equipment leasing contract with the MOD.
Tank and transportation equipment manufacturers like Vickers Plc were sceptical about reports of expanding leasing to military vehicles.
A Vickers spokeswoman told Reuters it did not approach Cowie and described the idea of leasing battle tanks as ""fairly off the wall. Leasing trucks is one things, but a battle tank is quite another,"" she said.
But GKN was more circumspect. Asked whether it had approached anyone about the idea of forming a leasing venture to supply the MOD or other markets, a spokeswoman said ""There are no discussions at this stage.""
U.S. giants have already caught onto the concept, with world leaders like Lockheed Martin and McDonald Douglas exploring the possibility of leasing military aircraft to Eastern European countries.
At 1159 GMT Cowie shares were down nearly two pence at 372-3/4p in a generally weaker British stock market.",0
"LucasVarity Plc, the U.S.-Anglo auto components giant formed in September, announced a major restructuring Tuesday, including the planned disposal of 13 non-core businesses and the elimination of 3,000 jobs over two years.
LucasVarity said it had identified a range of additional moves that will mean an extra 120 million British pounds ($200 million) in profit benefits -- double the level anticipated just three months ago when the company was formed in the merger of Lucas Industries of Britain and Varity Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y.
Worldwide employment will be cut by 3,000 over the next two years as a result of the moves, the company said.
LucasVarity said it also will take an extra one-time charge of 130 million pounds ($217 million), mainly in non-cash items, along with 120 million pounds ($200 million) in charges already planned for this year.
Thirteen companies were identified for sale in a three-month post-merger review, although only eight were named in the restructuring announcement -- all small businesses in Britain, Argentina and South Africa.
Chief Executive Victor Rice said in an interview that the company was ""sifting through some offers"" and expected to be in ""active negotiations"" on the sale of some of the 13 units quite soon.
Rice said major businesses like aerospace and electronics were not among the unnamed five.
The criteria for divestment were those firms which ""neither fitted into the core strategy of the company or contributed economic added value,"" Rice said.
Rice, who came from Varity, said the post-divestment savings were ""virtually double"" original expectations.
LucasVarity is involved in the design, manufacture and supply of systems, products and services in international automotive, diesel engine, aftermarket and aerospace industries.
Both parties in the merger specialised in braking systems and industry sources expected that many of the measures would affect production and employment in these units.",0
"Ford Motor Company Ltd, the U.S. carmaker's U.K. arm, said on Tuesday that the British sales outlook for 1997 looked pretty flat as customers suffered from a ""feeling-not-so-good"" factor.
Ian McAllister, chairman and managing director of Ford U.K., told Reuters in an interview at the British International Motor Show that weak sentiment was the primary reason for sluggish interest among UK consumers in the last three years.
""People were badly bitten by the recession and have become cautious about their own personal balance sheets,"" he said.
He added that it would require an end to consumer worries, like house owners' negative equity, and a cure for the recessionary hangover before the private car market took off.
Industry analysts have said that most of the growth in the UK car market has been due to companies buying cars, rather than the man on the street snapping up new models.
McAllister said company fleet sales would remain a priority for Ford in the coming year but said, ""We will reduce our exposure to the heavily discounted rental market.""
The UK chief agreed that the slight growth in sales across the wider European car market so far in 1996 had been distorted by government incentives in countries like France to trade in fuel guzzling old cars for new models, as well as heavy discounting by most car makers.
The underlying picture for the European car industry has been less promising, he acknowleged, agreeing that excess market capacity in Europe had fuelled downward pressure on margins for players across the board.",0
"Christian Salvesen, the transport to business services group which rejected a 1.1 billion pound hostile takeover from Hays, said on Monday its special dividend and power unit demerger gave ""much better"" shareholder value.
Chris Masters, Salvesen chief executive, told Reuters in an interview ""I think this (plan) is much better"" and ""more in the interests of our shareholders."" He said he thought the 150 million pounds special dividend and demerger plan for the Aggreko hire business compared favorably with the rejected 390 pence per share bid from Hays, ditched in August.  
Masters said the plan to spin off the fast-growing hire group Aggreko was the culmination of a six-year restructuring strategy.
He added that a review to deliver shareholder value had already been underway before the hostile Hays bid was made in the summer.
The path chosen by the board made the best financial sense in tax terms as well, he added.
He said the Aggreko business was now ready to go it alone and had strong growth prospects. ""It now operates in 20 countries and is a global market leader,"" he said.  
The logistics business, which will remain within the Salvesen group, also offered strong growth potential, said Masters.
""In Europe, logistics got half of its profits from food two years ago. Now that figure is less than 30 percent. Industrial logistics is growing at twenty percent per annum and the consumer business is growing at around 15 percent, with food manufacturing business also offering strong growth thanks to European deregulation.""
Christian Salvesen will be making its case to institutional shareholders over the next two weeks, said Masters, in a bid to persuade them that this package offers a better deal than the 1.1 billion takeover bid from Hays.
The board has been under pressure to deliver after suffering share price underperformance earlier this year against the Financial Times All Share index.",0
"Drugs giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc bought the remaining 50 percent of its Japanese joint venture Nippon Glaxo for 354 million pounds ($596 million) on Thursday in its quest for growth in the world's second biggest market.
Analysts in London said they had long expected the buy-out of Japanese partner Shin Nihon Jitsugyo Co Ltd, which will also get a 7.7 million pounds (1.38 billion) payout in lieu of the 1996 dividend.
Nippon Glaxo develops, produces and markets prescription medicines across Japan and has net assets of 30.7 billion yen ($275.3 million), as valued on June 30. Its post-tax profit for the six months to June 30 was 2.5 billion yen.
After setting up a series of Japanese joint ventures since the early 1980s, Glaxo has moved to take them over in a bid to carve a share in Japan's lucrative marketplace, second only to the U.S. in terms of profitability and sales to the group.
Seven percent of Glaxo Wellcome's profits stem from Japan, which represents 20 percent of the world market itself.
One London-based pharmaceuticals analyst said: ""The deal will be slightly earnings enhancing as it's financed by debt and Japanese interest rates are low at half a percent.""
The move to take over ventures in Japan would allow the group to accelerate growth plans by launching new products there, including its new respiratory treatments for asthma and the new herpes treatment Valtrex which replaces Zovirax.
Another analyst agreed that Japan offered a notable expansion opportunity, saying: ""It's obviously one of the leading growth markets for Glaxo.""
But shares in Glaxo showed little response, falling a modest 3.5 pence to 950 in London.
Under the deal, Hiroshi Konishi, president of Nippon Glaxo, and Akira Konishi, vice-president and general manager, will give up these positions but remain members of Nippon Glaxo's board, Glaxo Wellcome said.
Nippon Glaxo had net assets at June 30 of 30.7 billion yen, or 180 million pounds. Its profits after tax for the six months ended June 30 were 2.5 billion yen.

"The story of Sea Launch sounds like the daring fiction of a James Bond movie -- with corporate giants from Russia, the United States, Norway and Ukraine joining forces to build the ultimate in space technology, firing satellite rockets into space from the Pacific Ocean.
The cost is 350 million pounds ($583.2 million), funded by a consortium of four companies, joining the East and West in a deal that claims it can undercut the cost of land-based launchers including the French-led Ariane, recently embarrassed by a rocket explosion, and NASA.
The lead Sea Launch investor is Boeing Co.'s Commercial Space division, holding 40 percent, with RSC-Energia of Russia taking a 25 percent slice, Norway's Kvaerner with 20 percent and NPO-Yuzhnoye of Ukraine holding 15 percent.
At a sneak preview in Norway recently, Svein Johnsen, Sea Launch project manager from Kvaerner, joked with Russian reporters that countries that had once built technology with conflict in mind were now united in their quest for profit.
""In the name of detente,"" he said.
Norway's Kvaerner is the prime contractor, building the mobile seaborne rocket launch platform and the command ship.
It rescued an off-shore oil rig, which had been severely damaged in a 1988 explosion, and rebuilt it to become a floating rocket launcher that will operate under remote control from a specially built command ship.
The platform is nearing completion at Stavanger in Norway, with the command ship under construction and ready for launch next month at Govan in Scotland.
The first rocket launch is scheduled for June 1998 from a site in the Pacific Ocean.
Satellites and rockets will be assembled on the ship for transfer to the platform, which will be evacuated before liftoff.
The command ship will press the control button for firing the rocket at a distance of two or three miles. The 10,600-ton ship has the added protection of blastproof safety glass.
The Russians will provide the Zenit rockets, chosen because they can be assembled horizontally on board the command ship.
Boeing will provide project management, marketing services and run the operation for liftoff.
Asked about the risk of explosion Johnsen said, ""The risk of explosion is very much related to this business. But we think that risk is very low. There are built-in safety features and it's a very sound operation from an insurance point of view.""
Ignition to release of the rocket takes 4.6 seconds, with emissions from the rocket on takeoff channelled sideways.
""If the emissions didn't go sideways, the pressure could shift the platform,"" he said, which weighs 23,000 tons.
Confidence in the system, a world-first, has been demonstrated by a rash of early contracts.
Hughes Space and Communications International Inc. of Los Angeles has 10 launches signed. Space Systems/Loral, also from California has five booked.
The groups involved have refused to comment on how much they will charge per launch or on potential profits, with Kvaerner's Johnson only stating that its slice will be ""a good return on our investment.""
It will be able to fire six to eight rockets a year. The idea was originally conceived by Boeing, which had intended to fire satellites from a supertanker.
But the danger involved made the platform idea more appealing, allowing evacuation before blastoff.",0
"British building materials company Wolseley Plc reported a one percent slip in year pretax profits on Tuesday, but despite topping analysts' forecasts in a tough market shares slid on the poor outlook for mainland Europe.
Pretax profits for the year ended July 31 fell to 242.9 million pounds ($387 million) from 245.4 million. But sales rose to 4.31 billion from 3.78 billion pounds and the dividend was raised to 10.35 pence from 9.80 last year.
The fallback in profits had been flagged in a profit warning earlier this year.
But Wolseley survived the difficult conditions better than others partly thanks to its lower European exposure. The group has 50 percent of its sales in the U.S.
Chairman Richard Ireland reported organic sales growth across all three divisions blaming the lower profits on ""poor economic conditions in mainland Europe and volatile lumber prices in the U.S.""
""The results for 1996 should be set against the background of economic difficulties in France and Austria and a flat home (UK) market,"" he said.
But in an interview with Reuters chief financial controller Stephen Webster said ""I do not see an upturn in the next 12 months in France, Austria or Germany.""
He denied it would seriously dampen profits this coming year, explaining that conditions remain stable.
The UK market showed a glimmer of recovery, with spending on repair and maintenance of homes moving ahead.
But Webster said the housebuilding sector had seen companies using up existing stock so there has been little feed-through to companies like Wolseley. He predicted it would be spring before the industry felt the benefits.
The finance chief also expressed concern about the threat of an interest rate hike in the U.S. ""A half a percent would not be a big deal but one percent could damage confidence.""
The caution in all its markets was enough to push shares lower. By 1045 GMT they were down 13 pence at 494.
The new chief executive John Young did not signal any departure from the group's existing strategy.
But Webster signalled the possibility of some change ""We are keen to keep the good things. If anything it may mean a change of style. ""But there are no sacred cows in Wolseley. We will take difficult decisions if needed.""
Young said in the interim statement he wanted to look to expansion into new regions and products. With gearing at a low 7.7 percent, there is scope to raise it to around 30 percent if a big acquisition comes along, said Webster.

"British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group said on Friday it had clinched the CrossCountry passenger rail franchise and planned to spend an extra 250 million pounds ($420 million) on new trains and increased services.
CrossCountry, which covers more than 100 stations and is based in the central British city of Birmingham, is one of the last few passenger rail franchises to be awarded under Britain's rail priavatisation programme.
The company has 842 staff and in the year to March 30 passenger revenues were 108 million pounds.
""Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending 250 million on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid,"" Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, said in an interview.
Train orders will be placed next year, with the first deliveries due to be made in 2002. Under Virgin's financial terms with the government, it will get a subsidy in the first year of the 15 year franchise of 115 million pounds. This is 12 million pounds less than in 1996/97.
Whitehorn said the subsidy will be eroded over the 15 year term and in the final year Virgin Rail will make a 10 million payment to the government.
It will refurbish existing HST 125 diesel trains and has pledged to increase train miles by 14 percent. ""We will grow the service, we will not cut them."" he said.
The services will be rebranded under the Virgin name and cover destinations across England, Scotland and Wales.
This is the first rail franchise to be awarded to Virgin Rail which also bid unsuccessfully for the Gatwick Express route which went to National Express buses.
But Virgin is on the shortlist for the West Coast rail franchise and has a bid in for the Thameslink service in London. There are 25 rail franchises in all, covering passenger services across Britain.
So far the government has sold 14 franchises to the private sector as part of its privatisation of the entire network.
The Virgin empire, which spans everything from its airline, music and financial services to its own-label cola, already has a major rail business.
It is a partner in the London and Continental Railways consortium which owns the Eurostar passenger service linking London with Paris and Brussels through the Channel Tunnel.
Service through the Channel Tunnel were suspended last week after a serious fire.

"Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on October 1 as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while the new chief talks of export-led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms.
Imperial is Britain's second biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries and its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars.
It is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate floated companies to unlock value.
In the ten years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent. 1995 profits were 348 million pounds on 3.6 billion of sales.
But analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, marking it as the comeback kid of the tobbaco industry, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London.
This week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from U.S. President Bill Clinton to regulate the industry.
So far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic.
""If it happens in the U.S. it's subsequently followed in other countries,"" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
""Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,"" he said.
UBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.
But they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading - its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts.
Imperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears that it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East.
""We see investor concerns on litigation risk combined with the uncertain outlook in the key UK market as implying a 20-30 percent PE (price earnings) discount to the UK average."" This assumes a prospective PE of 9.9 times, UBS said in a note.
It has given Hanson a total break-up value of 164 pence, in a market range of 150 to 200 pence per share. Hanson shares were down 2 1/2 pence at 159 1/2 by 1033 GMT Friday.
UBS specifically values the Imperial constituent at 39 pence per share or 2.03 billion pounds ($3.14 billion).
However, another investment analyst who declined to be named, said he was more upbeat on Imperial's prospects.
""It's a clean business. It could become a takeover target and it's also very cash generative,"" he said.
He values Imperial at 37 pence in a total Hanson break-up valuation of 187 pence per share.
There is some upside to the Imperial story. Apart from being viewed as a highly efficient player and being the second biggest UK tobacco company with 38 percent of the market, it is also poised to try and tap the vast emerging markets.
Gareth Davis (corrects from Nigel Davis), Imperial's chief executive who joined the company straight from university, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
""Worldwide this industry is buoyant,"" he said.

The company, which has 842 staff and earned passenger revenues worth 108 million pounds ($181.3 million) in the year to March, is part of the national rail network that is in the process of being privatised.
""Virgin believes that it can be built into one of the prime rail franchises serving several markets...Exciting times are ahead,"" Branson told a London news briefing.
Will Whitehorn, director of Virgin Rail, told Reuters: ""Our key plan is to buy a new fleet, spending 250 million pounds on new rolling stock, agreed as part of the bid.""
The order will be placed next year, with the first deliveries due in 2002. Under financial terms, the government subsidy in the first year of the 15 year franchise will be 112.9 million pounds.
The 112.9 million subsidy has been cut from the 1996/97 level of 127 million pounds and will average at 36.4 million over the life of the franchise term.
Whitehorn said the subsidy will be eroded over the 15 year term and in the final year Virgin Rail will make a 10 million pound payment to the government.

"Two of the biggest names in the British motor industry, Rover and Vauxhall, kicked off the British International Motor Show on Tuesday by unveiling big new investments to fuel their drive for more exports.
Rover, owned by Germany's BMW, said it planned to launch a new four-wheel drive ""baby Land Rover"" to take on Japanese rivals in Britain and world export markets.
The new vehicle, due to go on sale in 1998, is part of Rover's rolling 3.0 billion pound ($4.75 billion) investment programme.
Rover will in addition inject 3.5 billion pounds of new business into the components industry. This will go mainly to British firms and safeguard tens of thousands of jobs at Rover and its supplier firms.
Vauxhall, owned by General Motors of the United States.S., also guaranteed 4,200 existing jobs at its Ellesmere Port complex in northwest England with the announcement of a 300 million pound investment to modernise the plant.
Efforts by both companies to gear up to expand foreign sales come as the British market is witnessing sluggish sales, with most growth stemming from sales to company car fleets.
The Birmingham-based motor show, following the recent Paris showcase, saw motor companies banging the sales drum, seeking to gloss over their problems with glitz and new gizmos to tempt customers into buying. But exports remain key.
Rover's new chief executive, Dr Walter Hasselkus, said: ""The baby Land Rover is very much an export product,"" adding that he hoped its export sales would account for 70 percent of production and boost sales in 1998.
Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly said while the British and European markets remained difficult, he saw opportunities for sales of the five-year old Astra model to grow quite significantly in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
Most industry leaders agree that Europe is likely to remain a cut-throat place to do business, with over-capacity squeezing margins.
Ian McAllister, head of Ford Motors in Britain, told Reuters that the six percent growth levels seen in Europe was distorted by factors like discounting and the French government offering incentives for customers to buy new cars.
Some analysts put underlying European growth as low as two percent, after stripping out factors like those cited by Ford.
McAllister blamed poor consumer interest in Britain on the ""feeling-not-so-good"" factor and predicted no turnaround until consumers were cured of their recessionary hangover.",0
"Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, fresh from its demerger from Hanson Plc in October, said on Monday it was capable of cutting back debt levels and investing in further export growth as a dual policy.
Gareth Davis, chief executive, told Reuters in an interview that the two could be achieved ""in parallel"" because of the group's strong cash generation.
In particular, Davis said Imperial was in talks with a Japanese company about entering the Japanese market for the first time. He also said the group would keep open the option of a share buyback in the future.
Imperial inherited around 1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion) of debt as its legacy from the Hanson family break-up. But Davis said this did not hamper the group's plans to seek distribution deals or joint ventures in the overseas cigarette markets and possibly examine small acquisition deals in the fragmented cigar market.
He added that, if an important larger-sized acquisition opportunity arose, he would be prepared to raise debt levels, but for the moment ""the priority is to get it down. Our situation, our ability to generate cash means we can do things in parallel - pay down debt and pay for acquisitions...Bolt-on acquisitions are more likely in the cigar area"", he added.
On the Japanese market in particular, Davis told Reuters ""We are looking to do something in Japan. We are actively considering this. In one way or another we will establish a presence in that market,"" admitting that talks were under way with one party.
But he sought to reassure shareholders that Imperial would not squander its sound financial inheritance in its bid to catch up in the overseas field. ""In our international expansion plans I would not dream of being a balance sheet wrecker,"" he said. If Imperial failed to find the right deals, it would be prepared to conside other options to return value, he said.
If a possible acquisition fails to offer sufficient rates of return ""we would say: what would a share buyback do to enhance shareholder value, rather than a potential acquisition?""
""A buyback is something we'd never rule out. Given our cash flow characteristics people tend to say ""What are you going to do with all that cash.'""
Imperial reports its first set of results since the Hanson demerger on December 5 when it will give a trading update of the first few months since its split.
Davis said he expected the British market to continue to decline at around two percent next year.
But the international business, accounting for 17 percent of profits in the first eight months of the year, is expected to show continued rapid growth.
""I would be very disappointed if it wasn't 25 percent by 2000."" The last two years have seen overseas sales double, but Davis drew the line at hitting his target by 1997.
""That would be overstating it (our confidence). But the signs are the business is showing strong growth.""
Despite his caution, Davis has said that the company has already clinched a deal with unions to add a third shift from May 1997 which has the potential to raise capacity at its Nottingham factory  by one third.
Imperial says if a number of overseas deals start feeding through it will be ready to meet the surge in demand.",0
"All four Hanson companies - due to be spun off as part of the demerger process - had received takeover approaches for part or all of the units in the chemicals, tobacco, building and energy sectors.
William Landuyt, chairman and chief executive of Millennium Chemicals and a Hanson group board member, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday ""We've had interest for every business in Hanson."" He said the ""expressions of interest"" included possible offers for whole divisions as well as individual companies within each of the four divisions to be floated separately.  
Landuyt, who will head up the U.S. chemicals giant Millennium which had 1995 sales of more than two billion stg and 588 million stg in operating profit, told Reuters his own empire had received approaches for all three of its units - Quantum, SCM and Glidco.
But he said that the board had decided against pursuing any of the approaches.
Landuyt also defended Millennium's decision to incorporate a so-called ""poison pill"" clause to protect it from a hostile takeover. He said it was necessary to prevent a predator buying up shares on the cheap and launching an undervalued bid.  
""We do expect selling pressure (for Millennium shares) for at least the first six months,"" said Landuyt who predicted selling pressure from UK investors.
""We don't want a temporary drop in the shareprice to allow someone to get a commanding position and launch a bid which does not offer full value.""
He said the poison-pill arrangement, which under law in the U.S. state of Delaware means that a company gaining a 15 percent stake in Millennium would see those shares become worthless. They would carry no vote or liquidation value unless the board had been approached first.  
However, the poison pill clause ends after one year, said the chemicals company chief, freeing the way for a possible bid.
He said if a full-value bid was launched before then, the board would be under a duty to examine it.",0
"Imperial Tobacco Group will split from conglomerate Hanson Plc on Oct. 1 as one of the most efficient players in its sector, but while its new chief talks of export-led growth, the outlook is clouded by the threat of litigation against tobacco firms.
Imperial is Britain's second-biggest tobacco firm after B.A.T Industries. Its brands include Embassy, John Player Special and Superkings cigarettes as well as Panama and Castella cigars.
It is one of four arms of the mighty Hanson conglomerate being spun off into separate companies.
In the 10 years since Hanson took over Imperial, it has slashed costs, cut its brands to 33 from 150 and raised productivity by 195 percent. Its 1995 profits were 348 million pounds ($538.9 million) on 3.6 billion ($5.6 billion) of sales.
But analysts fear that despite Imperial's impressive track record, its shares could face a rough ride once listed in London.
This week saw tobacco stocks hit by a backlash in the United States, with fresh litigation plus tough new curbs from President Clinton to regulate the industry.
So far, BAT Industries has borne the brunt. But some analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the U.S. scenario widens its impact and is repeated across the Atlantic.
""If it happens in the United States, it's subsequently followed in other countries,"" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
""Imperial could have been a ripe international takeover candidate. But the litigation threat means a group buying a tobacco company would have a tough time selling the idea to shareholders now,"" he said.
UBS analysts agree that the threat of legal action is enough to dampen the company's outlook.
But they warn of another possible dampener on the stock when Imperial starts trading -- its heavy reliance on Britain, largely seen as a mature market. Britain accounts for 87 percent of profits, say analysts.
Imperial has already committed itself to overseas expansion, but there are fears it will have a tough time muscling in on the U.S. giants, which have already made inroads into the markets of tomorrow - India, China and the Far East.
Gareth Davis, Imperial's chief executive, told the London-based Evening Standard newspaper earlier this week that he believed the group would continue to build up exports to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
""Worldwide this industry is buoyant,"" he said.",0
"St George Bank Ltd announced on Monday an agreed A$2.65 billion merger with Advance Bank Australia Ltd - its fifth merger attempt in the past two years.
The merger of the two Sydney-based regional banks would create Australia's fifth largest bank, with assets of A$40 billion and a market capitalisation of A$4.5 billion, making its of Australia's top 25 listed companies.  
Analysts said the plan for Advance to pay St George A$100 million if it were taken over by a third party was seen as a way to ward off other bids, making it look like it was fifth time lucky for the St George.
""I think that would make it unattractive for somebody else to come in and make a bid,"" said Linda Lyon, banking analyst at brokers BNP Equities.
St George said it would offer an effective A$7.30 for each share in Advance Bank.  
Advance shareholders would be offered a combination of A$2.10 in cash, a 20 cent special cash dividend and new St George shares up to a value of A$5.00 per Advance Bank.
St George said the total value of the offer was A$7.30 per share, representing a 20 percent increase over the average Advance Bank share price over the previous five trading days.
Advance shareholders will also receive Advance Bank's interim dividend, expected to be 20 cents, payable in February.
St George said it would also raise A$360 million in a new capital raising to help fund the bid. The issue would proceed upon completion of the acquisition, expected to in April.  
St George said the merger was driven by the need to lower costs and a review had found the merger could achieve a reduction of 15 percent in annual combined expenses or A$140 million before tax.
Advance shares soared over 10 percent on the announcement.
Analysts said that although there would be cost savings, the price was still fairly generous.
""My initial reaction is that it looks like Advance Bank shareholders are coming out of the deal quite well, whereas St George shareholders are coming out not so well,"" said one Sydney-based banking analyst.  
""It's a big price. I can't imagine anybody else coming and topping the price St George is offering,"" said BNP's Lyon.
Analysts said the offer valued Advance at 2.8 times net asset backing, well above the 2.0 times asset backing level at which recent Australian bank merger prices had been based.
St George has been desperate to have a friendly merger as it is seen as a takeover target itself.
Australia's largest banking group, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), holds a 6.8 percent stake in St George.
NAB has said it has no takeover plans for St George.  
Analysts said the Wallis inquiry into Australia's finance and banking sector might put NAB's acquisition plans on hold until the inquiry reported its findings in March.
St George's bid for Metway Bank Ltd earlier this year was scuttled by the Queensland government, which trumped its offer with a higher bid through its wholly-owned financial services group Suncorp and the Queensland Industry and Development Corp (QIDC). Last year, St George was foiled in its merger bid for Perth-based Challenge Bank Ltd when Westpac Banking Corp made a higher offer.  
St George was also in talks last year to merge with the Bank of Western Australia Ltd, before the Bank of Scotalnd Ltd took control, and the Bank of South Australia, which was takeover by Advance early 1995.
St George shares plunged after the announcement.
At 2.20 p.m. (0420 GMT) Advance Bank shares were 69 cents or 10.99 percent higher at A$6.97 while St George shares were 40 cents or 4.47 percent down at A$8.55.",0
"British Airways Plc (BA) said on Tuesday that it had no plans for new alliances over the next few years, but would extend its global reach by franchising its popular brand name to smaller airlines.
British Airways has an alliance with Australian carrier Qantas Airways Ltd and formed an alliance with American Airlines in June, although this is subject to regulatory approvals and a legal suit by USAir Group, in which BA holds 24.6 percent.
""One of the great challenges of alliance development is the management challenge and I think it would be unwise to take on any more than we can absorb at any one time,"" BA chief executive Robert Ayling said at an industry luncheon in Sydney.
Reports that BA would look to an alliance with a Japanese airline, notably Japan Airlines, were quashed by Ayling in a speech to the National Aviation Press Club in Sydney.
""I think the Japanese airline industry is an independent industry and I think it will remain a strongly independent industry. If there are opportunities in the future for developing relationships there with other carriers then obviously we will do that,"" Ayling said.  
However, Ayling said the airline's four-year experiment with franchising its brand name to smaller airlines was successful and would be an area of future growth, providing safety and customer service standards were met.
""It is a way of bringing extended services to customers and of allowing operators of smaller airlines, who would have found it very difficult to survive in this world of global networks, to be more successful,"" Ayling said.
In June, BA signed its first franchise agreement outside of the European Union with South Africa's largest independent carrier, Comair. Under the deal Comair's eight-jet fleet will use the British Airways name and livery.
Under the existing rules it would have been impossible to acquire or invest more than 50 percent in an airline in South Africa, said Ayling. ""South Africa is a part of the world which would not be open to us if we didn't have this deal,"" he said.
Ayling is visiting Australia to look at the operations of BA's 25 percent stake in Qantas, the national carrier.
Under the alliances with American Airlines and Qantas, BA and its partners fly to over 500 destinations in about 100 countries. Ayling said BA's global alliance could lead to opportunities in other parts of the world.  
""We may see, although this may be some way off, fleet acquisition opportunities, which would make a significant impact on procurement of aircraft,"" said Ayling.
""Once these agreements are put in place and they are being effectively managed, we will be able to see some things we are not able to see at the moment,"" he said.
Two weeks ago, BA reported an 11.1 percent rise in first quarter profits to 150 million sterling (US$231 million) on sales of 2.103 billion sterling. It forecast another record year in the year to March 1997.",0
"Canadian media baron Conrad Black said on Wednesday he wanted to increase his stake in Australia's oldest newspaper group, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd, to 50 percent from 25, a day after meeting the prime minister.
However, Black repeated that he would sell out of Fairfax if there was no easing in Australia's current media ownership rules, which he described as ""anachronistic"".
Black said that although he could not rule out selling his stake to Kerry Packer, the suggested merger plan by Packer between his media empire and Fairfax was unlikely to suceed.  
Black told shareholders at Fairfax's annual meeting that he had said to John Howard in their first meeting since Howard became prime minister that he would like to raise his stake, which is held through Hollinger International Inc.
Black was asked by reporters after Fairfax's meeting just how much he would want to increase his stake to, if allowed. ""Fifty percent,"" he said.
The media baron added that U.S. accounting rules effectively punished companies which had higher than 50 percent stakes in their associates. However, Black repeated that he would sell his Fairfax stake if he was not allowed to raise it further.  
""If the road is truly blocked, then obviously we are going,"" Black said. He added that Hollinger would not lodge any application for a higher stake until the government ended its study into media ownership and presented new ownership rules.
Under Australia's current media ownership rules, foreigners are prevented from owning more than 25 percent of a newspaper group or 15 percent of a television group. They also prevent a newspaper group owner from owning more than 15 percent of a television station in the same city and vice-versa. ""These thing as they are now are very anachronistic,"" Black told reporters.  
In August, Packer's main media group, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL) proposed a merger between PBL and Fairfax only if media ownership rules were liberalised. PBL owns top-rating Nine Network and 15 percent of Fairfax.
Black said PBL's merger proposal was unlikely to succeed while he (Black) was a shareholder. ""He (Packer) would have quite a time getting that one through,"" Black said.
""I don't ever rule out anything, but I think that's fairly improbable. If Mr Packer wants to control Fairfax he's going to have to it the old-fashioned way and pay for it."" Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd owns five percent of Fairfax.  
""I know he's averse to doing that,"" Black said. He added he was not particularly interested in any stock swap deal with Packer which would leave him with a PBL stake.
Black said John Fairfax's profits were starting to improve.
Fairfax reported a 41 percent fall in net profit to A$87.4 million in the year to June 30, 1996.
""It's starting to look a little better now. Profits are affected by increased newsprint, they are affected by increased depreciation because of the plant at Chullora, cash flow rates are starting to improve a little bit,"" Black said. Fairfax spent A$330 million on a new printing plant at Chullora in Sydney.  
Fairfax chairman Sir Laurence Street told shareholders the slower Australian economy coupled with higher newsprint prices would impact on the group's final results for the 1996/97 year.
""Coupled with the state of the economy, Fairfax, in common with the whole newspaper industry, has had to face high newsprint prices and this, too, will impact upon our final results in the current year,"" Street said.
At 3.45 p.m. (0435 GMT) Fairfax shares were two cents higher at A$2.69, giving it a market capitalisation of A$2.04 billion.",0
"Rupert Murdoch's global media group, The News Corp Ltd, on Tuesday reported an 8.1-percent fall in net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97, in stark contrast to market expectations of a healthy rise.
But analysts said Murdoch's forecast last month at News Corp's annual meeting that the group would achieve a profit lift of 20 percent for the year to June 30, 1997 was still possible.
The film, television, publishing and newspaper conglomerate reported net profits of A$283 million (US$223 million) for the three months ended September 30, down from A$308 million a year earlier.
Analysts had forecast net profit before abnormal items would be around A$320-330 million, up around 15 percent.
Net profit before abnormals came in at A$285 million.
The poor result caused News Corp shares to fall sharply and dragged the whole Australian share market lower.
The share price fall wiped over A$300 million of the group's market capitalisation. The stock closed 18 cents or 2.52 percent lower at A$6.95 with over 4.7 million shares traded.
The weaker profit was a result of poorer returns in U.S. TV, Australian newspapers and book publishing, News Corp said.
""This is not as people were expecting type of result. It was a very flat result,"" one Sydney-based media analyst said.
News Corp could still report a 20 percent rise in net profits for the 1996/97 year as it was only the U.S. television business that was clearly below forecast, analysts' said. They said this forecast by Murdoch was in U.S. dollar terms.
In U.S. dollar terms, News Corp operating income was seven percent higher in the first quarter.
""Basically, what News has said is 'the first quarter was a bit disappointing but you are still going to get your growth for the year',"" one Melbourne-based analysts said after taking part in an analysts' conference telephone call with News Corp.
News Corp said its profit was mainly bolstered by the worldwide box office success of the science fiction movie Independence Day and its British newspapers and book publishing.
Independence Day, a film about invading aliens who launch an attack against the Earth from huge space ships, has grossed more than US$670 million worldwide, making it the third highest-grossing film in box office history.
British newspaper operations enjoyed strong growth with an 18-percent gain in operating profits in the three months to September, News Corp said. The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times newspapers all posted gains in both advertising and circulation revenues in the first quarter.
""Additionally, the group has benefitted from reduced newsprint costs,"" the company said.
""Offsetting these gains were weaker results in U.S. television, Australian newspapers and book publishing, which lacked results from the educational division which was sold in March 1996,"" it said.
News also said continued losses for its Asian satellite broadcaster, STAR TV, were in line with expectations.
The fall in profit in Australian dollar terms also reflected the stronger local currency against the U.S. dollar as about 75 percent of News Corp's revenue is in U.S. dollars.
The first quarter profit drop follows a profit dip for News Corp in the 1995/96 year, when it reported a six-percent fall in pre-abnormals net profit to A$1.26 billion.",0
"Australia's biggest gambler Kerry Packer, a patron of Las Vegas casinos, on Monday raised his stakes in the local burgeoning casino industry with the acquisition of management control at Sydney Harbour Casino.
Packer's media group Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd said it would spend A$340 million on a 10 percent stake in Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd (SHC) and 85 percent of the management contract of the casino from U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc.  
PBL's investment both in the management contract and the shares of SHC would show very attractive financial returns over time, PBL chairman Brian Powers said in a statement.
""This transaction represents a major move into the gaming industry for PBL and provides us with an ideal base from which to build a substantial business in this dynamic industry,"" Powers said.
""This advances our strategic goal of building a third core business alongside our television and publishing businesses,"" he said. PBL also has a option over part of Showboat's remaining 16.1 percent stake in SHC.  
Showboat president and chief executive officer Kell Houssels said in the statement the transaction provided an opportunity to realise a superior return on its investment, while maintaining a major ownership position in the Sydney casino.
Packer, Australia's richest man, has sought control of the Sydney casino for the past three years. In 1994 Packer led a consortium to bid for the 12-year Sydney casino licence, but lost out to the Showboat led consortium in December 1994.
Since losing the Sydney casino license bid, Packer interests have launched several legal actions against Showboat for the award of the licence by the New South Wales (NSW) government.  
Packer's punt on SHC shares have already made him a profit as shares in both the casino owner and PBL rose strongly after the deal was announced before Monday's sharemarket open.
In early afternoon trade, SHC shares were at a record high of A$2.27, a 34 cent or 17.61 percent rise in active trade, while PBL shares were 25 cents higher at A$6.35.
The deal was good for both companies as Packer's influence was likely to yield a tax-concession for the casino on the high-roller market, which is seen boosting cash flow for both the casino and PBL, Australian market analysts said.  
SHC owns the only legal casino in Sydney and has battled the New South Wales state government for the past 16 months to get a similar tax rate to other Australian casinos.
""I think Packer will probably get the tax-break from the government,"" one Sydney-based casino analyst said. ""I expect there will be some tax-break announcement this month,"" he said.
The Sydney casino is seeking a 10 percent tax concession from the state government on big spending gamblers, mainly from Asia, compared with the present tax rate of 27 percent.  
PBL is also expected to end the disappointing run of operating results the casino has reported since it opened a temporary casino in September 1995. The casino is expected to open a A$1.0 billion permanment casino later this year.
Packer also has a 10 percent stake in Melbourne casino operator Crown Ltd and about 20 percent of Hudson Conway Ltd, which in turn owns 37 percent of Crown.
""Given the Packer-Hudson Conway type of relationship it looks like there is a bit more to come out of this one,"" said Richard Wolf, a casino analyst at Bell Securities.",0
"The international partners in Australia's largest gas project said on Thursday they plan to spend A$6.0 billion (US$4.7 billion) to double production, making it Australia's largest single resources investment.
Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd said the partners in the North-West Shelf gas project offshore Western Australia planned to double production capacity to 14.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) a year.
The decision by the North West Shelf partners was unlikely to boost the much-touted prospect of a co-operative development with the nearby Gorgon gas field, which has the capacity to produce six million tonnes of LNG a year, analysts said.
""The North West shelf partners have their own plans for expansion, but if the Gorgon partners have a good proposal that we can work together then we will certainly have a look at it,"" said Woodside's corporate affairs manager Geoff Wedgwood.
""But to date we have not seen a plan from them that fits within our plans,"" Wedgwood told Reuters.
Last month an executive of Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a partner in both projects, raised hopes that the two projects could be developed together and questioned the expansion of the North West Shelf on a stand-alone basis.
Cor Herkstroter, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's committee of managing directors, then told Reuters in an interview that expansion of the North West Shelf could not be justified without integrating it with another project and that the development of both projects was a viable option.
Royal Dutch/Shell also owns 34 percent of Woodside.
Woodside, the North West Shelf project operator, said the expansion plan was submitted to the project's eight Japanese power and gas utility customers at a meeting in Osaka this week.
LNG is mainly used for fuelling power stations.
""It is a significant step for the expansion of the North West Shelf project,"" Wedgwood said. The partners have spent A$12 billion on the project since it started in the early 1980s.
Woodside is an equal 16.66 percent shareholder in the project along with some of the world's major oil producers.
The Osaka meeting followed indications from buyers in June of their interest in an expansion of the project, said Woodside.
However, work on the expansion would not start for another two years at least, Wedgwood said.
""The next thing that is likely to be a letter of intent in late 1997 for the development of this expansion proposal,"" Wedgwood said. He said between now and then there were lots of talks on technical issues surrounding the expansion proposal.
""Following that, would be a purchase agreement between the North West shelf partners and the Japanese buyers, which would be around late 1998,"" Wedgwood said.
Only after this agreement would work start on the expansion.
The other partners in the North West Shelf are Australia's The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, British Petroleum Plc, Chevron Inc of the United States, and Japanese groups Mitsui & Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.
Royal Dutch/Shell and Chevron are also partners in Gorgon along with U.S. oil giants Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp.",0
"Investment bank Macquarie Bank Ltd reported on Monday a record result for the six months ended September 30, and started the second half optimistically.
Macquarie Bank, which is 13.4 percent owned by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), reported a 21.3 percent rise in first half net profit to A$46.03 million in the first half of 1996/97.
""This was a very solid first half result and one which reflects more even contributions fom business groups across the bank,"" executive chairman David Clarke said.  
""Although it is too early to make a forecast, we are optimistic about the second half,"" Clarke said.
While the 1995/96 second half was very strong, he said the bank was hopeful it could at least match the result.
""There has been nothing to change that view following the trading for the first two months of this half.""
Managing director Allan Moss said the equities, treasury and commodities group accounted for most of the first half rises.
""The Treasury and Commodities Group's first half result is the best since the formation of the group in 1993,"" Moss said.  
""The strong result in the Equities Group reflects good performances from institutional and corporate stockbroking and underwriting,"" Moss said.
Moss said the near 400 percent increase in profit from its stockbroking arm, Macquarie Equities Ltd, was due partly to an increase in market share, but mainly due to market volume.
Macquarie's Direct Investment division, which manages the Macquarie Investment Trusts, also had a good result, Moss said.
The bank was currently very active right across all its operations, Moss said. ""We are busy right across the board. There is a lot of activity in all our operations,"" he said.  
Macquarie said total operating income rose to A$232.69 million in the half, from A$190.21 million a year earlier.
The Brunei government-owned BIA became Macquarie's largest shareholder after it bought Lloyds TSB Plc's 13.4 percent stake for A$151.7 million last week.
Macquarie's chairman said there had been a good reaction to the link with BIA.
""We have had a very positive reaction from a number of existing clients, particularly in southeast Asia. I think it has been widely acclaimed in southeast Asia that it would lead to more business in the region,"" Clarke said.  
Macquarie, which listed in late July, reported a net profit of A$93.17 million in the year to March 31, 1996, up from A$76.07 million a year earlier.
Clarke said Macquarie had no plans to return capital to shareholders or to make a takeover due to its high capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Macquarie's CAR was 13.6 percent at September 30, down from 15.4 percent at March 31, 1996.
This ratio compares with the Reserve Bank of Australia's minimum requirement of eight percent.
""As far as any prospect of share acquisition or buy-back, we have nothing in mind yet,"" Clarke said.  
""I think it is the nature of our business to have a capital adequacy ratio that is higher than the trading banks because we are very dependent on counter-party limits from other banks, they in turn are quite dependent on ratings...it is a healthy capital adequacy ratio and I think we can expect to be well and truly above the basic minimum,"" Clarke said.
At 2.00 p.m. (0300 GMT), Macquarie shares were 11 cents lower at A$8.55 with about 160,000 shares traded in a generally weaker Australian sharemarket.
The shares listed on the local bourse in July at A$6.95.",0
"The recent surge in the Australian dollar and higher jet fuel prices are going to hurt exporters of fresh food in particular, according to Australian Federation of International Forwarders (AFIF) chief executive Brian Lovell.
""With the rise in the fuel price and the higher Australian dollar it is going to affect a lot of exporters,"" Lovell said.
""The hardest hit are going to be the perishible exports,"" Lovell said, referring to Australia's fresh food exporters to mainly to Asian countries.
Lovell said exporters, who had entered contracts before the recent freight rate hike, could now be finding they cannot meet their contract obligations due to the extra charge.
""This can really affect things as you might have signed the contract and then suddenly realised that you can't afford to move it,"" Lovell told Reuters in an interview.
""There are some people that won't be able to get out of a binding contract,"" Lovell said.
Lovell said many AFIF members were surprised by the freight rate rises by some local air carriers, due to the strength of the local dollar, which had given carriers greater buying power.
""They are buying fuel now more cheaply,"" Lowell said.
Qantas Airways Ltd has increased its jet fuel surcharge, while Ansett Airlines Ltd has kept its freight rates unchanged.
The Australian dollar has risen four percent to its current level of US$0.8000 over the past five months.
Lovell said that although airfreight volumes had been growing over recent years, there was now a move by exporters to transport perishable goods to Asia by fast ferry.
""I would say in the next 10 years we will see a lot more freight carried by fast ferries, as it is more economical to carry them by ferry than plane as fuel costs are lower.""
Lovell said some of the AFIF's 250 members were in dispute with some of the airports over the management of cargo terminals, but this had not impeded freight movement.
AFIF was formed in October following the merger of Australian Dederation of Air Freight Forwarders and the International Forwarders Association of Australia.",0
"Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it wanted to grab a slice of the lucrative Asian high-roller market but first had to win a tax break from the state government.
The company holds a 12-year licence to operate the only legal casino in Australia's largest city but has battled with the New South Wales (NSW) government for the past 15 months to receive the same tax concession that its interstate rivals have.
""I am hopeful, but I can't say anything concrete at this stage,"" chief executive officer Neil Gamble told Reuters in an interview. The Sydney casino is 26.3 percent owned by U.S. casino operator Showboat Inc.
(Corrects to add Gamble's first name and title)
Without the 10 percent tax concession on winnings made by the high-rollers, the Sydney casino could only watch as rich Asian customers headed to casinos in Melbourne, Perth and on the Gold Coast, Gamble said.
""As far as the high-rollers are concerned it makes us totally uncompetitive."" Gamble said the high-rollers also required other incentives to be lured to Sydney.
""The professional gamblers would have about A$100,000 (US$80,000) to spend on a weekend, some would go up to A$2 million or A$3 million, some go up to tens of millions of dollars, but that is rare.""
If the Sydney casino could have its big gamblers tax reduced from more than 27 percent at the moment, it would then open a network of marketing offices around Asia, he said, adding to its representation in Hong Kong and Singapore.
So far its revenue from high rollers is negligible as 90 percent of the 12,000 people that visit the casino daily are considered locals.
The Sydney casino currently operates out of temporary premises but plans to open a A$1 billion permanent casino late next year, with 1,500 gaming machines and 200 gaming tables, a hotel and two theatres.
The casino has posted a string of disappointing results since it opened its doors in September 1995, with Gamble largely attributing this to over-optimistic forecasts in the prospectus.
""I think the prospectus forecast was too bullish,"" Gamble said ""I don't think that was a failure of mangement to achieve I think it was an over estimate of reality by any comparsion with other parts of this industry.""
The casino floated on the local bourse in June 1995 and forecast an operating profit after tax of A$37 million for the 1995/96 year. It reported an actual net loss of A$4.68 million in the financial year to June 30, 1996.
The recent sell down by international financier and founding shareholder George Soros was not a vote of no-confidence in the group, Gamble said. Soros now has under five percent down from 9.8 percent at the time of the float.
Since Soros sold down his stake in mid-November, Sydney casino shares have fallen eight percent. Sydney Harbour Casino shares closed steady at A$1.78 on Tuesday.",0
"Building materials group James Hardie Industries Ltd reported on Friday a first half net profit in line with expectations, but comments on the second half by the group is likely to see full year earnings forecasts trimmed.
James Hardie, 27.23 owned by New Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd, reported a 12.1 percent fall in net profit before abnormals to A$27.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 1996, in line with analysts' forecasts.
But managing director Keith Barton said he expected the second half result to be significantly down on the first half.  
Analysts at the company's results briefing said Barton's comments on the second half meant that estimates for pre-abnormal net profit for the 1996/97 year would be trimmed back to around A$50 million from A$53-A$54 million.
They welcomed the company's statement that outlook for its U.S. businesses were very positive for the 1996/97 second half and into 1997/98.
""In contrast, the outlook for Australian operations remains bleak in the short term,"" it said.  
""In view of the immediate prospects, the company maintains its previously stated position that profit for the full year will reflect a marked deterioration on last year's results,"" the company said.
""Growth prospects for the following year remain very positive,"" James Hardie said.
Keith Barton said the first half downturn reflected a fall in earnings from Australian building products due to lower housing starts.  
""Reduced activity in the housing sector had an adverse impact on both volumes and margins for the Australian building boards, windows and bathroom products businesses,"" he said.
Continued strong performances from the fibre cement and gypsum businesses in the United States as well as solid performances from New Zealand had however helped the result.
""U.S. fibre cement production sold out during the six months to September and we continue to ship significant volumes of product from Australian and New Zealand plants to satisfy demand,"" Barton said.  
Hardie had just increased U.S. fibre cement production capacity by more than 40 percent to 480 million square feet through the commissioning of a third line at Plant City in Florida.
However analysts said the market would not be worrying too much about 1996/97 results, which are widely expected to be down on the A$58.4 million pre-abnormal net profit reported in the year to March 31, 1996.
Barton said he expected a rebound in profit in the year to March 31, 1998, following an expected fall in profit in the 1996/97 year.  
""I expect it to be higher, but it is too early to say if it will be significantly higher,"" Barton later told reporters.
Analysts forecast James Hardie to have pre-abnormal net profit earnings of about A$90 million in 1997/98.
Barton also revealed that the Sydney-based group was conducting a study of the European fibre cement market, but had made no decison to enter any European countries yet.
""We are going to have a look, it is a large market,"" Barton said. ""It is early days, we are just having a look to see if we can understand the market.""  
Sales for the first half rose 2.7 percent to A$913.9 million, while the dividend remained unchanged at 6.5 cents per share.
At 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT), James Hardie shares were six cents lower at A$3.40 in a weaker Australian sharemarket that has been hit by a slump in the local bond market.",0
"Canadian gold mining giant Placer Dome Inc on Thursday announced plans to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific region through takeover offers worth a total of US$600 million for two Australian-listed gold miners.
Placer Dome launched takeover offers for Papua New Guinea (PNG) miner Highlands Gold Ltd and a mop-up offer for its Australian offshoot Placer Pacific Ltd.
If Placer Dome succeeds with both bids it will have control of PNG's biggest gold mine. PNG's Porgera mine is expected to produce over 940,000 ounces of gold in calendar 1996.
""It (the takeover) recognises the prospectivity that we see of the Asia-Pacific region and our desire to take full advantage of any opportunities that exist here,"" said Placer Dome's chief executive officer John Willson.
However, there were no plans to acquire more assets in the Asia-Pacific region, he said. However, Placer Pacific has stepped up its exploration activity in Asia in recent years with programmes in China, Indonesia and the Philippines.
The takeover bids were well received by investors on the Australian share market, with both Highlands and Placer Pacific shares soaring in active trade on the bid announcements, which were made before Thursday's market open.
However, the bids were not so welcomed by Highlands, which said Placer Dome's offer of 75 cents (US$0.61) for each Highlands shares was inadequate. However, Placer Pacific was more coy, it advised shareholders to take no action on the bid.
The Sydney-based Placer Pacific was partly floated in 1986 by its parent, which in turn now plans to buy-out the rest of the 24.6 percent it does not own through a share swap of one Placer Dome share for every 15 Placer Pacific shares.
Placer Dome, a Vancouver-based miner and one of the world's top three gold producers, plans to finance its A$425 million Highlands purchase through the issue of prefered shares.
""When we are done with this acquisition assuming it goes ahead, we will have debt of about US$1.0 billion and equity of US$1.7 billion,"" Willson said
""We will then refinance the Highlands gold purchase through a preferred share issue and we look at asset sales to bring our equity close to US$2.0 billion and with debt below $1.0 billion, we will be well within our range on a debt-to-equity basis.""
Highlands has stakes in two potentially large mining projects in PNG. The Nena/Frieda River copper/gold project and the Ramu nickel-cobalt deposit, both projects are estimated to cost a total of US$1.5 billion to develop.
In regards to Highlands non-gold assets, Willson said: ""We don't know much about them or what we are going to do with them, to develop them, sell them, or swap them.""
Australian gold analysts said the Canadian gold miner was likely to succeed with its two bids. ""I think they will walk it in,"" said David Kauler, gold mining analyst at ANZ Securities.
Analysts said the offers are probably opportunistic, given that Placer Pacific and Highlands share prices were both earlier this year above Placer Dome's offer prices. But both have fallen with the gold price, which is currently around 2-1/2 year lows.
Highlands shares closed 17 cents or 29 percent higher at 75 cents, Placer Dome has amassed a 33 percent stake in Highlands over the past two days. Placer Pacific shares closed 42 cents or 29.37 percent higher at A$1.85 with 5.5 million shares traded.",0
"Australian fast ferry and transport group Holyman Ltd plans to further expand operations in Europe before moving into the Asian market, managing director Christopher Butcher said in an interview.
""We currently have operations in North America and northern Europe and we can't see any reason why we can't start doing the same thing in the Mediterranean,"" Butcher told Reuters.
Butcher said Holyman was likely into expand into Asia in the future as the cost structure for operating fast ferries improved in some markets in the region.  
""We could be seeing the cost structure changing in Asia, so we are likely to move into some markets in north Asia and south east Asia,"" Butcher said.
He said that as incomes rose in Asia the amounts charged for ferry services would rise, making it more economical for operators like Holyman to enter the market.
Holyman company secretary Simon Lennon said the company was also looking at fast ferry services from Darwin to Indonesia, but he did not expect a decision to be made for at least a year.  
""It is one of a number of projects we are looking at in the region,"" he said. He said Holyman had looked at particular routes within China and Indonesia, but they did not fit within the company's plans. ""I would imagine in a few years we would have something up there (in Asia),"" Lennon said.
Holyman shares had a lacklustre showing in its first year of listing, but since January this year the shares have more than doubled to make the stock one of the strongest sharemarket performers over the past year.
The shares listed in April 1994 at A$2.00 and hit a high of A$6.00 on November 11 and are currently trading around A$5.06.  
The Sydney-based group was floated on the local bourse in April 1994, as part of a spin-off from TNT Ltd, when the transport group was selling assets to trim its high debts.
""The stock really took some time to get off the ground,"" Butcher said.
""I think there has been a lot of hard work done over the past year to educate shareholders in what the company is doing and where the company is going as there was a perception out there that we were a mismash of businesses,"" Butcher said.  
Holyman's main activities are its fast ferry services in Australia, across the North Sea between Britain and Europe, New York and in Denmark. It also operates a gas pipeline, bulk commodity handling and freight forwarding businesses.
""There are a number of different projects and businesses, we found there are quite a lot of common threads going through,"" Butcher said. ""I think these operations all have their own place and there are opportunties to expand these further,"" he said.
Butcher worked with TNT for 25 years before taking charge of Holyman when it split from TNT.  
Butcher said the group had no plans to raise capital to fund the expected expansion, as the company was well financed.
In October, Holyman bought a fast passenger ferry for A$43 million. He said there was no plans for any immediate purchases of more ferries.
Butcher said he could not comment on its trading performance or earnings forecasts.
Holyman reported a net profit of A$16.09 million in calendar 1995. The group posted a net profit of A$15.03 million in the six months to June 30, 1996, up from A$6.79 million earlier.",0
"Australia's information technology and telecommunication industry (IT&T) on Tuesday welcomed a decision by Asia-Pacific leaders that would lead to a substantial reduction in tariffs.
""It is certainly welcome, as the telecommunications area has some very strong barriers in many markets,"" said Fleur Bayley, export manager of the Australian Informational Industry Association (AIIA).  
Bayley told Reuters that Australia has no trade barriers on IT&T equipment, whereas local companies have to compete in markets that have high tariff barriers.
The meeting in the Philippines of 18 leaders of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies endorsed a United States plan to free the annual US$500 billion global trade in computers, memory chips and telecommunications equipment.
However, most IT&T observers wanted more details about the tariff plan before they could assess its implications for the Australian sector.  
One computer industry analyst said the APEC plan is likely to benefit Australian IT&T exports, but is unlikely to stimulate growth of technology imports into Australia.
""One would have thought with the relative maturity of our market that exports could increase faster than imports,"" the analyst said.
He said there could be a mild boost in demand from home users of computers, but it is unlikely to affect the demand in the corporate market.  
But another analyst said most of Australia IT&T exports are from multinational corporations with operations in Australia and these companies are the ones that are most likely to benefit.
Australia exported more than A$2.5 billion in IT&T goods in the 12 months to September this year but imported around A$9.6 billion worth of IT&T goods over the same period.
U.S. computer giant International Business Machines Corp lBM exports about A$500 million of its computers from Australia to Asia, making it the country's single largest technology exporter.  
French telecommunictaions equipment maker Alcatel Alsthom is another multinational with large export volumes from Australia.
AIIA's Bayley said the association has a target of A$10 billion in IT&T exports by the year 2000.
A decade ago, Australia's IT&T exports were negligible.",0
"The international partners in Australia's largest gas project said on Thursday they plan to spend A$6.0 billion to double production, making it Australia's largest single resources investment.
Australian oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd said the partners in the North West Shelf gas project offshore Western Australia plan to double production capacity to 14.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) a year.  
The decision by the North West Shelf partners was unlikely to boost the much-touted prospect of a co-operative development with the nearby Gorgon gas field, which has the capacity to produce six million tonnes of LNG a year, analysts said.
""The North West shelf partners have their own plans for expansion, but if the Gorgon partners have a good proposal that we can work together then we will certainly have a look at it,"" said Woodside's corporate affairs manager Geoff Wedgwood.
""But to date we have not seen a plan from them that fits within our plans,"" Wedgwood told Reuters.  
Last month an executive of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, a partner in both projects, raised hopes that the two projects could be developed together and questioned the expansion of the Shelf on a stand-alone basis.
Cor Herkstroter, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell's committee of managing directors, then told Reuters in an interview that expansion of the North West Shelf could not be justified without integrating it with another project and that the development of both projects was a viable option.
Royal Dutch/Shell also owns 34 percent of Woodside.  
Woodside, the project operator, said the expansion plan was submitted to the project's eight Japanese power and gas utility customers at a meeting in Osaka this week.
""It is a significant step for the expansion of the North West Shelf project,"" Wedgwood said. The partners have spent A$12 billion on the project since it started in the early 1980s.
Woodside is an equal one-sixth shareholder in the project along with some of the world's major oil producers.
The Osaka meeting followed indications from buyers in June of their interest in an expansion of the project, said Woodside.  
However, work on the expansion would not start for another two years at least, Wedgwood said.
""The next thing that is likely to be a letter of intent in late 1997 for the development of this expansion proposal,"" Wedgwood said. He said between now and then there are lots of talks on technical issues surrounding the proposal.
""Following that would be a purchase agreement between the North West shelf partners and the Japanese buyers, which would be around late 1998,"" Wedgwood said.  
Only after this agreement would work start on the expansion. Besides Woodside and Shell, the other equal partners in the Shelf are The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Chevron Inc and a partnership of Mitsui & Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp.
Shell and Chevron are also partners in Gorgon along with U.S. oil giants Texaco Inc and Mobil Corp.",0
"The growth of the Internet has created the biggest creative explosion in the history of the computing world, said Sun Microsystems Inc chairman Scott McNealy on Friday.
""It is only been since we unleashed the Internet that you have suddenly seen this unleashing of technology and innovation and research and a transformation,"" McNealy told Reuters in an interview.
McNealy cited the launch of the Netscape Communications Corp Navigation browser and his company's Java computer language that allows users to operate across all computer operating systems as examples of recent computer innovation.
The Internet and Java is likely to pose the biggest threat to U.S. software giant Microsoft, said McNealy, who is on a 10-day visit to Australian and New Zealand along with 2,500 Sun employees, who are in Sydney attending a sales convention.
""Its two main two sources of revenue, (Microsoft) Office (software) and the desktop operating system are under threat,"" said McNealy, who is well known for firing salvos at Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder.
Microsoft and Sun are locked in many battles across the fiercely competitive computer industry. Microsoft has annual revenues around US$8.6 billion, while Sun has revenues of US$7.00 billion a year.
McNealy said Java users could operate in all operating systems including Windows, while the Internet and Java allowed users to download word processing applications without buying Microsoft's popular Microsoft Office software.
""The Internet has forced them (Microsoft) to change their strategies,"" said the 42-year-old computer millionaire.
Microsoft unveiled plans on Thursday to relaunch its online service Microsoft Network (MSN) with a US$100 million promotion push in order to double MSN's subscriber base. But McNealy said this showed another Internet strategy shift by Microsoft.
""Do you know what the Internet has done to our business? Absolutely nothing, we haven't changed our strategy one bit,"" said McNealy, who is on his first visit to Australia.
Java, which was developed by Sun and launched in May 1995, is a language that specialises in letting a wide range of computers share information with each other through networks.
Those capabilities are in themselves a threat to dominant players like Microsoft, whose MS-DOS and family of Windows operating systems run on nearly 90 percent of the world's PCs, industry sources said.
Sun has already licenced its Java technology to most of the world's computer industry, including Microsoft.
McNealy sees no threat from selling Sun's Java technology to its competitors. ""We don't own the language, we compete by doing something better in the language. It is like trying to own the English language, you compete by what you do with the language.""
Java computers, known as Network Computers, would be launched soon, which McNealy likened to the launch of the car. The Network Computer is the third wave in the evolution of the computer, McNealy said. The first was the mainframe, with the second wave being the personal computer, he said.
""We will still have buses and trains, which work on centralised systems like the mainframe. We will still have bicycles, which are like PCs, but the preferred mode of transportation for most of us is the automobile, which will be the Network Computer,"" McNealy said.",0
"Australia's second largest telephone carrier Optus Communications rang up its first annual profit on Wednesday and is on track for its sharemarket float by the end of the year.
Optus, established at the start of 1992 to compete with Australia's main telephone carrier, state-owned Telstra Corp, reported a pre-tax profit of A$60.3 million (US$47.64 million) in the year to June 30, 1996.
This compares with a loss of A$17.0 million in 1994/95.
""After a tremendous effort during its first few years, Optus is now in a very strong position to capitalise on the many opportunities presented by the rapidly growing telecommunications industry,"" chief executive officer Zygmunt Switkowski said in a statement.
The profit was within expectations. Telecommunications analysts forecast Optus to deliver a profit before abnormals of between A$55 million and A$65 million.
""I don't think the market will be disappointed,"" said one Sydney-based analyst. ""I think the revenue is a little bit down on what they were talking about.""
The results reflected strong revenue growth of 36 percent to A$1.94 billion in 1995/96, with high revenue increases from its three main businesses of mobile telephones, long-distance calls and services to the corporate and government sector, chief operating officer Phil Jacobs said on Wednesday.
Optus, 24.5 percent owned each by U.S. BellSouth Corp and Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc, said in February it expected to achieve A$2.0 billion in revenue in 1995/96.
The Sydney-based group is still expected to make its sharemarket debut by the end of 1996, Switkowski said.
""The float's planned to occur this side of Christmas and the prospectus is progressing to plan, but it is not done,"" he told reporters after the results anouncement.
The float is expected to raise around A$1.5 billion, making it the largest telecommunications company to list on the Australian Stock Exchange, with up to 40 percent of the company shares to be listed.
Optus will later be joined by Telstra on the stock exchange.
The Australian government plans to raise A$8.0 billion from the sale of one-third of Telstra in 1997/98, which will be just after full deregulation of Australia's telecommunications industry on July 11, 1997.
Despite chalking up its first annual profit, Optus incurred increased losses from its 46.5 percent-owned pay television and local telephone call operator Optus Vision.
Optus said its share of losses from Optus Vision was A$74.0 million, which were mainly due to the start-up of the offshoot, which is spending A$3.0 billion rolling out its nationwide fibre optic cable network to provide pay TV and telephone services.
Optus Vision, which includes Australia's richest man Kerry Packer amongst its shareholders, reported a loss of A$1.54 million in 1994/95, in its first year of operation. The company has not announced its 1995/96 results.
Switkowski was coy about 1996/97 forecasts. Optus Communications was completing its prospectus for the sharemarket float, which would contain revenue and profit forecasts.
However, Switkowski predicted that revenue from its mobile telephone business would exceed revenues from its long-distance calls due to strong local demand, as Australia has one of the highest penetration rates for mobile phones in the world.",0
"Australian mineral sands and base metals miner RGC Ltd reported on Thursday that it had doubled annual operating profit for the 1995/96 year, thanks largely to a boom in demand for aircraft and golf clubs.
RGC, 40 percent owned by British conglomerate Hanson Plc, reported a 101 percent rise in operating profit to A$108.57 million (US$85.99 million) for the year ended June 30.
And it said it was on the lookout for expansion opportunities in Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and the Ukraine.
The higher profit was due to improved mineral sands demand and prices, together with a stronger tin price and output, chairman Tony Cotton told reporters on Thursday.
""It was a good result and was in line with market expectations,"" Pru-Bache Securities mining analyst Quek told Reuters. ""The mineral sands division did very well and there was an improvement in the tin business too,"" he said.
The higher mineral sands and tin prices helped lift sales 54 percent to A$986.39 million in 1995/96.
RGC, which tussles with South African miner Richards Bay Minerals for the title of the world's largest mineral sands miner, has about 30 percent of the world market for titanium dioxide (Ti02), which is used to make titanium metal.
""With Ti02 we have good news and bad news,"" RGC managing director Mark Bethwaite told reporters. ""The good news is that U.S. growth forecast is very strong, around three to four percent, and there is strong titanium metal demand particularly because of some aviation growth and also of golf clubs.
""Titanium is now a favourite material to make golf driver heads,"" Bethwaite said.
As for the bad news, Bethwaite said: ""In the U.S. and in Asia there is something of a price war going on.
""So prices are taking quite a battering,"" he said.
RGC, which has operations in Australia, the United States, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Indonesia, was also keen on expanding to other countries, including Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and the Ukraine, for mineral sands and base metal exploration, he said.
""What we are saying there is that we are ready and able to joint venture particularly with junior (small miners) and governments, where they seek a strong partner in both financial and technical capacity,"" he said.
The Sydney-based miner said it was one of three companies on the short-list to buy the tin assets of the Bolivian state-owned COMIBOL mining corp, which include a tin smelter and two mines.
""We are on the short-list for what is called the capitialisation of COMIBOL tin assets. There were four parties, there are now three, including RGC as one,"" Bethwaite said.
If RGC was successful with its tender to acquire the tin assets in the land-locked South American nation it would become one of the world's largest tin miners, he said.
RGC produced about 16,000 tonnes of tin in concentrate in the 1995/96 year. The two Bolivian tin mines up for sale would increase the group's annual tin output to over 35,000 tonnes.
The world's largest tin miner is Tambang Timah of Indonesia, which is expected to produce 41,500 tonnes in 1996.
Despite the better-than-expected profit, RGC shares rose just one cent to A$5.94 on light volume.",0
"Westpac Banking Group, the second largest bank in Australia, announced plans on Wednesday to expand its Asian activities through an alliance with British-based Standard Chartered Bank Plc.
The move signals Westpac is ready to expand in the region again after putting most of its Asian activities up for sale 3-1/2 years ago to focus on Australasia.
At the time a recession was biting deeply into profits and the share register held potential predators such as Australia's richest man Kerry Packer and Lend Lease Corp Ltd.  
Westpac chief executive Bob Joss said in a statement the deal with Standard Chartered was of major importance.
""It is a good strategic fit for our future growth,"" he said. Standard Chartered group chief executive Malcolm Williamson said his bank was committed to ""ensuring this new relationship with Westpac is of significant long term benefit to both companies"".

"Australian regional banks St George Bank Ltd and Advance Bank Australia Ltd on Monday unveiled a merger plan to create the nation's fifth largest bank with a market value of A$4.5 billion (US$3.55 billion).
""We have that golden opportunity, we are not going to miss it,"" St George Bank managing director Jim Sweeney told reporters at a joint news conference. This is the fifth merger St George has tried with different banks in the past two years.
""We are going to build a special new different bank here that will take advantage of all of things that many of us always want to do,"" said Sweeney, who will head the enlarged group.
Advance Bank shareholders would be offered a combination of A$2.10 in cash, a 20 cent special cash dividend and new St George shares up to a value of A$5.00 per Advance Bank share.
The total value of the offer was A$7.30 per Advance share, which values it at A$2.65 billion. St George would fund the offer by a mixture of cash and scrip and a new capital raising.
The friendly merger of the two Sydney-based banks would create a bank with assets of A$40 billion and make it one of Australia's top 25 listed companies.
""The Australian banking industry is currently going through a very dramatic stage, we cannot be sure what will come out the other end, but we believe this will allow us to make the most of opportunities that the market change present,"" Sweeney said.
Advance bank shares soared on the merger announcement. It closed 57 cents or nine percent higher at A$6.85, a record close. St George shares ended 40 cents or 4.5 percent lower at A$8.55, after hitting a low of A$8.30 during the day.
Australian banking analysts said that the offer was generous to Advance shareholders because it was well above prices paid in recent local banking takeovers.
Any rival bidders might be scared off entering the fray by a current official inquiry into the banking industry and an agreement, part of the merger deal, for Advance to pay A$100 million to St George if it is taken over by a third party.
""I think that would make it unattractive for somebody else to come in and make a bid,"" said Linda Lyon, banking analyst at brokers BNP Equities.
St George has been desperately seeking a friendly merger over the past two years to avoid being swallowed up itself.
The stock market viewed Australia's largest banking group, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB), as the most likely predator.
NAB holds 6.8 percent of St George although it has said it had no takeover plans for the Sydney bank.
However, in June it voted against a plan for St George to merge with Queensland based Metway Bank Ltd.
NAB declined to comment on Monday's announcement.
St George's bid for Metway was also was scuttled by the Queensland government, which trumped St George's offer with a higher bid through its wholly-owned financial services group Suncorp and the Queensland Industry and Development Corp (QIDC).
Last year, St George was also blocked by Westpac Banking Corp, one of Australia's top banks, in a takeover bid for Perth-based Challenge Bank Ltd after Westpac made a higher offer.
St George was also in talks last year to merge with the Bank of Western Australia Ltd before the Bank of Scotland Plc took control of the Perth-based bank, and with the Bank of South Australia, which was taken over by Advance in early 1995.

""The third quarter of 1996 was another landmark quarter for Netscape, as Netscape server and client software solutions made significant inroads into the global enterprise market,"" said Netscape President and Chief Executive Jim Barksdale.
Wall Street, which had been expecting Netscape to report revenues of roughly $85 million to $90 million, had not expected the company to hit the $100 million quarterly revenue milestone until the second quarter next year, analysts said.
""I think the $100 million mark really shows significdant growth,"" said Hambrecht and Quist analyst Daniel Rimer, noting revenues grew 33 percent sequentially. ""This is major league revenue for a quarter.""
The quarterly revenue was well above the $80.7 million it posted for the whole of 1995. For the first nine months, Netscape earned $12 million, or 14 cents a share, on sales of $231 million. A year earlier, the company lost $7 million, or 10 cents a share, on sales of $44 million.
In after-hours dealing, shares of Netscape were firm, changing hands as high as $44.875, up from its closing level of $44.50 in Nasdaq market trading.
Barksdale said in an interview after the results that the indirect sales through third parties such as computer makers and systems integrators had accounted for 60 percent of overall sales, and 100 percent in Europe and Asia.
""We think it's a very efficient channel for us,"" he said. ""More and more we're seeing our job as demand creation through our direct sales force. We just think it's a more efficient way for these kind of products (to be sold).""
""I'm very proud we have gotten to that as quickly, because we're very dependent on these people,"" he said.
Barksdale outlined a broad range of companies which had chosen Netscape software to build applications for their computer networks, or ""intranet"" applications.
Analysts said the rapid growth of the market will help Netscape continue to grow in competition with rivals like Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp.
Barksdale said he remained concerned that competitors will be confused by the competitive frenzy, although he said key Netscape products remain lower in price those of Microsoft and Lotus, for example.",0
"For many computer owners, 1997 will be the year when Internet users will begin to see more features aimed at making the Net more lifelike. But it is also likely to be marked by frequent communications breakdowns caused, in part, by increased demand.
""I wrote a year ago about a collapse, but it's really collapses, getting more frequent, deeper and longer,"" said Robert Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet computer networking technology and founder of 3Com Corp who is now vice president of technology at International Data Group of Boston.
Metcalfe said the congestion that causes many people to call the World Wide Web the ""World Wide Wait"" is only one of many problems that can prompt it to crash. Major outages have been caused by such seemingly minor events as a rodent chewing a power cable or an ampersand typed in the wrong place in software on central Internet devices.
This summer, more than 6 million customers of America Online Inc., the world's largest online computer service, were without service for 19 hours because of a software problem. In October, a failure at Internet service provider BBN Corp's Stanford University Internet facility cut off access for 400 top high tech firms for nearly a day.
Experts such as Metcalfe predict similar types of outages next year as telecommunications companies and Internet providers struggle to keep up with demand. Still, Web surfers are likely to see many new features in 1997, from advanced graphics to slick ways to communicate with each other using animated characters in virtual chat rooms and high-tech games.
Dozens of companies, including Germany-based Black Sun Interactive, which recently opened an operation in San Francisco, have been developing new virtual worlds based on a technology called Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML).
The technology, pronounced ""ver-mul,"" enables creators of multi-player computer games, for example, to design lifelike characters and three-dimensional settings that will exploit new 3-D computer chip designs and speeded-up microprocessors with added multimedia features due next year. New capabilities include interactive three-dimensional fly-over cities created by the startup Bigbook, which allows users to swoop down on a building and click on it with a mouse to see who is inside.
But as the Net becomes more lifelike, the prospects for a showdown between regulators and free-speech advocates over the issue of online pornography is likely to increase. In October, the FBI said it was investigating an electronic mail message sent to thousands of Internet users offering child pornography for sale.
The question of whether to regulate the content of the Internet, both within a country's borders and internationally, comes as officials in Washington are pressing for reductions in sexual and violent content in film and television. One solution offered by some software firms is a device like television's V-chip, which allows parents to restrict access to certain programmes.
Next year will also see new electronic communities in which people can participate as consumer, customer, contributor or even investor in enterprises over the Web.
Although 1997 will not be the year people rush out to do all their shopping on line, it will be a critical year for deploying the technologies that will make electronic commerce widely available in 1998 and 1999, according to analysts.
Michael Parekh, Internet analyst at Goldman Sachs, expects companies to continue using Internet technology both in internal networks, known as Intranets, and to create what are known as Extranets, to reach customers and suppliers.
""The big thing for 1997 is going to be the way users think of the Web goes from a pull paradigm to a push paradigm,"" he said, referring to the goal of being able to send data to individuals rather than waiting for them to seek it.
In the United States, only about one third of the country's 97 million households have a personal computer and just 11 percent of U.S. households are estimated to have the modem devices necessary to link them to the Internet.
Faster, 56-kilobit modems are due next year, but analysts expect a battle over standards will slow their spread.",0
"Sun Microsystems Inc said on Wednesday its profits rose 41 percent in the latest quarter and its revenues jumped to record levels, driven by sales of the company's server computer and power desktop systems.
Sun said its net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 29 rose to $178.3 million from $126 million in second quarter a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 46 cents from 32 cents.
Revenues rose nearly 19 percent to $2.08 billion.
The per share earnings beat Wall Street expectations of 42 cents, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' earnings estimates.
""The current fiscal year continues to yield strong financial results,"" Sun Microsystems Chief Financial Officer Michael Lehman said in a statement. ""Sun is winning big in corporate intranets, the Internet, and the extranet.""
So-called intranets are in-house networks modelled on the Internet, while extranets, which are secure networks outside a company, such as a private network.
Lehman said the company's investments in research and development and sales and support infrastructure were paying off as it moved to broaden its global presence.
The company said gross profit margins rose to 50.4 percent, up more than 5 percentage points from the comparable period the previous year.
Sun Microsystems Chief Executive Scott McNealy told analysts in a conference call that it was difficult to say whether the strong gross margins were sustainable.
Sun's order backlog rose to $470 million from $407 million in its first quarter, but it was still much less than the $522 million backlog at the end of its 1996 fiscal year last June.
McNealy said the company planned to announce new high-end computers, codenamed Starfire, next week as it seeks to offer computers that can be used for the most intensive corporate computing tasks, like databases and network management.
Lehman said initial market data showed Sun appeared to be taking market share from its traditional rivals, and he said Sun will continue to make further significant price cuts.
The executives said Sun was deriving increasing amounts of revenues from storage products, professional services and licensing of products based on the Java programming language, which is used to develop Internet applications.",0
"Wired magazine remains one of the publishing world's hottest 1990s startups, but on the brink of its parent's initial stock offering some analysts are warning the chronicle of the digerati of the Internet age may prove a better read than investment.
""It's a great read, off Wall Street, but the balance sheet is not quite as neo-designed as the magazine,"" said Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst at Mecklermedia's iWORLD.
The initial public offering of Wired Ventures Inc., the publisher of the magazine, were due to be priced late on Thursday, according to lead underwriter Goldman Sachs.
The offering had been initially due in July but was pulled at the last minute as the market for technology and Internet stocks was tumbling.
Now Internet stocks, most of which have only gone public since the Netscape Communication Corp.'s milestone offering in August 1995, have rebounded nearly 10 percent from their July lows.
Wired Ventures' revised offering has reduced the company's projected market capitalisation by some $200 million, or 42 percent, from its initial plan, according to Harmon, who calculated the company's new market capitalisation at some $300 million based on an IPO price of $13 a share.
Wired intends to sell up to 4.75 million shares at a range of $12 to $14 a share to raise gross proceeds of $61.75 million. This compares with its earlier plan to raise $76 million from sale of 6.3 million shares.
IPO analysts said the company was wise to hold off on its initial offering, enabling it to take advantage of the current pickup in new share offerings coming to market.
Some Internet analysts also said the offering faces a market that is becoming more discerning than in the past, when investors snapped up shares of companies which had minimal operating history and little promise of near-term profits.
""I think they're going to have a little bit of a challenge with this one. It's just fundamentals,"" said one analyst. ""A couple of years ago, when the Internet was just starting, you could have taken your dog named 'Net' public.""
Many investors and analysts compare Wired with traditional print media, since some 90 percent of its revenues are still derived from its high-tech monthly, which since 1993 has been promoted as the magazine of the digital revolution.
Early investors in Wired have included high tech guru Nicholas Negroponte, who heads the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Labs, and publisher S.I. Newhouse.
Wired continues to be among the fastest-growing publishing properties, growing in circulation from 90,000 at the end of 1993, its first year of publication, to an estimated 325,000 in August, according to the company's offering documents.
The company also runs HotWired, a hip Web site geared for those who want to keep on the leading edge of digital developments, and the search engine HotBot.
But IPO experts note the business plan for the Internet operations was still in early development and the company continues to post heavy losses, with a net loss for the first six months of 1996 of $34.7 million, including a $20.5 million writeoff, more than double its revenues of $15.63 million.
At an expected price of some 7.3 times estimated 1996 revenues, the valuation would be cheaper than recent Internet content companies like CNET Inc., which has traded at 20 times 1996 revenues, or Yahoo! Inc., which has been trading at more than 40 times estimated 1996 revenues.
But this is pricey compared to more conventional print media valuations, where two times revenues is often the norm, and four to five times for properties exhibiting strong growth in an otherwise maturing sector, analysts said.
""Wired changed journalism, especially high-tech journalism, and made it cool,"" said Harmon, adding that investors may have difficulty valuing this in financial terms.
""I think Wired expected everybody to just assume it was the emperor emeritus of the digital world and that everything they did turned to gold,"" he said.",0
"Netscape Communications Corp. stock was battered for the second time in less than a week on Tuesday following cautionary comments by a Wall Street analyst regarding the Internet software company.
Merrill Lynch analyst Bruce Smith said in a research note that Netscape had scrambled to make its fourth-quarter goals in a way that could hurt its current first quarter and the outlook for all of 1997.
Netscape stock tumbled more than 10 percent, dropping $4.50 to $42.25 on the Nasdaq market on volume of more than 6.5 million shares. The stock was one of the most actively traded on the exchange.
The stock of the Mountain View, Calif.-based company has lost more than a quarter of its value since the end of 1996, including a drop of around 19 percent after another analysts' warning last Wednesday.
Smith said he remained neutral on the stock but cited industry sources as saying Netscape had scrambled to meet its fourth-quarter numbers at the end of 1996, which he said did not bode well for its current quarter and all of 1997.
""They closed a significant amount of business on Dec. 31 just to make the quarter, which they've never had to do before,"" he said. In his research note, Smith wrote, ""We have heard of two major deals that were closed on Dec. 31, one of which apparently closed late in the evening.""
But a spokeswoman for Netscape rebutted this.
Speaking after the market closed, she said the company did complete some of its deals toward the end of the quarter, but she denied it was pushing down to the wire to lock up deals that would make a major impact on its financial results.
""We did no deals that were of materially significance on Dec. 31,"" she said.
""Sure, we did deals towards the end of the quarter, like everyone does,"" the spokeswoman added.
Last Wednesday, the stock tumbled after Deutsche Morgan Grenfell analyst William Gurley cut his rating on the stock to ""accumulate"" from ""buy"" and cited risks from its transition to a new business plan and new pricing.
Several other analysts, including Goldman Sachs's Michael Parekh and Morgan Stanley & Co.'s Mary Meeker, have put ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" ratings on the stock, recognising near-term risks but remaining upbeat on the stock in the longer term.",0
"Even before the personal computer era's foremost figures donned togas and circus suits for the traditional extravaganzas of the industry's annual gala summit, industry titans were jockeying for the limelight.
Although the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor is among the high points of this year's show, the next 25 years of the industry are likely to prove even more fast-paced, and bitterly competitive, according to senior executives.
The week promises a flurry of new products -- and whole new categories of products ranging from hand-held Windows PCs to new species of the controversial new Network Computer to fast new computer modems and the launch of DVD, digital video disk.
The latter technology holds many times the amount of data available on the conventional CD-ROM devices which now come as standard on many desktops, and is likely to appear next year on machines ranging from laptops to home theatre televisions.
Not only will people be able to play full-length movies on their laptop devices, but the new medium is expected to unleash a whole new genre of computer games using sophisticated three dimensional animation and hot new 3-D computer chips.
Although the annual event is prone to hyperbole -- and it is expected to draw nearly a quarter of a million executives, analysts, customers and media people this year -- some high- profile executives believe the time has finally arrived for the long-heralded convergence of television, computers and telecommunications into one vast, interconnected business.
""I think this convergence is starting to redefine itself as collision,"" Carl Wankowski, president and chief operating officer of Sony Electronics Inc., the U.S. operating unit of Sony Corp. told Reuters on the eve of the show.
Sony expects to showcase a variety of products, including DVD technologies and its WebTV set-top box, which turns a television into a simplified Internet browsing device.
The opening keynote of the week-long event will be Intel Corp. Chief Executive Andy Grove, who under the theme ""A Revolution in Progress,"" will trace the history of the microprocessor which turned Intel from a fledgling chip company into the world's largest semiconductor company.
Grove will also provide live demonstrations of how personal computers can already be used for sophisticated applications today for complex graphics displays. He will outline goals and challenges facing the PC industry over the next 15 years, with projections for the next quarter century.
On Tuesday, Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates promises to issue a challenge to the industry in a keynote speech whose title harkens back to Gates' ""Information at Your Fingertips"" address here six years ago.
Gates, who recently republished his book, ""The Road Ahead,"" in paperback, has said the industry is too optimistic about what it can produce within a short, two-year time frame, but far too pessimistic about what can be achieved in a decade.
Netscape Communications Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jim Barkesdale on Wednesday will make the third of a trio of keynotes that day, providing insight on how the pioneer of Web browsers sees competition moving to internal corporate networks based on Internet technology, known as intranets.
But the celebrations begin already on Sunday night, as International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp. officially launches its SmartSuite 97 for Windows 95 and Windows NT at a lavish gathering to be followed by IBM's famous Toga Party.
Microsoft Corp. is due to unveil the Handheld PC (HPC) devices running its Windows CE consumer electronics version of its system at a Treasure Island Hotel bash complete with a Cirque du Soleil performance.
A handful of major computer companies, including Compaq Computer Corp., NEC Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., are due to unveil mobile Windows CE-based handheld devices.
On Monday, Microsoft is due to show off the master version of its lastest productivity suite Office 97, enabling a direct comparison between its offering and Smartsuite 97.
Apple Computer Inc., still seeking to recover from huge losses over the last year, is expected to counter the Windows CE launch with more industry-focused adaptations of its three-year-old Newton handheld technology.
The company may also seize the opportunity to provide more details of its future technology plans, as rumours continue to swirl over discussions it has had with startup Be Inc., which has been working on a speedy new operating system.",0

"An outspoken computer security expert, citing his just-completed study, says up to two-thirds of certain Web sites, including reputable institutions like banks and the media, are vulnerable to hacker attacks.
Dan Farmer -- who stirred controversy in 1995 as co-author of software dubbed SATAN that enables people with basic skills to infiltrate computer systems -- surveyed more than 2,200 Web sites.
The survey released last week covered a relatively small portion of the sprawling Web but focused on sites where security is more of a concern.
Farmer probed 660 bank sites around the globe, 312 North American online newspaper sites, 274 credit union sites, 47 U.S. federal government sites and 451 Internet sex clubs.
In a summary, Farmer said that, out of his sample of about 1,700 Web sites he selected, ""over 60 percent could be broken into or destroyed."" As a control, he probed a random sample of 469 sites.
Farmer said he used relatively crude, non-intrusive methods and did not actually break into the sites. He also said he would not publish the names of the sites he surveyed.
""I barely electronically breathed on these (computer) hosts,"" he said in his report, adding that, considering more intrusive tests, some 70 percent to 80 percent of sites may have security flaws.
Other computer security experts found Farmer's results credible and authoritative, David Kennedy, director of research, education and consulting at the National Computer Security Association, said in a telephone interview Monday.
Experts and computer industry executives said the study shed more light on a problem well known within the industry but insufficiently understood by the public at large.
The threat of hacker attacks was highlighted earlier this year when intruders broke into the Justice Department and Central Intelligence Agency Web sites and altered them, prompting the CIA to close its site temporarily.
Farmer stressed that Web sites are being used primarily for marketing and advertising purposes and that, although some bank sites may allow visitors to look up balances, the sites do not provide access to internal financial systems.
Deborah Triant, president of CheckPoint Software Technologies Ltd.'s U.S. operating unit in Redwood City, Calif., said banks routinely keep Web sites on separate computer systems.
""Our experience is the banks are so paranoid that they won't even allow the access that they should be able to allow and would be quite safe if you had a modern firewall"" protecting their networks from intruders, said Triant, whose company is the market leader in firewall technology.
""So, if their Web site is vulnerable, that doesn't mean that anything else at the bank is vulnerable, or that their customers' accounts or the transactions their customers are doing are vulnerable,"" she said.
Nevertheless, with the advent of electronic commerce over the Internet expected to gain momentum in 1997, lax security remains a critical issue, experts said.
Farmer separated security flaws into two categories -- a red category where he said a site was ""essentially wide open to any potential attacker"" and a yellow category deemed less serious but with potential for disastrous consequences.
Of the 660 bank sites, 68 percent were deemed vulnerable and nearly 36 percent were in the red category.
Some 51 percent of credit unions were vulnerable, 62 percent of the federal sites, nearly 70 percent of newpapers and 66 percent of sex clubs. Sites in the red category ranged from 20 percent for credit unions to 38 percent for federal sites and 39 percent for online newspapers.
Of the random sample of 469 Web sites used as the control, a far smaller percentage -- 33 percent -- were found to be vulnerable, and 17 percent of the group was in the red category.
Farmer said part of the problem is that Web sites are trying to do too much at once, increasing their complexity and making security far more difficult to achieve.
But, even with security concerns, credit card transactions over the Net are much safer than those carried out in shopping malls, said the security association's Kennedy.
Farmer also said he plans to incorporate some newer testing tools into a new version of SATAN, which stands for Security Administrator Tool for Analysing Networks, early next year.
The programme enables people who manage corporate networks to locate weaknesses and fix them. But it has been controversial because it can also easily be used by malevolent intruders trying to cause damage.
Triant said there have been no reported security breaches at any of the more than 15,000 institutions with CheckPoint network security installed and said such precautions should provide adequate protection.",0
"U.S. high-tech venture fund investment soared 50 percent in the third quarter as overall U.S. venture investment rose 25 percent in the seasonally-slow period from year-ago levels, according to a survey released on Friday.
""It is so hot it's scary,"" Kirk Walden, who compiles the quarterly Price Waterhouse LLP National Venture Capital Survey, said in an interview.
High-technology industries, from computer software and semiconductors to medical instruments, rose to $1.32 billion in the third quarter, accounting for two-thirds of the $2 billion invested during the period, the survey found.
Software investments alone more than doubled from year-ago levels to $596 million, and in the first nine months of 1996 alone reached $1.74 billion, more than the $1.34 billion recorded for the sector in all of 1995.
For the first nine months of 1996, total venture-backed investments in the country reached $7 billion, nearly the $7.5 billion reported for the full year last year.
""Based on the current rate of venture capital investments, 1996 will certainly be another record year,"" Donald McGovern, chairman of the Price Waterhouse Technology Industry Group, said in a statement accompanying the results.
The third quarter total figure of $2 billion was a sequential drop from the blistering $2.8 billion pace the industry recorded in the second quarter.
""Third-quarter numbers are traditionally lower than second- quarter numbers because deal flow slows considerably in the summer months,"" said Carl Thoma, president of the National Venture Capital Association. ""But the venture capital industry still remains strong. Good deals are being made across the country in all industries.
Companies in the startup and early stages attracted the greatest level of venture capital investment, the study found, with these comprising 46 percent of the 444 companies receiving funds and accounting for $600 million invested.
On average startup companies received more than $3.1 million in funding and, communications firms accounted for nearly 56 percent of the total invested in this category.
Funding for Internet-related companie continued at the high level set in the second quarter of 1996, with 62 Internet- related companies receiving funding in the quarter exeeding the year-ago period by six times.
In a new trend, third quarter venture investment activity appeared to expand beyond the traditionally dominant Silicon Valley and New England areas, whose combined share of investment fell to 33 percent of value invested.
Typically the two regions account for some 40 to 45 percent of the total amount invested by venture funds, and experts said it confirms atriend towards more even distribution.
""Nobody in Silicon Valley is going to panic,"" because of the increase in funding outside the key areas, Walden said.",0
"Sun Microsystems Inc's newly launched Javastation network computer is its first machine to compete directly with low-end personal computers, but analysts aren't expecting runaway sales just yet.
""Maybe a couple of years from now it will begin competing with low-end PCs,"" said Evan Quinn, an analyst at International Data Corp, noting Sun's network computing strategy is tied to future expansion of its Java technology.
An entry-level NC will be available in December.  
Earlier Tuesday, the Mountain View, Calif.-based provider of network computing products and powerful workstations, introduced the JavaStation, a scaled-down PC designed to access corporate networks and the Internet, with an entry price of $742.
The company said the entry-level model would contain eight megabytes of memory and will ship beginning in December. A fully configured system, which includes memory, a keyboard, a mouse and fourteen-inch monitor will ship for $995.  
Sun officials are hoping the device will appeal to corporate clients looking to cut their costs for upgrading and maintaining office PC's.
However, given the entry of long-time NC doubter Microsoft Corp into the market with plans for a light version of its Windows operating system, the market will be hotly contested.
International Business Machines Corp launched its first NC model last month.  
Redwood City, Calif.-based Oracle Corp, which has been beating the drum for creating a new NC standard for 18 months, is leading a further effort to build network computers for broader markets.
""This is just beginning to heat up and could potentially start getting very interesting,"" one analyst said of the brewing slugfest between computer industry titans.
Sun Microsystems's machines are more highly targeted than many of its adversaries', however, and it has linked them together with a Java-centric model of future computing.  
Java, a hot new technology introduced by Sun in May 1995 as a programming language initially, has since been expanded into a whole computing architecture for both hardware and software as Sun moved aggressively to proliferate its use.
Sun has licensed Java to the suppliers of nearly all major computer operating systems, including Microsoft and its popular Windows operating systems. One of Java's most compelling features is that it can be used across rival systems.  
This feature should enable software developers in the future to write one version of their software that could work on nearly all systems, known as ""write once, play anywhere.""
Initially, the market will be to replace very basic computer terminals, such as IBM's 3270 terminals or IBM AS/400 midrange character-based terminals, in very simple, dedicated functions such as entering data into a company's network.
International Data Corp projects there are ""a couple of million"" such terminals in use currently, and perhaps as many as 10 million personal computers used for such activities.  
The market for the NC is likely to build sales gradually, according to IDC, which expects a million to be sold around the world in 1997, still dwarfed by the tens of millions of personal computers sold annually.
Some industry analysts have questioned whether the NC will ever really catch on, and many believe it will not do so for at least some 18 months or so, by which time Sun's partners should be producing microprocessors optimized for Java.
Ed Zander, president of Sun Microsystems Computer Company, said in an interview that Sun realistically expects acceptance to be a gradual process, but to lead to a new computing epoch.
""We worked long and hard about not just producing a cheap box, but (also addressing the question) 'How does that box work in a corporate environment?',"" he said. ""'How do you administer it? How do manage it? How do you develop it? How do you deploy it?'""
He acknowledges Sun's approach produced a system that is ""markedly different"" from the NCs that Oracle and IBM are talking about, or even that of Microsoft's NetPC.
Sun is targeting cost savings, claiming large organizations can reduce the three-year cost of ownership using its Java systems to around $7,500, or as much as one fifth of three-year networkedPC costs projected at up to $36,000.",0

"Microsoft Corp Wednesday launched electronic commerce software and a wide array of partners aimed at enabling consumers and businesses to buy and sell products over the World Wide Web.
At the core of the announcement is Microsoft's Merchant Server, software which will enable businesses to set up electronic storefronts on the Internet, and a plan to build a new channel of service providers to help businesses do this.
Analysts said the strategy was similar to that successfully used by Novell Inc to sell networking software.
""We believe there will be explosive growth (in use of the Web for shopping),"" Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Gates said at a news conference unveiling the company's electronic commerce strategy.
Microsoft also revealed 40 companies that are in the process of building Merchant Server sites and Henry Vigil, general manager of electronic commerce services at Microsoft, said he expects 300 sites using the software by year-end.
The product competes with an array of prior offerings, including those of Netscape Communications Corp and Internet startup Open Market, as well as Oracle Corp and International Business Machines Corp.
As part of the deal, Microsoft and VeriFone Inc brought together financial institutions and payment processors to provide a secure Internet retailing and payment system.
The financial institutions involved include BankAmerica Corp, Wells Fargo & Co, Citicorp's Citibank Card Acceptance Europe, First USA Paymenteck Inc, NOVUS Services and Royal Bank of Canada.
Much of the technology was made available to partners for testing in August and was developed by eShop, which Microsoft acquired in June, company officials said.
In addition to the infrastructure partners, Vigil said a key priority was ""trying to get this new channel built where we see a range of hosting service providers who are really going to be the ones who lease the T1 lines and run the servers on behalf of merchants who are not technologists.""
One such company, Boca Raton, Fl.-based Internet Communication Network, Corp., has been in business less than a year and already has some 50 customer Web sites in operation, including one using the Merchant Server, according to David Finkelstein, president of ICA.
James Dee, a specialist New York City photographer, said he had chosen to go through a networking service and support firm using the Merchant Server product to start up a new gallery to sell original contemporary artwork on the Web.
The site was set up in less than a month, he said, and Sarala Dee said the cost of getting the cyberspace gallery under way would amount to some $30,000 to $40,000.
But analysts said the market still may take a long time to develop into the multi-billion dollar market some Internet enthusiasts project.
""As Gates said clearly this is a beginning market,"" said Kathey Hale, an analyst at Dataquest.
Gates cited Microsoft and industry estimates that the number of consumers on the World Wide Web would more than triple between now and the year 2000, to 48 million.
The number of businesses on the Web is projected to grow four-fold by the year 2000 to two million from 500,000 currently, Gates said.
David Cuursey, who publishes the Coursey.com newsletter on the Internet, said estimates the minimum price for a decent store using the software is $100,000.
""The point of it is that for a lot of people setting up a virtual store it will be also as expensive to create and maintain as a real store,"" he said. ""You're not going to use this technology to take advantage of it for less than $100,000.""",0
"A Silicon Valley company has developed a new technology designed to turn the World Wide Web from a random, hit-or-miss quest into a highly targeted personal service that it says can change to suit your mood.
The new service, known as The Angle, is available immediately as a showcase for Los Altos, Calif.-based BroadVision Inc.'s One-to-One technology for personalizing the World Wide Web.
The technology enables a person to set up an individual profile, or ""angle,"" combining personal interests and preferred style to customise the ""look and feel"" of the Web service.
Users can also chose from several ""personalities"" to try out different ways of viewing information on the Internet, or choose different profiles for different moods -- such as one for the business day and another for use at home.
""We give the user the remote control,"" Broadvision said in materials prepared for the formal unveiling Tuesday of The Angle site, at the URL  http://www.theangle.com.
""We put you in the driver's seat. As you change, so do your information needs,"" the company said.
Use of the site is free of charge and requires no registration. Profiling information is stored only for the benefit of users, the company said, to ensure privacy and enable them to change their profile at any time.
Pehong Chen, the founder, president and chief executive of BroadVision, said the technology would serve not only as a showcase, but would enable large organisations to develop co-branded sites based on the BroadVision product.
""Seeing is believing,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""People can choose a personality, somebody they can relate to, or disguise themselves as sombody else ... This makes it fun and easy to understand.""
Chen said the company is targeting a Global 1000 list of large companies for developing both co-branded services and for using the technology internally in private networks known as Intranets to communicate with individual employees.
It has already begun collaborating with Web partners and formed a new division, the Content Services Group, to provide software products, consulting services and original content for both consumers and consumer-oriented businesses.
The Angle is the first application developed by the group, which is also releasing a Web-based distributed multi-user Intranet application called WebPoint, which handles calendar, workflow and communications among publishers and editorial staff involved in creating and maintaining Web sites.
Editors in the group also provide a Web Site rating system which can point users to sites with a ""Look Before You Link"" feature providing data on how easy a site is to use, its graphics intensity, level of innovation and interactivity and update frequency before even entering the site.
BroadVision has signed a charter co-branding partnership agreement with Virgin Communications of London. Branded as ""The Virgin Angle"", the service will include additional UK perspectives and is due to be available in the fourth quarter.
The new division is also advising Minneapolis-based Netradio Networks on ""The Netradio Angle,"" which is designed to be a music Web site recomendation service.
BroadVision completed an initial public offering of stock in June and Chen said the company is currently ahead of its business plan.",0
"In the true spirit of the lightning-fast world of the Internet, the browser wars which peaked in late summer have now been replaced by the battle for delivering content efficiently over the Web.
The coming months will see an intensifying battle between products that deliver information directly to a computer, rather than stumbling around looking for it with often lengthy and cumbersome Web addresses.
The competition centers on transforming the Internet from a ""pull"" model, in which people actively search the Web for information or use software agents to do that for them, to a ""push"" model, in which people can choose once what they want to be sent and it is published to them continuously.
""Everybody knows who they want to get information from. The real problem is: When is it that they have information that I care about?"" said Eli Barkat, chief executive of BackWeb Technologies, a San Jose, Calif.-based start-up.
""What people want is to build relationships,"" he said.
Vivek Ranadive, president of Reuters Holdings Plc's Tibco Inc. unit, likens the initial enthusiasm for surfing the Net to Sunday drives in the early days of the automobile, a pleasant but passing phenomenon.
Electronic commerce over the Internet, which is expected to gather steam in 1997, requires a more efficient way of navigating the information superhighway, executives say.
More than a dozen companies, mostly small high-tech start-ups, have been busily seeking to define the space, much as search engines like Yahoo Inc., Infoseek Corp., Excite Inc. and Lycos Inc. have done in helping people search out what they want.
""As it was for search engines six months or a year ago, this is an area that has been more or less discovered by venture capitalists and others as something that has to be dealt with,"" said Jack Wilson, managing editor of Technologic Partners' ComputerLetter.
In addition to the impracticality of aiming to find real-time information in the more than 50 million Web pages that search engines catalog, many companies would like to be able to update customers and suppliers directly.
""There are some obvious problems with today's browse-and-pull technique for getting at information when you need it,"" Wilson said. ""So there is a proliferation of new companies and new products from old companies aimed at solving this.""
More than a dozen companies are now vying for attention, including Ex Machina, which is providing a wireless news alerting system made by Global Village Communication Inc., and New York City-based Ifusion Com.
So far, the category has been dominated by one pioneering entry, Cupertino, Calif.-based PointCast Network, which burst onto the scene in the spring with a screen saver display which offers customized and updated news, data and advertising.
""The biggest application that's got the visibility with this type of technology is PointCast,"" said Phil White, chief executive of Informix Software Inc.. ""PointCast has got everybody now aware of how I can subscribe to things.""
Another hot Silicon Valley start-up in the sector is Marimba Inc., founded by Kim Polese and three colleagues from the Sun Microsystems Inc. team which created the popular new Java programming language.
Industry executives say competition is vital to expanding the marketplace, but it also creates confusion as companies vie for a share of the action.
""I think there's a lot of confusion in the market,"" said Barkat. ""You hear a lot of names when people talk about this space, and the reason is the space is huge.""
Technologies that transform the way information is delivered on the Web, such as those which Tibco Inc. will announce Monday, may help expand the market, according to industry analysts and executives.
""We are essentially a plumbing company, so we do plumbing software, and people like Marimba and BackWeb and PointCast can actually make use of our software,"" said Ranadive.
""Now the technology they presently use to do this is a pull technology and so you can emulate a push by going out and asking a lot of questions,"" he added. ""But you're tying up the network, you're tying up the server by doing that.""",0
"Lotus Development Corp. Chief Executive Officer Michael Zisman said Wednesday the company will focus its attention on what could become a $1 billion market for collaborative Internet software by 1999.
Lotus, acquired by International Business Machines Corp. last year in a deal valued at more than $3 billion, should not try to be all things to all people, he said, but to concentrate its core business of software for groups, or so-called groupware.
""Collaboration is clearly our sweet spot,"" he said in a keynote address at a three-day Internet & Electronic Commerce conference here organised by the Gartner Group.
A new version of the company's popular Lotus Notes software due out in the fourth quarter, version 4.5, will offer Notes server software to host collaboration over the Internet. Servers are computers that manage the flow of data in a network.
This latter feature is provided by new Lotus technology dubbed Domino, which is currently being tested.
Zisman said too much attention was now devoted to browsers, software that lets users help navigate the Internet.
""The browser market is being eclipsed by the server market today as we speak,"" he said, noting browsers will most likely be offered as part of the operating system, as with Windows.
""The action, I believe, is going to be in the server market,"" he said, adding that server software for collaboration through Internet sites alone is projected to be a $1 billion market by the end of the decade.
The market for servers at the hub of Web sites will likely segment into at least three distinct classes -- content, collaboration and commerce -- and larger organisations will likely mix ""best of breed"" applications from different suppliers, he said.
Lotus Development is concentrating helping people work together electronically, he said, because ""content without collaboration is useless ... the value is not in the content.""
He noted as an example Web sites which not only carried information, but enabled people to communicate interactively with the Web site or other individuals using the Internet.
""The borders are blurry. I don't believe that we will see pure content sites and I don't believe that we will see pure commerce sites,"" he said. ""We will obtain and retain customers if we engage them.""",0
"For managers at the trendy specialty juicer Odwalla Inc., the revelation that their apple juice products were associated with a potentially deadly outbreak of E. coli food poisoning has come as a shock.
The company, headquartered in the easy-going coast community of Half Moon Bay, was founded 16 years ago on the premise that fresh, natural fruit juices nourish the spirit.
Company executives were morose as they met reporters for the first time on Thursday in the parking lot of the company's modest building, across a creek from the town center.
""It is very tough, to be honest, to be focused on health and nutrition all of your life and have this incident happen,"" Greg Steltenpohl said. He founded the business with a childhood friend in Santa Cruz in 1980, using a used juicing machine in a shed behind their house.
Odwalla has grown by more than 40 percent a year, with annual sales in its fiscal year to Aug. 31, 1996, surging 65 percent to $59.2 million. It is now estimated to account for more than 70 percent of the fresh-juice market in the seven Western states it serves, together with Vancouver, British Columbia.
The company prides itself on using cold processing, which it says leaves vegetable and other biological nutrients intact, and on a rapid store distribution system. Its marketing emphasizes freshness and the absence of pasteurization and artificial additives or preservatives.
Even its name, from a song poem by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group, displays a sense of mission. The Odwalla is a leader who guided the ""lost people of the sun"" out of the ""gray haze"" -- of ""overprocessed foods"" in this case.
Steltenpohl and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Williamson said Odwalla had mobilized its 175 trucks and drivers, armed with hand-held computers, to recover recalled bottles from the shelves of more than 4,600 outlets in California, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas and Vancouver.
Executives immediately offered to refund the purchase price of any of the company's drinks, even those not among the 16 out of 23 fruit varieties recalled. They also said the company would pay for medical treatment for anyone found to have become ill through drinking an Odwalla product.
Although Williamson said the company had product liability insurance that he believed would cover the incident, the executives declined to answer questions about the financial impact of the recall and any subsequent actions.
Odwalla shares were up $1.13 at $13.25 by Friday afternoon after shedding roughly a third of their value on Thursday.
Jean-Michel Valette, an analyst at Hambrecht & Quist, said publicity surrounding the recall would hurt sales but with insurance and $14 million in cash, ""Odwalla has the resources to weather the storm.""
Odwalla, which takes the precaution of keeping samples of each batch of juice it produces, is working with the Food and Drug Administration and Washington state authorities to determine how contamination might have occurred and how widespread it was.
But company officials said it was too soon to question their philosophy.",0
"Silicon Valley executives and venture capitalists are turning into political sharks, spending millions of dollars to defeat a California ballot measure that they claim threatens American capitalism and could send stock prices reeling.
Normally the region, which is the birthplace of such industry stalwarts as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Intel Corp., is more obsessed with Internet software tools and microchips than with politics.
But so widespread is the fear that California's Proposition 211 could make the state a haven for shareholder lawsuits that once politically neutral executives have been jolted into action -- hanging anti-211 banners on buildings and encouraging employees to vote against the initiative.
Proposition 211 is a far-reaching measure that would eliminate certain safeguards and immunity currently given corporate officers and staff members. For instance, it would hold them liable if they made projections about future results and they turned out to be wrong.
Opponents of the measure fear that corporate officers would stop making any projections about how their business was doing, making it more difficult to make investment decisions and leading to a decline in share prices.
Proponents argue it will help victims of fraud recover losses. Opponents charge it is an ""insidious"" bid by securities lawyers to line their own pockets.
There were signs the campaign against 211 could affect the outcome. A Los Angeles Times poll published Friday found 52 percent of likely voters now oppose it, up 10 percentage points from a similar Times poll five weeks ago.
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt has urged California voters to reject the measure, warning it would use the state's legal system to roll back the federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act passed last year.
""California state courts could become a magnet for class action suits,"" he wrote in a letter of opposition.
Both President Bill Clinton and Republican presidential rival Bob Dole have come out against the measure and a recent study said its passage could result in a loss of up to 1.8 million jobs and a $102 billion drop in U.S. domestic output.
The study, by trade economist Clyde Prestowitz, also projected a subsequent rise in ""frivolous lawsuits"" could result in as much as a 24 percent drop in stock market prices.
This, he concluded, ""would far outweigh the 4 cents per dollar compensation, or less, that shareholders would receive from settlements and judgments"" under the measure.
High-tech companies are considered more vulnerable to shareholder suits because their stocks typically are owned by demanding investors seeking fastest-growing companies, which can make their stock prices more volatile.
A recent survey by the American Electronics Association of its members found nearly half would consider leaving the state if 211 passes. Some economists estimated it would eliminate 150,000 jobs and cost $1.3 billion in California alone.
Even companies outside California, like International Business Machines Corp. and software giant Microsoft Corp. have opposed the measure, concerned that a single California shareholder could bring suit against them.
If it passes, high tech leaders like venture capitalist John Doerr, who is leading the $30 million-plus battle against 211, and Cypress Semiconductor Chief Executive T.J. Rodgers, have said they expect outside company directors to quit.
""If it passes, my net worth, my house, will be on the line,"" Rodgers said at a recent public debate on the issue here. ""It's a sleazy trick,"" he added.
Proponents of 211, including lawyers who bring shareholder lawsuits and stand to benefit directly from it, said they drew up the measure after a business-led initiative in the spring was opposed by nearly 60 percent of California voters.
""Americans are disgusted by corporate greed,"" said Richard Alexander, an attorney speaking in favour of the measure recently. ""People are angry about massive layoffs.""
But in Northern California, where high tech businesses have thrived, executives said the proposition was more geared to forcing corporations to settle shareholder suits up front.",0
"A fast-selling product that allows grannies all across America to exchange electronic mail securely with their families may become a key weapon in challenging the U.S. government's tight encryption policies.
Computer industry executives said the strong encryption which startup USWeb Networks is delivering on hundreds of thousands of television-based Internet browsing devices is still prohibited from export by U.S. Cold War munitions laws.
Executives at Palo Alto, Calif.-based WebTV said they chose to use the strongest coding standard available to give consumers the assurance their communications would be kept confidential.
""The only way we felt we could guarantee the level of security we felt was uncrackable by anyone...was if we were essentially using CIA-class security procedures,"" said Steve Perlman, co-founder and chief executive of WebTV Networks.
WebTV uses 128-bit encryption, based on coded 'keys' with 128 characters of information, the same level of coding used in some of the most secretive U.S. government communications.
""It's very similar to what they use when they're communicating with cruise missiles,"" Perlman said.
This is a useful fact to point out in reassuring potential customers they can both communicate and pay for goods and services securely over the Internet, he added.
""They love it. They really love it, beause now they can just relax and forget about it,"" he said. Using a credit card number over WebTV's encrypted communications is safer than reading it over a telephone, which can be tapped, he argues.
""While the FBI can get your credit card that way (over the telephone), they can't get it through WebTV,"" he said.
Perhaps equally excited about the decision by WebTV to use such strong encryption is the Silicon Valley high tech business community, which has been deadlocked in a battle with the Clinton administration over encryption restrictions.
Laws against the export of encryption date back to the start of the Cold War, when earlier versions of coding were considered vital to national security and were classified as munitions explicitly barred from export.
Top computer executives now say the use of encryption in relatively normal, consumer-oriented applications such as WebTV is a perfect example why they feel the government's efforts to restrict the technology should ultimately fail.
""Without commenting specifically on WebTV, I can tell you that the government is fighting essentially a losing battle here,"" said Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun Microsystems Inc.
""What's happened is that the technology is now so ubiquitous and there are so many people using it that the current law...really needs to be scrapped.""
In addition to the need for U.S. businesses to have strong encryption to secure their own systems when operating overseas, the computer industry argues that competitors in other countries are being given an open market to sell higher levels of encryption U.S. companies are barred from selling.
But Washington insists that law enforcement authorities must have a means of breaking into encoded messages to investigate criminal activity.
The Administration recently offered a compromise where companies could export modestly strong 'keys,' less powerful than those used by WebTV, as long as they could be recovered by authorities to crack codes after obtaining a court warrant.
Industry is not pleased with the idea.
It would be difficult, and unduly expensive, to administer and is unlikely to be acceptable to foreign customers who might not consider the U.S. government to have a right to break into their confidential communications, many argue.
""Our personal view is that the notion of key recovery is something that's not going to be very acceptable, particularly to other countries -- the notion that the U.S. government would be able to recover the keys,"" said Deborah Triant, chief executive of Check Point Software Technologies, Inc.
In the meantime, however, WebTV will be prohibited except by special license from exporting its devices, which are being sold by consumer electronics manufacturers Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics NV through retail stores.
In fact, the issue came to light publicly following a letter from one of the manufacturers to its distributors, warning not to export the machines due to the munitions laws.
""It would definitely be unfortunate if sombedy was to carry one over the border,"" said Perlman, adding the WebTV boxes have more computing power than the world's most powerful supercomputer -- Cray Reasearch's XMP-48 -- did in 1987.
""That was a $50 million computer in 1987. This is a $300 computer and it outperforms the Cray,"" he said.
WebTV has attracted investments from Microsoft Corp. and a unit of US West Inc..
""This WebTV is the first of many we're going to see where legitimate customers really do need very strong encryption for things involving really normal day-to-day use,"" said Schmidt.",0
"The semiconductor industry said Monday its key indicator rose last month to the highest level in almost a year, reflecting a surge in new orders for computer chips.
The so-called book-to-bill ratio, which measures the value of new orders compared with shipments over a trailing three-month period, jumped to 1.10 in October from a revised 0.98 in September, marking the first time it has been over 1 since December 1995.
The index, widely regarded as a sign of the computer industry's health, means that manufacturers received $110 in new orders for every $100 in shipments.
The Semiconductor Industry Association said new chip orders in October rose 17.9 percent to $3.84 billion while shipments increased by 5 percent from the previous month to $3.39 billion.
Analysts said the surge was likely a one-time phenomenon as vendors sought to catch up with increasing demand after having pared back inventories sharply early in the year when prices of memory chips in particular were tumbling.
""These strong numbers for new orders in the Americas market should reinforce our industry's cautious optimism for a solid fourth quarter,"" said Douglas Andrey, director of Information Systems and Finance at the Securities Industry Association.
Analysts said they expect computer chip stocks, which had been firm ahead of the announcement on the expectation the ratio would rise modestly to somewhere between 0.99 and 1.03, to advance further following the upbeat data.
Shares of Intel Corp, the world's largest maker of semiconductors, surged as high as $124.69 in after-hours trade, 6 cents below its all-time trading high last week. Earlier, it closed up $1.625 at $123.875 on the Nasdaq market.
""I think it's an overall positive for stocks tomorrow,"" said Charles Boucher, semiconductor analyst at UBS Securities.
""The Street got possibly a little better than they were looking for, so I think you've got a chance to add on to this rally tomorrow,"" he said. ""The danger here is in investors getting too enthusiastic about the size of this number.""
Separately, the trade group said it was planning to phase out the North American semiconductor index and replace it with a global index that would help industry watchers keep better track of demand for computer chips.
The industry group said it was making the change because the current figure only tracks sales and orders in the Americas, representing only a third of the total world market, and provided disproportionate data on certain chip sectors.
While both industry and analysts have criticized the wide fluctuations and frequent revisions in the data -- even the September number was revised to 0.98 from 0.99 -- the move taken by industry consensus met with mixed reviews.
""I think it's a good idea,"" said Intel spokesman Howard High. ""The book-to-bill hasn't really reflected the true health of the industry, good or bad, for quite a while.""
""As the business turned very global in its nature, the book-to-bill flash report was a U.S.-based number,"" he said. ""If you take it to the global market, it's really not done the job that people have been using it for.""
But some analysts said the decision to drop aggregate bookings data altogether would only increase the amount of market uncertainty, as investors would have to rely on far more speculative estimates of new orders.
""I think it's going to blow up in their face,"" one top analyst said. ""It's going to be a lot more speculative. We're all going to be trying to do the analysis but we're going to be doing it based on our own independent surveys.""
Key semiconductor makers had argued, however, that bookings data was imprecise and subject to varying inventory strategies of distributors without any uniform reporting methods.",0
"Intel Corp. President Andrew Grove said the $400 billion personal computer industry must serve up more than just television-like features to impress its most demanding customers: 10-year-old kids.
In an opening speech at the Comdex trade show in which he hailed the 25th anniversary of the microprocessor which Intel invented, Grove demonstrated how PCs with his company's next-generation microchips will be able to deliver full-screen video with theater-like, surround-sound stereo.
But, he said, this would only bring the PC to parity with the television as an entertainment device.
The industry must focus on satisfying ""our most demanding users: 10-year-old kids,"" he said.
Using Intel chips and graphics technology from Salt Lake City-based Evans & Southerland Computer Co., Grove demonstrated how graphics could improve by the year 2000 to provide a more lifelike ""flythrough"" down a quiet English village street.
Demonstrating Intel's renewed emphasis on increasing consumer use of products based on its chips and technologies, Grove said the entire industry needs to focus on satisfying customers with aggressive output of new products.
""My fear is that some day that (product) cycle might sputter,"" he told reporters after his address. The industry should aim to grow by 15 percent to 17 percent a year, as it has for the last decade or more, he said.
""Just as we are investing in technology for the long term, we need to target the new users of the future today.""
This is particularly important as the cost of building a semiconductor plant has risen dramatically from $3 million in 1973 to $2.5 billion for its latest plant and will reach as much as $10 billion entering the next millennium.
Grove said the industry must be prepared to meet consumers' expectations, including those formed over a half century during which the television defined visual experience.
""We are in competition for these consumers, for their dollars and their leisure time,"" he said, arguing that time especially was a ""finite"" commodity and computers needed to compete with TV for consumer share.
Grove said there are only about one-third as many personal computers as TVs installed worldwide, even though the numbers of PCs sold annually is starting to outpace the number of new televisions sold on a worldwide basis.
""In this war, he who captures the most eyeballs wins,"" he said. ""In our battle for eyeballs, user experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing, it must exceed them.""
Grove projected that microprocessors could by the year 2011 be capable of holding 1 billion transistors and deliver 100,000 million instructions per second, or MIPS.
Grove said these advances are possible with current technology. Microprocessors are the semiconductors, invented by Intel engineers in 1971, which serve as the brains of personal computers.",0
"Archer Daniels Midland Co. Monday said it agreed to plead guilty to two counts of federal charges of price fixing in the sale of agricultural products and to pay record fines totaling $100 million.
Under the agreement, which is subject to court approval, ADM will pay $70 million to settle a charge of fixing prices for lysine, a feed additive for livestock, and $30 million in connection with citric acid, a food and beverage additive.
While the $100 million in fines were the largest ever in a criminal antitrust action, they will have only a minimal financial impact on the Decatur, Ill.-based agricultural products giant.
""This is not going to affect their balance sheet in any meaningful way,"" said NatWest Securities analyst David Nelson.
ADM has about $1.3 billion in cash and short-term securities on hand and another $1.1 billion in long-term securities it could sell if it needed to, analysts said.
But the settlement left unclear the fate of two top ADM executives who had been expected to face indictments in the government's four-year investigation of price-fixing for the food additives.
In a statement, ADM did not mention Vice Chairman Michael Andreas or Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining. The additives are derived from corn.
ADM had said in a proxy statement that indictments in the lysine probe were being considered against Wilson and Andreas, the son of ADM Chairman Dwayne Andreas.
""That's intriguing, that there is no mention (of) the individuals,"" said antitrust attorney Joe Sims, a partner in the Washington office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue who is not involved in the ADM antitrust case.
Sims called the wording of ADM's statement ""ambiguous.""
A government source said the Justice Department's antitrust investigation was ""ongoing."" Department officials declined to comment.
ADM did not return a phone call requesting comment on the status of possible indictments against the executives.
In its statement, ADM said the agreement brought an end to the government probe into ""alleged misconduct"" by the company, including its practices in the market for high-fructose corn syrup, a widely used sweetener that is one of ADM's most important products.
Analysts said the high-fructose corn syrup case could have been the biggest potential liabilty for ADM, given the size of that market. ADM previously settled civil cases brought by its customers and agreed to pay $25 million in the lysine case and $35 million to buyers of its citric acid.
A civil case brought by high-fructose corn syrup customers is pending.
""The important news here is just that the criminal investigation is behind them,"" said Bonnie Wittenburg, an analyst at Dain Bosworth, a Minneapolis-based brokerage.
Investors reacted positively to the settlement and sent ADM shares up 75 cents to $21.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, a 52-week high.
The federal probe of alleged price-fixing in the food and feed additive markets was first disclosed by ADM in June 1995. At that time, ADM said it was subpoenaed for documents and testimony as part of a probe of the lysine, citric acid and high-fructose corn syrup markets.
A former ADM executive, Mark Whitacre, acted as a government informant for about three years in the investigation. Whitacre, who was president of ADM's BioProducts Division, was fired in August 1995 when the company accused him of stealing $9.5 million.
Whitacre has denied those charges and has said he plans to file a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against ADM.
ADM said the plea agreement resulted from negotiations between Justice Department officials and a special committee of seven independent board members.
ADM said the special committee was created in 1995 to respond to the department's investigation into ADM's alleged anti-competitive activity and related civil litigation.
Analysts also said the fate of Michael Andreas was not expected to impact the succession at ADM. ""That issue was settled a long time ago. Mick is not a successor,"" said George Dahlman at Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based brokerage, referring to Michael Andreas.
In an interview in January, Dwayne Andreas said he believed there were eight people who might succeed him some day, including his son. But he said at the time there was no succession plan at the company. ADM's proxy statement lists Dwayne Andreas' age at 78.",0
"Despite losing out on two potential aircraft deals, McDonnell Douglas Corp's stock remains near its 52-week high, reflecting a strong balance sheet and expectations it will make an acquisition.
""The company is generating on the order of about $1.0 billion to $1.25 billion of free cash flow annually, which translates into between $5 and $7 a share,"" said BT Securities analyst Wolfgang Demisch, who has a buy rating on the stock.
That could enable the company to buy back shares or make a long-awaited defense acquisition, he added.  
Although it lost out on the race to build a next generation fighter for the Pentagon and rival Boeing Co was awarded a 103-plane AMR Corp deal, McDonnell Douglas shares remain relatively strong.  Shares were down $0.25 at $52.625 a share on Monday, $4.125 below a 52-week high of $56.75 but more than $10 above a low of $42.125.
In fact, losing out on the potential $2.2 billion in jet fighter contracts -- which could eventually be worth as much as $500 billion to the ultimate winner -- could prompt McDonnell Douglas to pursue an acquisition aggressively to build its defense business, analysts added.  
CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said he expected the company's ""board and management to take a fairly proactive stance...to do something in the merger and acquisition area.""
Analysts also shrugged off Boeing getting the plane order from AMR's American Airlines, saying McDonnell Douglas was not a serious contender after it cancelled development of its next generation commercial plane, known as the MD-XX.
""They were never in the running,"" Merrill Lynch analyst Byron Callan said of McDonnell Douglas.  
""The events don't affect near-term earnings in either case,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Howard Rubel said of the lost jet fighter and American Airlines deals.
McDonnell Douglas management said the Pentagon business would have been a significant long-term program for it.  But analysts said the company still has a chance to capture future military sales, particularly with acquisitions to build its portfolio, which now includes the F-18 fighter jet, C-17 military cargo plane and Apache helicopter.  
""The things to keep in mind are, the joint strike fighter is a long ways away.  It doesn't affect McDonnell Douglas' business portfolio near term,"" Callan said.
Callan added it is possible the new fighter jet might not be developed due to U.S. government budget pressures. And, in the interim, McDonnell Douglas could make its existing fighter jets more affordable and more capable.
Analysts dismissed the ideas that takeover speculation has been boosting McDonnell Douglas shares.  Earlier this year, McDonnell Douglas was reported to be in preliminary merger talks with Boeing, but a deal never materialized.  ""I don't think the people who own the stock today are looking at McDonnell Douglas as a takeover candidate,"" Callan said.",0
"Archer Daniels Midland Co, which pleaded guilty to price fixing this week, will face tough criticism at its annual meeting Thursday from shareholders seeking to make ADM's board more independent.
""There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at...both the board and the management level,"" said Edward Durkin, director of special programs at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.
The carpenters union is among four institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board.  
Despite the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, including the payment of $100 million in fines, corporate governance issues remain at ADM, according to Jon Lukomnik, New York City deputy controller for pensions.
""I think people are looking at this (the Justice settlement) as if it's the last scene in a five-act play. It is not,"" Lukomnik said.
Going forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.  
The chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.
""Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,"" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.
A shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.  
The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favor of that measure.
CalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.
""Our primary focus is the proposal,"" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS, said. ""But i think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).""
Other proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed confidential voting for directors when there is no competing proxy.
At last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, ""This meeting runs according to my rules.""
Durkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.
He added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. ""There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,"" Durkin said.",0
"Conseco Inc. said Monday it would buy Pioneer Financial Services Inc., a health and life insurer, for about $417 million in stock, extending its acquisition spree.
Carmel, Ind.-based Conseco will also pay $60 million to retire bank debt and pay other costs, the companies said.
For Conseco, the Pioneer acquisition -- its seventh deal announced this year alone -- is aimed at building its offerings for senior citizens.
Conseco is already among the leading providers of supplemental health insurance, retirement annuities and life insurance for consumers aged 40 and older, analysts said.
""The (aged) 65-plus consumer is a key part of the current marketplace and also a rapidly growing piece of that 40-plus marketplace,"" added James Rosensteele, Conseco spokesman.
The companies said the merger would create the largest distribution organisation selling health and life insurance products in the markets where it operates.
""It's an excellent match,"" Conseco Chairman Stephen Hilbert said in a statement.
Under the transaction, Conseco would use a fraction of a share of its common stock worth $25 to $28, depending on the price in the days before the closing, to buy Pioneer Financial stock. Pioneer debt notes would also become convertible into Conseco stock.
Pioneer Financial jumped $5.50 to $24.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Conseco stock was up 50 cents at $60 in consolidated trading.
The transaction is subject to approval by regulators and Pioneer Financial stockholders. It should be completed within 180 days, the companies said.
For Pioneer, a health and life insurance and annuities company based in Schaumburg, Ill., its agreement to join forces with Conseco reflects continued consolidation in the industry. Pioneer markets mainly to people 65 and older, small business owners and the self-employed.
""With the consolidation that's going on in the industry, you're going to have to be a mega-company to have the greatest efficiency and the greatest value to the customer,"" Everen analyst Frederick Sandburg said.
That consolidation is apparent in Conseco's track record of completing 16 acquisitions involving a total of 29 insurance companies since 1982.
Conseco is one of the nation's leading providers of supplemental health insurance, retirement annuities and universal life insurance.
Rosensteele said while acquisitions continued to be a part of Conseco's strategy, roughly half of the growth of its assets has been from new business generated by companies after they have been purchased.
Conseco said it would have $29 billion of assets and $32 billion of investments under management after completion of the Pioneer acquisition and other deals.
Beyond the portfolio of policies, the Pioneer acquisition also will add to Conseco's marketing efforts, particularly to senior citizens, analysts said. Pioneer has 90,000 agents, in addition to Conseco's 90,000 independent and career agents.
Founded in 1979, fast-growing Conseco has completed several acquisitions recently. In October, it completed the purchase of American Life Holdings Inc., a provider of annuities for retirement savings plans, for $165 million in cash.
On Aug. 26, Conseco agreed to acquire American Travellers Corp., a provider of long-term care insurance, for $793 million in stock, and Capitol American Financial Corp., which markets cancer insurance and other health coverage, for $650 million in cash and stock.
Also in August, Conseco completed the acquisition of Life Partners Group, a life insurer, for $600 million in stock, a deal that was announced on March 12.",0
"Monsanto Co said Monday its pending acquisition of Holden's Foundation Seeds, a $1.0 billion deal that gives it access to the worldwide seed corn market, will dilute earnings for two or three years.
In the first year, dilution could be as much as $0.10 to $0.17 a share, Filippello said, but cautioned the number could be lower than that due to pending accounting issues.
""But by the end of the decade, this will be accretive even from an accounting standpoint,"" Nicholas Filippello, chief economist for Monsanto, said in a telephone interview.  
Variables in determining the amount of earnings dilution include charges Monsanto may take in the future related to the Holden's deal. Those charges may include write-offs of Holden's in-process research and development, which would reduce the amount of ongoing amortization from the deal.
Based on Monsanto's benchmark of measuring itself on an ""economic value added"" (EVA) basis, the acquisition is positive for the company, Filippello added.
""We are willing to accept some near-term dilution in (earnings per share) from an accounting standpoint if in fact we are creating value in a net added value sense,"" he said.  
EVA is derived by taking net income and subtracting a charge for the capital used to generate that income, Monsanto said in its 1995 annual report.
Earlier, Monsanto said it will buy Holden's,  Corn States Hybrid Service Inc and  Corn States International for up to $1.02 billion.
Filippello said Monsanto will pay up to $945.0 million for Holden's, which produces corn germplasm used by seed companies to create hybrid seeds. It will pay up to $75 million for Corn States and Corn States International, which are the exclusive worldwide marketing and sales representatives for Holden's.  
Both prices may later be reduced, Filippello added.
Analysts said Monsanto's acquisition of Holden's, which had been expected, is also a defensive move to block its competitors from gaining access to the seed company.
NatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said he considers the planned acquisition of Holden's and Corn States ""a strategic positive"".
By buying Holden's, Monsanto gains an outlet for its genetic developments. Simply put, Monsanto can implant the genes it develops in the germplasm -- or parent seeds -- produced by Holden's.
Monsanto said more than 35 percent of the approximately 80 million acres of corn planted in the United Sates use genetic material developed by Holden's.
Filippello said the Corn States International acquisition also gives Monsanto access to some 300 million acres of corn worldwide.
The other positive for Monsanto is the ability to sell more of its flagship Roundup herbicide to farmers who plant genetically-enhanced seeds from Holden's. Monsanto has developed a gene that makes crops, like corn, resistant to use of its Roundup herbicide to kill weeds in the field.",0
"McDonald's Corp. on Friday reported a 10 percent rise in net income, despite a weak U.S. operating environment that was offset by growth overseas.
The fast-food giant, which has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide, said net income rose to $440 million from $400 million. Earnings per share gained 11 percent, with fewer shares outstanding, to 62 cents a share from 56 cents.
Earnings for the quarter, however, were about 1 cent below what analysts had expected.
McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said operating earnings in the United States fell five percent in the third quarter while company revenues rose only one percent.
""Our U.S. restaurants are operating in a complex, dynamic and difficult marketplace and recent operating performance has fallen short of our goals,"" Chairman Michael Quinlan said in a statement.
McDonald's said U.S. same store sales -- measuring results for units open at least one year -- were negative for both the third quarter and nine-month period.
But U.S. sales may be picking up, said Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes. ""I think (U.S. same store sales) are starting to hit bottom,"" Oakes said. ""Thus far in October, it (seems) like they have picked up and are in the flattish range.""
McDonald's recently reorganized its management to address disappointing results in the United States.
Outside the United States, McDonald's operating earnings grew 11 percent in the quarter as revenue jumped 13 percent.
It said growth in earnings was strongest in Hong Kong, England, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Taiwan. Results in Mexico remained weak due to the sluggish economy, it said.
While McDonald's continues to expand its global reach, the company said its new restaurant openings for 1996 and 1997 likely will be at the low-end of its targeted range of 2,500 to 3,200 units.
""We will hit the low end of our projected range (with) 2,500-plus restaurants (in 1996),"" McDonald's spokesman Chuck Ebeling said. ""We're just doing our planning for next year, but we expect to do 2,500 plus next year.""
This would be the first time in at least three years that McDonald's failed to meet its expansion projections, as it cuts back on limited menu, or satellite, units.
In 1995, McDonald's opened 2,430 units, beating the projection for that year of 2,300. In 1994, it opened 1,800 units, beating the projection of about 1,400 to 1,700.
McDonald's has nearly 20,000 restaurants worldwide.
""We've been ratcheting up the level of development every year since around 1991,"" Ebeling said.
Ebeling said McDonald's this year plans to open about ""600-plus"" satellite units worldwide, down from its original plan of 700 to 1,000 satellites. The biggest decline will be seen in the United States.
""We recognise we need higher volume restaurants to meet the kind of profitability that we'd like for ourselves and our franchisees,"" Ebeling said.
Merrill Lynch analyst Peter Oakes said the profitability of some satellite units, which are often built in non-traditional sites such as shopping malls, has been uncertain. ""In the big picture, the financial performance of satellites appears to be spotty,"" Oakes said.
Ebeling said U.S. satellite units will acount for about one-third of the total for these smaller sites, compared with 60 percent as originally planned.
Overall, Ebeling said about one-third of McDonald's total restaurant openings will still be in the United States.",0
"Kellogg Co. on Friday reported a drop of more than 30 percent in its third quarter profits as its cereal volume dropped in an intensely competitive market.
Kellogg, which makes Corn Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Fruit Loops and Special-K, is fighting back, launching marketing plans for the fourth quarter that are aimed at boosting its sales.
""We'll be taking what we believe are appropriate actions,"" Kellogg spokesman Richard Lovell said.
The company, the world's biggest maker of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, said its net income for the third quarter fell to $159.5 million, including a $21.3 million charge, from $230 million a year ago. On a per share basis, Kellogg's earnings dropped 29 percent to 75 cents, with fewer shares outstanding, from $1.05 last year.
Kellogg said its overall sales slipped 9 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.84 billion as continued weak prices for breakfast cereals offset a 1 percent gain in worldwide sales volume.
""As previously forecast, our third quarter performance was influenced significantly by competitive conditions in the U.S. cereal category,"" Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said in a statement.
Analysts estimate that Kellogg's domestic cereal sales volume fell 9 percent to 10 percent in the third quarter.
""We can't detail it. It was a challenging quarter in the U.S. and our volume was down,"" Lovell added.
Kellogg said its fourth quarter 1996 earnings likely will show a slight rise from the 77 cents it earned a year ago. First quarter 1997 earnings, however, may not match the 99 cents earned in the 1996 period.
""It's a challenging comparison,"" Lovell said.
Kellogg's stock fell on concern over U.S. cereal sales volume and the outlook for earnings, dropping $1 at $64.50 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, it set a new 52-week low of $64.125.
Kellogg said the U.S. cereal market overall was sluggish, with sales growing about 1.5 percent, measuring grocery stores, mass merchandisers and all other outlets.
Looking ahead, Kellogg refused to outline what promotional programmes it was planning for the fourth quarter.
Analysts said they did not expect the Battle Creek, Mich.-based cereal giant to return to deep-discount coupons or buy-one, get-one-free promotional giveaways.
""It's sort of left to speculation what they're going to do,"" SBC Warburg analyst Chris Jakubik said.
""There is no indication that, at this time, they have shifted from their long-term strategic goal, which is to reduce inefficient promotions,"" added BT Securities analyst John O'Neil.
Kellogg reduced prices on about two-thirds of its breakfast cereals in June. Other major manufacturers also cut prices this year as they battled for market share and tried to jump-start consumer purchases.
But those price cuts alone apparently were not enough to jump-start consumer purchases, according to Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz.
""The message there is that prices have to come down further,"" Rabinowitz said.
According to Information Resources data, U.S. ready-to-eat cereal sales in grocery stores fell 1.6 percent to 2.6 billion pounds for the 52 weeks ended Aug. 11, according to the most recent data available, compared with a year earlier.
Kellogg's sales volume declined in that period by 4.1 percent to 881.3 million pounds for a market share of about 34.4 percent, Information Resources said.",0
"McDonnell Douglas Corp. Friday announced the sudden resignation of the head of its aerospace business, Herbert Lanese, sparking speculation that disagreements over cost-cutting tactics might have hastened his departure.
Lanese, who joined the aircraft and aerospace firm in 1989 as senior vice president of finance, left the firm in an apparent disagreement with President Harry Stonecipher.
""Although Herb and I were in total agreeemtn regarding business objectives and strategy, we had sharp differences involving management and leadership styles,"" Stonecipher said in a statement. ""After two years of working together, it became obvious to me that these differences could not be reconciled.""
Merrill Lynch analyst Byron Callan called Lanese's departure ""a bolt out of the blue.""
""Herb had been tasked with reducing costs at McDonnell Douglas at the military aircraft business,"" Callan said. ""It may well have been (a dispute over) how do you go about doing that.""
Lanese, who became president of McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in March, 1996, after serving as deputy president since July 1995, had a difficult job from the start, analysts said. His focus on cost-cutting meant he had to tackle the thorny issue of reducing employment.
""When well over 50 percent of your costs are people, cost-cutting is a euphemism for cutting people,"" PaineWebber analyst John Modzelewski said. ""It's the hardest thing that you can do.""
Job security became the crux of labor troubles at McDonnell Douglas, with a strike by the International Association of Machinists that lasted from June 5 until Sept. 11 of this year.
Cost-cutting is ""where his (Lanese's) expertise lay with the company,"" said Mike Schoen, assistant director of business at District 837 of the Machinists union. ""And we weren't ready to be cut corners on.""
Slashing costs and raising capital, however, were hallmarks of Lanese's career when he was chief financial officer of McDonnell Douglas. Analysts credited him with a financial turnaround, which included raising cash and slashing debt, that led to record earnings.
""Singlehandedly, he was the person that I think was majorly responsible for the change in McDonnell Douglas,"" Modzelewski said.",0
"American Trans Air (ATA), which recently announced plans to cut back its jet capacity and some scheduled service, expects to forge additional alliances with other air carriers.
""We clearly think that code-sharing is an opportunity for this company to expand the markets in which it can participate,"" Kenneth Wolff, chief financial officer of Amtran Inc, parent of ATA, said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
In late May, ATA and Chicago Express Airlines agreed to a code-sharing agreement.  
Under these agreements, the airlines put their codes on each other's flights in computerized reservation systems.
""In general, it has exceeded our expectations, although this was a relationship which we both went into expecting some good things,"" Stanley Pace, president of the Indianapolis-based company, said of the alliance with Chicago Express. ""The benefits have been much more substantial than we both thought they would be.""
Looking ahead, ATA will continue to serve vacation destinations from Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Chicago's Midway Airport with charter and scheduled service.  
But Pace added that expansion of its service will be made more ""thoughtfully"" than in the past when the carrier underwent rapid growth.
In the second quarter, Amtran lost $0.20 a share, compared with a year-ago profit of $0.29, due to aggressive scheduled service expansion that was not as profitable as it had hoped.
ATA said last week it is cutting back some of its scheduled service, particularly from Boston to destinations like Orlando, Fla., and Nassau, Bahamas.
ATA also has said it is reducing lease obligations for Boeing Co 757 jets to boost its operating efficiency.  
These steps are expected to improve Amtran's profitability, although Pace said the next two quarters will be a transition period for the company.
Pace declined to comment on near-term earnings projections. According to First Call, the mean analyst estimate for the third quarter is $0.28, based on a wide range from breakeven to $0.55 a share. A year ago it earned $0.31.
""We're going to strengthen the bottom line fairly quickly over the next two quarters so that we have a solid foundation...to resume deliberate, systematic, thoughtful and profitable growth through 1997 and into 1998,"" Pace said.
Company executives acknowledged that some consumers postponed buying tickets on ATA following the May 11 ValuJet Inc crash in the Florida Everglades.
To allay consumer concerns, Pace said ATA emphasized its safety record of flying 23 years without any serious accidents.",0
"Monsanto Co. said Thursday it is considering several options for the future, including splitting into two separate, publicly traded corporations -- one a life sciences company and one a chemical business.
Other options being weighed by the St. Louis-based company are to sell or merge its chemical businesses with other firms or to keep the chemical operations and restructure them.
""In recent years, the strategies and needs of the chemical and life sciences businesses have become quite different,"" Chairman Robert Shapiro said in a statement.
Wall Street applauded the possible sale or spin-off of the chemical business, which had been expected, sending Monsanto's stock to a new 52-week high of $42.75 early in the day. The shares later traded at $42, up $1.375.
Analysts said Monsanto's life science businesses -- including agricultural chemicals, biotechnology, food additives and pharmaceuticals -- likely would have a higher valuation as a separate company than if Monsanto remained intact.
""The key here is that the chemical business does not have the growth potential as the ag-biotech and the ag-chemical and the drug component could,"" NatWest Securities analyst Mark Wiltamuth said.
Monsanto Chief Economist Nicholas Filippello said in a telephone interview that no options for the chemical operations had been ruled out.
He added that a decision was expected to be made as soon as possible, but did not give a timeframe. ""As soon as practical,"" he said.
Monsanto had been expected to shed its chemical businesses, which are affected by economic cycles and the price of commodity raw materials, since the sale late last year of its worldwide styrenics plastics business.
In recent months, it has been the strength of Monsanto's agricultural business that has propelled the stock upward.
Spinning off the chemical businesses as a separate company was the option that most analysts favoured, since it would not have the tax implication of an outright sale.
""I would say the chances of keeping it (chemicals) and restructuring it are pretty slim,"" Dain Bosworth analyst Bonnie Wittenburg said.
The chemical businesses that may be sold or spun off include nylon and acrylic fibers, Saflex plastic interlayer, which is sold to glass manufacturers, and speciality chemicals.
""The chemical operations ... would be very viable as a standalone company,"" said NatWest analyst Andrew Cash.
Cash said Monsanto's acrylic fiber, nylon and Saflex businesses have limited competition in the United States and very favourable cost structures.
""It would be a focused company with good technology ... and a lot of interest in the assets from a stock market perspective, if they choose to spin it off,"" Cash said.
However, agricultural chemicals would remain as one of the crown jewels of the life sciences division.
Monsanto's popular Roundup weed killer is key to Monsanto's agricultural biotechnology business. The company has developed crops that are genetically altered to resist Roundup.
The life science operations also would include food additives and Monsanto's G.D. Searle pharmaceutical division. In a recent report, NatWest said it expected Monsanto to keep Searle, which some analysts previously thought would be sold.
In 1995 Monsanto's chemical sales of $3.69 billion accounted for about 40 percent of the company's total sales of $8.96 billion. The chemical businesses' operating profit of $357 million was 30 percent of the total profit of $1.17 billion.
In contrast, agricultural profit of $523 million accounted for nearly 45 percent of the total.",0
"Quaker Oats Co. said Thursday its profits more than doubled in the latest quarter despite a drop in sales due to lower prices for breakfast cereals and heavy spending on its struggling Snapple beverage line.
Concerns over Snapple, which Quaker bought nearly two years ago for $1.7 billion, sent the company's stock down $1.75 to $34.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
""The stock is declining because they didn't announce any restructuring in Snapple, and some people had speculated they would,"" said William Leach, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette.
Overall, Quaker Oats reported net income for the third quarter of $133 million, or 98 cents a share, up from $61.5 million, or 45 cents per share, last year. The latest's quarter's results, however, included a $133.6 million pretax gain on the sale of its frozen foods business and $23 million in pretax restructuring charges.
Excluding these factors, Quaker's third quarter net income was 53 cents a share, which was well above Wall Street estimates of 46 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' estimates.
Chairman William William Smithburg said Snapple was expected to report an operating loss for 1996.
""Clearly, the biggest challenge facing the company is Snapple's disappointing performance,"" Smithburg said. ""The integrated sampling and advertising campaign that ended in mid-September generated some excitement behind the brand this summer, but we're still disappointed.""
While he declined to give a specific projection, he said the 1996 operating loss for Snapple likely will be narrower than the loss it reported in 1995, although the business will not generate a profit.
Excluding goodwill and other charges, Snapple's loss for 1995 was about $6 million, according to analysts' estimates.
Smithburg said Quaker executives believe Snapple can show a cash profit, which is the goal for next year. He added that results for Snapple could improve next year, even if sales volume were flat.
Quaker said several alternatives were being considered for Snapple. Those options include making Snapple into a regional brand or perhaps selling the beverage operations.
The company said its overall third-quarter sales slipped to $1.44 billion from last year's $1.55 billion, which included $72.3 million in sales from divested businesses.
Total beverage sales fell 11 percent to $593.4 million, while beverage operating income dropped 43 percent to $34.0 million. In the United States and Canada, beverage income was $57.5 million, excluding a $16.6 million restructuring charge, down 15 percent from last year.
Quaker said Gatorade sports drink, the company's single best-selling brand, had a 20 percent rise in operating profit in North America.
Despite an unseasonably cool summer, which hurt sales of the drink, Gatorade is having another good year, Smithburg said in a teleconference.
U.S. sales of Gatorade will hit about $1 billion by the end of October, compared with sales of just over $1 billion for all 1995. That is ""kind of an important milestone for us,"" Smithburg said.
Quaker said U.S. and Canadian foods' operating income of $92.6 million, excluding a $6.4 million restructuring charge, was up 7 percent from last year. These profits rose in spite of price decreases in ready-to-eat cereals.
Smithburg said Quaker's ready-to-eat cereals, such as Life and Cap'n Crunch, had a 14 percent rise in volume in the third quarter. Value-priced bagged cereals, which carry the Quaker name, are growing at more than 20 pecent.
The company said North American foods sales increased 2 percent to $687.3 million. International foods sales rose 9 percent to $152.9 million, with increases in Latin America, Europe and the Pacific. International foods operating income was $2.8 million, down from $3.7 million.",0
"Former Archer Daniels Midland Co executive Mark Whitacre, who acted as an informant in an antitrust case against the company, on Friday filed suit against ADM seeking back wages and punitive damages.
In a suit filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, Whitacre also formally denied charges previously brought by ADM that he allegedly stole $9.0 million from the agribusiness company.
""ADM's claim that Whitacre was fired for embezzlement is merely a pretext,"" the lawsuit says.  
""Whitacre was in fact fired for assisting the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) with its investigation into ADM,"" the suit continues.
Last month, ADM pleaded guilty to two counts of fixing prices of lysine, a feed additive and citric acid, which is used in food and beverages. It agreed to pay $100 million in fines, a record for U.S. antitrust cases.
In his suit, Whitacre seeks a judgment against ADM of more than $50,000 and punitive damages of more than $50,000. Potential damages, if awarded, could be much greater, perhaps in the tens of millions, sources close to the case said.  
In September, Whitacre had said he planned to file an $80 million wrongful discharge suit against ADM.
Legal experts said it is common practice in suits to seek damages above or below $50,000.
ADM did not respond to requests for comment on the suit.
In his suit, Whitacre is claiming lost wages from August, 1995, when he was fired as president of ADM's BioProducts Division, until October 1995 when he was hired as chief executive officere of  Biomar International Inc.
Whitacre earned $320,000 a year at ADM, plus stock options.  
In his suit, Whitacre charges ADM with denying him the right to exercise company stock options, defamation of his character and mental and emotional distress.
Whitacre has admitted to trying to kill himself last year after his role as an FBI mole became known.
He also claimed that he was forced to sell his home in the Decatur, Ill., area for only $400,000, even though it had been recently appraised for $1.0 million. Whitacre also said in the suit he had invested about $1.3 million on the home.
Whitacre is now a resident of Chapel Hill, N.C.
Whitacre's attorneys, Richard Kurth of Kurth & DeArmond of Danville, Ill., and Bill Walker of Granite City, Ill., were not immediately available for comment.
The lawsuit was not handled by Chicago attorney James Epstein of the firm Epstein, Zaideman & Esrig, who has been representing Whitacre. Asked if he has fired Epstein from the case, Whitacre replied, ""no comment.""
Epstein was not available for comment.",0
"By strengthening its management team with the new post of chairman of its domestic business, McDonald's Corp is attempting to address head-on its problems in the intensely competitive U.S. market.
""The signal they are trying to send is, 'we clearly recognize that we have problems in the U.S. and we are going to do something about it',"" NatWest Securities analyst Damon Brundage said.
Those problems include declining same store sales in the mature and intensely competitive U.S. market, analysts said.  
Analysts said they expect McDonald's third-quarter same store sales to be down compared with a year ago.
""They have not had a single positive month in the U.S. this year,"" Brundage said. McDonald's does not disclose same store data measuring sales from units open at least a year.
""Margins have been under pressure for over a year in the U.S.,"" added Schroder Wertheim analyst Wayne Daniels.
Naming Jack Greenberg, who remains vice chairman of the company, as chairman of McDonald's U.S.A. indicates the fast-food giant is not pleased with the direction of its domestic business, Daniels said.  
""They are trying to shake things up and put a little more focus on being aggressive in responding to the competition,"" Daniels added.
As part of the management changes, Edward Rensi, McDonald's U.S.A president, will report to Greenberg.
""Ed and I are good friends. We work well together. He's very enthusiastic about this,"" Greenberg said in a telephone interview. ""We all want this business to do well.""
Despite the pressure in the United States, McDonald's international business, which accounts for more than half of its operating income, continues to be strong, analysts said.  
""International is a wide-open growth opportunity for McDonald's,"" Daniels said.
Given the intense competition between McDonald's, Wendy's International Inc and Grand Metropolitan plc's Burger King, Greenberg faces a tough job as head of the U.S. operations, analysts said.
""He is going to parachute into...what looks to be one of the most challenging operating roles in the U.S. fast-food restaurant business,"" Brundage said.
But Greenberg, 54, said he believes McDonald's is well positioned to compete in the U.S. market. ""We've got more locations than anybody else. We've got the most powerful brand in the world...We've got the largest marketing budget. We've got enormous purchasing power,"" he added.
McDonald's operates more than 19,200 restaurants worldwide, including about 12,000 in the United States.
While Greenberg joined McDonald's in 1982 as chief financial officer, he said he has field experience with its restaurants. ""I spent a year in the field in restaurants and became a regional manager for a year as well,"" Greenberg said.",0
"Archer Daniels Midland Co.'s Chairman Dwayne Andreas apologised to shareholders Thursday for the ""difficult situations"" that the company faced over the past year.
Andreas, like other ADM officials who spoke at the meeting, used mostly euphemisms when referring to ADM's guilty pleas to two counts of pricing-fixing and an agreement to pay $100 million in fines to the U.S. government.
""I acknowledge to you that this occurred on my watch as chairman of your company,"" Andreas told shareholders at the annual meeting here. ""You have my apology and my commitment that things are arranged so that this will never happen again.""
A proposal requiring the board be composed of a majority of independent directors was defeated, but received 42 percent of the votes cast.
Other shareholder proposals addressing corporate governance issues did not pass. ADM's slate of 12 directors was approved by about 89 percent of the votes cast, the company announced.
The new board, which was reduced in number from 17, was hailed by ADM as a more independent body since Andreas is the only company executive remaining on the board.
William Bell of the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund said he hoped the 42 percent of the votes cast in favour of the outside director measure would send a signal to ADM about shareholder concerns regarding the independence of the board.
""I think it's a positive number,"" Bell told reporters after the meeting. The Florida trust fund and the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers) co-sponsored the independent board proposal.
In a statement released following the meeting, Charles Valdes, chairman of the Calpers, said ""Calpers will continue to meet with directors and pursue the wishes of shareholders that want a majority of indpependent directors and increased oversight of the ADM board.""
During the meeting, no mention was made of a pending U.S. Department of Justice investigation of Michael Andreas, vice chairman and son of Dwayne Andreas, and Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining.
These two executives are eligible for stock options under an incentive plan that was approved by stockholders Thursday, the company said in response to a question.
The antitrust investigation sparked criticism from some large shareholders who questioned the independence of ADM's board of directors and its ability to oversee management.
One of the few direct mentions of the antitrust investigation came in response to a question from Ed Durkin of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, an institutional shareholder.
Durkin asked why ADM had not notified shareholders officially of its guilty pleas to two counts of price fixing and the $100 million plea. Richard Reising, corporate secretary and general counsel, said the company did not consider it necessary given the amount of publicity the antitrust settlement received.
ADM board member Brian Mulroney, former Prime Minister of Canada, told shareholders the ""consensual resolution"" with the Justice Department was reached after negotiations with the board's special committee of independent directors.
""This has been a terribly unfortunate experience for the company and we as a committee deeply deplore it,"" Mulroney said.
""It is our intention to ensure that the company learns from mistakes in the past and acts so that they never happen again,"" Mulroney said.
He referred to the investigation of ADM as a ""shadow"" that was cast on the future of the company.
""While some matters still await resolution, I am pleased to tell you today that we have begun to cast off that shadow and move the company forward into the future...,"" Mulroney said.",0
"Oneok Inc. and Western Resources Inc. on Thursday agreed to a $660 million deal that combines their natural gas assets and gives Western Resources access to a broader base of customers for its electricity and security services.
The deal reflects the moves within the utility industry to prepare for further deregulation.
Under the agreement, Oneok will take all the natural gas assets of Western Resources, making it the ninth largest gas distribution company in the United States serving 1.4 million customers. Tulsa-based Oneok is the parent of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co.
Western Resources, based in Topeka, Kan., will become the largest equity holder in Oneok, receiving about 3 million new shares of Oneok common stock and preferred stock that will be convertible, upon necessary regulatory approvals, into about another 19.3 million shares of Oneok common. Its total stake in Oneok is about 45 percent.
The deal is expected to close by mid-1997, following approval by Oneok shareholders and federal and state regulatory authorities.
""They (Oneok) are a total gas company. They understand the gas business better than we do,"" Western Resources president David Wittig said in a telephone interview.
By swapping its gas assets, Western Resources will be able to focus its efforts on growing its electricity and home-security businesses, both of which involve a customer base of home owners and 24-hour monitoring of consumers.
Oneok's 735,000 customers could become potential clients of Western Resources' services.
""Western Rseources has been becoming a nationwide marketer of retail energy -- electricity and/or gas -- and home security,"" Everen Securities analyst Dan Rudakas said. ""This combination gives them direct access to another 735,000 gas customers, which in the future ... would be potential electric customers and also electronic home security customers.""
The companies said the alliance will position the companies to take advantage of the expected deregulation of the electricity industry, allowing customers to buy electrical power from several sources instead of just the local utility. That type of deregulation is already taking place in the natural gas industry.
""Eventuallly there will be total competition in electricity and in gas,"" John Hayes Jr, Western Resources chairman, told a teleconference. ""We are just preparing for the future.""
The companies said Oneok's independence would be preserved by standstill provisions in the agreement that define the rights and responsibilities of the respective companies for at least the next 15 years.
Western Resources will receive a preferred dividend of 1.5 times the underlying common dividend, which now stands at 30 cents a share, but no less than $1.80 per preferred share per year for the first five years.
George K. Baum analyst Dennis Hudson said Western Resources' natural gas assets earned that company about $20 million in 1995. As part of Oneok, the assets likely will earn more, given that company's expertise in gas distributions and synergies from its existing gas business.
With its stake in Oneok, Western Resources will still benefit from a portion of the gas earnings, as well as future gas alliances that Oneok might enter into in the future.
""Oneok would continue to search for opportunities to acquire more customers on the gas side. We're most supportive of that,"" Wittig said.
He added that Western Resources continues to look for ways to expand its electricity and home-security businesses.",0
"Archer Daniels Midland Co., which pleaded guilty to price fixing this week, will face tough criticism at its October 17 annual meeting from shareholders seeking to make ADM's board more independent.
""There needs to be dramatic reform at this company, at...both the board and the management level,"" said Edward Durkin, director of special programmes at the United Brotherhood of Carpenters.
The carpenters union is among four institutional shareholders pressing for changes in ADM's board.
Despite the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, including the payment of $100 million in fines, corporate governance issues remain at ADM, according to Jon Lukomnik, New York City deputy controller for pensions.
""I think people are looking at this (the Justice settlement) as if it's the last scene in a five-act play. It is not,"" Lukomnik said.
Going forward, Lukomnik said he is looking for ADM to, over time, enact steps to make its board more independent and to set a succession plan for the eventual retirement of Chairman Dwayne Andreas, aged 78.
The chairman's son, Vice Chairman Michael Andreas, is among two executives still being investigated by the Justice Department as the price-fixing probe continues. Also being investigated is ADM Group Vice President Terrance Wilson.
""Dwayne Andreas is not young. A person they were grooming to be a successor is the target of an investigation,"" Lukomnik said, referring to Michael Andreas, who had been seen in the past as a possible successor to the chairman's post.
As previously reported, a shareholder proposal calling for a more independent board at ADM is garnering a significant number of votes.
The California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) said earlier a survey of votes cast thus far indicated that 47 percent are in favour of that measure.
CalPERS co-sponsored the proposal with the Florida Retirement System Trust Fund.
""Our primary focus is the proposal,"" Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS said. ""But i think we also need to see some increased oversight (of management by the board).""
Other proposals include a measure by the carpenters to hold directors personally liable for gross negligence. The New York City Fire Department Pension Fund proposed that shareholders' votes for directors remain confidential when there is no competing proxy.
At last year's annual meeting, Chairman Dwayne Andreas kept a lid on shareholder comments. When Durkin of the carpenters union tried to gain the floor, he was told by the chairman, ""This meeting runs according to my rules.""
Durkin, who will attend this year's annual meeting, said he was hopeful shareholders would be able to voice their concerns this year.
He added the company had sent him a fax outlining the agenda, when issues will be raised and how much time will be allotted for comments. ""There needs to be some basic rights allowed to the (share) owners,"" Durkin said.
The Justice Department said its price-fixing investigation continues. ADM has agreed to cooperate with probes involving citric acid as well as high fructose corn syrup.
Hoffman-La Roche Inc, the Nutley, N.J. unit of Roche Holding Ltd of Switzerland, said it has been cooperating with the Justice investigation of citric acid, which is used in food, beverages and other products.
A.E. Staley, a unit of Tate and Lyle Plc of the United Kingdom, said it is not a target in the high fructose corn syrup probe and is cooperating with that investigation.",0
"Deere & Co. Tuesday reported record fourth-quarter and annual earnings as demand grew for its agricultural, industrial, commercial and consumer equipment worldwide.
Net income jumped 15 percent to $173.9 million, or 68 cents a share, for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $150.6 million, or 57 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenues rose 7 percent to $2.9 billion from $2.7 billion.
""The company's operating margins remain strong as our focus on continuous improvement and growth is having a positive impact throughout our businesses,"" Deere Chairman Hans Becherer said in a statement.
But fourth quarter profits were less than some analysts had expected, although results did include a $15 million after-tax write-off to integrate and consolidate various Mexican operations.
Deere's stock dropped $2.625 to $44 on the New York Stock Exchange.
""Deere came in a little light on a reported basis,"" NatWest Markets analyst Thomas Burns said.
Profits for the fiscal year rose 16 percent to $817.3 million, or $3.14 a share, from $706.1 million, or $2.71 a share, last year. Revenues climbed 9 percent to $11.2 billion from $10.3 billion.
One area of weakness was Deere's commercial and consumer equipment business, such as lawn and landscaping products.
Worldwide commercial and consumer equipment operating profits fell to $1 million for the fourth quarter from $35 million last year, and to $118 million for the full fiscal year from $165 million a year ago. Deere blamed the drop on lower sales volume and increased promotional and growth expenditures.
""The one big operational shortfall that was very, very disappointing and was a surprise to us was the commercial and consumer business,"" Dain Bosworth analyst J. Blair Brumley said.
Moline, Ill.-based Deere said export sales from the United States continued to grow, by 20 percent to $1.58 billion for 1996 from $1.31 billion last year.
Overseas sales for the year remained very strong, rising by 26 percent to $2.75 billion, topping $2.5 billion for the first time in the company's history, Deere said.
Worldwide agricultural equipment operating profits jumped to $202 million for the fourth quarter from $135 million in the year-ago period.
Worldwide demand for John Deere agricultural equipment remains very strong, Becherer said.
Overseas agricultural equipment sales, which were strong during 1996, are expected to continue to increase in 1997 due to sales in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Industrial equipment operating profit fell to $34 million for the fourth quarter from $36 million last year. Deere cited increased development expenses associated with improving the fuel efficiency and emissions performance of new engines.
Net income of Deere's financial services subsidiaries was $47.6 million for the quarter vs. $41 million a year ago.
Looking ahead, Deere said it expected worldwide physical volume of sales to dealers on a comparable basis to increase by about 5 percent in 1997 compared with 1996.",0
"Quaker Oats Co. is looking to shed its Snapple beverage business and, in the process, may also end up selling the Gatorade sports drink line, its single largest brand, analysts said Friday.
""I think it's up for sale,"" Prudential Securities analyst John McMillin said of Quaker's beverage division.
Speculation that Quaker may get rid of Snapple, which has posted operating losses since it was purchased for $1.8 billion two years ago, boosted Quaker's stock, which gained $1.50 to $37.50 in early afternoon trading on on the New York Stock Exchange.
""We've been saying since this summer that there was a high probability that Quaker would pursue a restructuring, and beyond just Snapple,"" CS First Boston analyst Michael Mauboussin said.
He said that a possible restructuring at Quaker likely would include selling some assets, which Mauboussin said were currently under-valued.
""Gatorade being the crown jewel, clearly,"" he added.
Rumors regarding an outright purchase of Quaker or various parts of its businesses have swirled around the Chicago-based company for about three years. Quaker has consistently declined to comment on any speculation.
""I will simply tell you that it is our policy not to comment on rumors and speculation,"" Quaker spokesman Ronald Bottrell said Friday.
The speculation gained credibility, analysts said, when the Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Quaker might sell Gatorade and Snapple, with prices quoted between $3 billion and $4 billion.
""I would have said (the chance of Quaker selling its beverage business was) less than 50-50 before I read the article,"" BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said. ""But I think if somebody offers them $4 billion ... they have to take it.""
The Wall Street Journal said the most likely buyers for Quaker's beverage business were said to be Procter & Gamble Co. and PepsiCo Inc..
PepsiCo also declined to comment.
""We have a long standing policy of not commenting on rumors,"" said Richard Detwiler, director of public relations for PepsiCo.
If Quaker sold its beverage businesses, its food businesses, including oatmeal, ready-to-eat cereal and pasta and rice dishes, could also attract buyers, analysts said.
The Wall Street Journal said Philip Morris Cos. Inc. might be interested in buying some of Quaker's food brands to bolster its Kraft Foods operation.
A Kraft spokesman did not return a call seeking comment.
It had been widely anticipated that Quaker would scale back Snapple to a regional brand, spin it off or sell it.
Quaker management, however, said earlier this year that Snapple's fruit-flavored and iced tea beverage business would remain a national brand.
""What he (Chairman William Smithburg) has been saying does not indicate that he is looking to sell the business right now,"" O'Neil of BT Securities said. ""But he always comments that he will act to increase shareholder value.""
Smith Barney analyst David Rabinowitz said selling off Quaker's businesses may yield the highest return to shareholders on a short-term basis. But ""it doesn't have to happen,"" Rabinowitz said.
Analysts have said previously that they expected Quaker to write off additional goodwill for Snapple, which would be a non-cash charge.
The company said in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it will review Snapple for a possible charge to reduce its carrying value.",0
"Archer Daniels Midland Co. Monday said it agreed to plead guilty to two counts of federal charges of price fixing in the sale of agricultural products and to pay record fines totalling $100 million.
Under the agreement, which is subject to court approval, ADM will pay $70 million to settle a charge of fixing prices for lysine, a feed additive for livestock, and $30 million in connection with citric acid, a food and beverage additive.
While the $100 million in fines were the largest ever in a criminal antitrust action, they will have only a minimal financial impact on the Decatur, Ill.-based agricultural products giant.
""This is not going to affect their balance sheet in any meaningful way,"" said NatWest Securities analyst David Nelson.
ADM has about $1.3 billion in cash and short-term securities on hand and another $1.1 billion in long-term securities it could sell if it needed to, analysts said.
But the settlement left unclear the fate of two top ADM executives who had been expected to face indictments in the government's four-year investigation of price-fixing for the food additives.
In a statement, ADM did not mention Vice Chairman Michael Andreas or Terrance Wilson, a group vice president in charge of corn refining. The additives are derived from corn.
ADM had said in a proxy statement that indictments in the lysine probe were being considered against Wilson and Andreas, the son of ADM Chairman Dwayne Andreas.
""That's intriguing, that there is no mention (of) the individuals,"" said antitrust attorney Joe Sims, a partner in the Washington office of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue who is not involved in the ADM antitrust case.
Sims called the wording of ADM's statement ""ambiguous.""
A government source said the Justice Department's antitrust investigation was ""ongoing."" Department officials declined to comment.
ADM did not return a phone call requesting comment on the status of possible indictments against the executives.
In its statement, ADM said the agreement brought an end to the government probe into ""alleged misconduct"" by the company, including its practices in the market for high-fructose corn syrup, a widely used sweetener that is one of ADM's most important products.
Analysts said the high-fructose corn syrup case could have been the biggest potential liabilty for ADM, given the size of that market. ADM previously settled civil cases brought by its customers and agreed to pay $25 million in the lysine case and $35 million to buyers of its citric acid.
A civil case brought by high-fructose corn syrup customers is pending.
""The important news here is just that the criminal investigation is behind them,"" said Bonnie Wittenburg, an analyst at Dain Bosworth, a Minneapolis-based brokerage.
Investors reacted positively to the settlement and sent ADM shares up 75 cents to $21.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, a 52-week high.
The federal probe of alleged price-fixing in the food and feed additive markets was first disclosed by ADM in June 1995. At that time, ADM said it was subpoenaed for documents and testimony as part of a probe of the lysine, citric acid and high-fructose corn syrup markets.
A former ADM executive, Mark Whitacre, acted as a government informant for about three years in the investigation. Whitacre, who was president of ADM's BioProducts Division, was fired in August 1995 when the company accused him of stealing $9.5 million.
Whitacre has denied those charges and has said he plans to file a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against ADM.
ADM said the plea agreement resulted from negotiations between Justice Department officials and a special committee of seven independent board members.
ADM said the special committee was created in 1995 to respond to the department's investigation into ADM's alleged anti-competitive activity and related civil litigation.
Analysts also said the fate of Michael Andreas was not expected to impact the succession at ADM. ""That issue was settled a long time ago. Mick is not a successor,"" said George Dahlman at Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis-based brokerage, referring to Michael Andreas.
In an interview in January, Dwayne Andreas said he believed there were eight people who might succeed him some day, including his son. But he said at the time there was no succession plan at the company. ADM's proxy statement lists Dwayne Andreas' age at 78.",0
"The burger battle will continue in the United States next year as fast-food chains test new recipes and cook up promotions to draw more customers into their eateries -- and away from each other.
McDonald's Corp dominates the landscape with about 12,000 U.S. units and over 20,000 worldwide. But in spite of a new menu, its U.S. same-store sales are below year-ago levels.
""This will be their sixth consecutive quarter of lower comps (same store sales) in the U.S.,"" Dean Witter analyst David Adelman said, referring to the fourth quarter of 1996.
Wendy's International Inc, on the other hand, has seen U.S. same store sales rise five to six percent in the fourth quarter, following an eight percent gain in the third quarter. Spokesman Denny Lynch declined to comment.
""Wendy's..., although their margins have been squeezed, has the best traffic of the big three,"" said Roger Lipton of Lipton Financial Services.
Wendy's has about 4,425 U.S. units and 4,925 worldwide.
Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan Plc, said its U.S. same-store sales rose 2.6 percent for fiscal 1996 ended September 30.
Burger King had 8,696 units worldwide at the end of fiscal 1996, including more than 6,600 in the United States.
At this point, Wendy's may have the most significant new product offering in 1997, a fresh pita sandwich that is currently being tested in 11 U.S. markets and may be rolled out nationally next year, analysts said.
""It's being given very serious consideration,"" Lynch said of pita sandwiches. ""We're very pleased with the test.""
Adelman said he expects the pita sandwich to be launched in the United States later in 1997, adding, ""That's going to be a material event for (Wendy's).""
In 1996, McDonald's stole the menu spotlight by introducing its Arch Deluxe hamburger, garnished with lettuce, tomato and a mustard-mayonnaise sauce, as well new chicken and fish deluxe sandwiches.
In spite of those new menu items, McDonald's same store sales continued to show declines compared with a year ago.
McDonald's U.S. same store sales showed a negative comparison in the first nine months of 1996, spokesman Chuck Ebeling said, but he declined comment on the fourth quarter.
McDonald's has blamed the drop in its U.S. same store sales in part on an intensely competitive domestic market.
Looking ahead, analysts said the most significant event for McDonald's likely will be the start in 1997 of its 10-year exclusive marketing alliance with Walt Disney Co. That alliance gives McDonald's exclusive rights to marketing tie-ins -- such as toy giveaways -- to Disney movies.
Ebeling said the Disney alliance will be the ""centerpiece"" of McDonald's marketing efforts, ""but not the only thing.""
As for its menu, Ebeling said McDonald's will continue to focus on ""delivering great food taste,"" but he did not comment on new items.",0
"Germany and the Czech republic announced on Monday that a long-awaited declaration on post- World War Two reconciliation would be initialled this week but politicians on both sides withheld final approval of the text.
The two foreign ministries said Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Germany's Klaus Kinkel would sign the document in Prague on Friday, at a ceremony ending two years of talks.
The declaration, expressing regret at both Nazi atrocities during the war and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from former Czechoslovakia afterwards, then has to be signed by the two countries' presidents and confirmed by the two parliaments.
But Germany's Christian Social Union (CSU), political sponsor of the expelled Germans, said its support for the text was not guaranteed.
""I would speak of a conditional 'yes',"" Finance Minister and CSU chairman Theo Waigel told reporters. He said last-minute changes to the text could not be ruled out.
Final approval from the CSU, a partner in the Bonn coalition, would depend on assurances that the Sudeten Germans, as they are known, would be ""involved at an appropriate level"" in a dialogue between Prague and Bonn, he said.
The Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudeten Germans were given better terms.
In the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.
Members of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, said on Sunday that they still had concerns about vaguely-worded compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.
""(The party) has done all it can for the declaration to be accepted, but it still expects a bit more work (on the text),"" a Social Democrat senator from the once German-annexed district of Upper Moravia, Petr Moravek, told Czech Television.
Stanislav Gross, the head of the Social Democrat caucus in the house, was quoted in the daily Pravo on Monday as saying he would not vote for the declaration in its present form.
The Czech foreign ministry said in a statement that Zieleniec and Kinkel would ""sign a protocol on the completion of negotiations of the Czech-German Declaration of mutual relations and their future development"".
The full declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of the Sudeten Germans.
The text angered groups representing families of the Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate those who had lost property during the expulsions.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.
The text says the fund is to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific projects, youth meetings, and partnership projects.
But the text adds that: ""The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National-Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.""
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
In early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.",0
"Volkswagen AG Czech unit, Skoda Auto a.s., on Friday launched sales of its new sedan, the Octavia, hoping to kill off jokes about Communist-era quality, and pull the company into profit.
Officials said the new model, built on a common VW platform designed for the 1998 Audi A3 and upgraded Golf, would expand Skoda's market penetration by putting the company's first post-Communist mid-sized car in showrooms worldwide.
""Our strategic markets are in central and eastern Europe, western Europe, and we are present in some Asian markets. We expect to sell Octavias successfully in all of our 66 markets,"" marketing director Frank Farsky told Reuters.
The new sedan received a heroe's welcome at showrooms around the capital Prague on Friday as crowds gathered to watch dealers mount the Octavia on viewing pedastals.
Exports of the front-grilled Octavia -- a major step away from the boxy sub-compacts which made the Communist-era Skoda the butt of automotive jokes worldwide --  to Europe and beyond later this year or in the first quarter next year.
The car will be available on the domestic market with a choice of three petrol and two diesel engines, with the top-of-the-line SLX automatic model priced at 497,900 crowns, and a base model priced at 335,700 crowns.
""In the Czech market its more or less toward a luxury- class car by the nature the purchasing power and the nature of the car market itself,"" Farsky said.
""In western europe it is a medium sized car that will belong to the middle class market, and in asian marekts I thinik it will be toward the luxury class,"" he added.
Skoda will make 64,000 Octavias in 1997 at its new purpose-built plant in Mlada Boleslav north of Prague, and raise production to 90,000 in 1998.
Skoda Chairman Ludvik Kalma said earlier this year he expected 20,000 Octavias to be sold annually on the home market, with the rest exported to Europe and points East.
""I think customers who would be looking for a used car would look at a Skoda Octavia, I think that people who own a smaller car would look at Octavia,"" Farsky said.
The company lost 1.621 billion crowns last year due to heavy investments into the new factory, but Kalma said the firm should come close to breaking even this year.",0
"Germany and the Czech Republic on Friday concluded nearly two years of sensitive talks on a joint declaration aimed at finally healing the wounds of World War Two and the communist era that followed.
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and his Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec signed a protocol which sends forward a text expressing regret for injustices on both sides, and setting up a fund for joint projects.
The declaration expresses Bonn's sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and Prague's regret for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans.
It marks Germany's final reconciliation with neighbours who fell under Nazi occupation.
""We Germans regret the suffering and injustice caused to the Czech people by National-Socialist (Nazi) crimes, and we are recognising our responsibility,"" Kinkel told diplomats and journalists after signing the protocol.
The text was approved by both governments earlier this week, and is to be signed by prime ministers in January, but politicians on both sides of the border are calling for changes before parliaments and presidents give it their final approval.
Both Kinkel and Zielenec insisted the text would not be reopened for negotiation.
Czech opponents of the text claim it fails to pay direct compensation to victims of Nazi agression, while German groups are furious that it avoids paying restitution for Prague's expropriation of property of the so-called Sudeten Germans.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.
The text says the fund is to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific ones, adding that ""the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of victims of (Nazi) violence.""
""The declaration which we have agreed on means simply a clarification of understanding,"" Zieleniec said.
""This declaration is not a full stop after history. It only closes one sentence and one paragraph. It also is a semi-colon and starts a discussion on the topic of joint projects focused on the future,"" he added.
The main political critic in Germany is the Bavarian-based Christian Social Union (CSU) which acts as mentor to the Sudeten Germans, survivors and relatives of the 2.5 million ethnic Germans who were collectively blamed for the Nazi occupation and summarily driven out.
Leaders of Bavaria, where most Sudetens settled, had demanded changes in the text, but the Czech government has insisted it will negotiate only with Bonn.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is due to sign the declaration with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus in January and the presidents of the two countries will then address each other's parliaments to seal the matter.
A major German daily newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, on Friday called the declaration a political sham.
""Perhaps one day there will be a German-Czech declaration which in its honesty and sincerity does provide a historic sign of reconciliation,"" the daily said in a commentary.",0
"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky said that despite objections from some cabinet officials, it was too early to write off the central bank's plan to create post-Communist Europe's largest bank.
Tosovsky said he expected the full cabinet to consider ""in a few weeks"" the CNB's plan which includes the proposed merger of the savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s. with the foreign trade bank  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB).
""There are only some preliminary opinions of some official who saw our proposal. Because most of the members of the cabinet didn't see our proposal, so it's too early,"" he told Reuters Financial TV in an interview to be broadcast later.
""I don't know what will be the decision of the government.""
The central bank has submitted a broad plan seeking to fully privatise state holdings in the ""Big Four"" largest banks, but Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said last week the cabinet needed more concrete details.
The most controversial plan calls for Sporitelna and CSOB to merge to create a bank with over $20 billion in assets and then to privatise the state's stake in the newly-created bank several years later after the merger is analysed.
Klaus has reacted coolly to the merger plan, saying it was akin to fusing Prague's top two soccer teams Sparta and Slavia, something unthinkable for many Czechs.
The plan has also been criticised by a key Klaus adviser, Martin Kocourek, and by officials at both institutions who said they want to preserve the specific character of each bank.
But the central bank's plan, which Tosovsky said is from the point of view of a regulator to promote stability of the entire banking system, seeks to create a bank which would compete better against large western European institutions.
""We feel that it would be possible to find some closer ties between CSOB and (Sporitelna), and we see a merger could be made,"" Tosovsky said, but added that ""it would require more professional analysis.""
Tosovsky said that if the merger plan was not adopted then a strategic foreign partner ""would be welcome in CSOB -- this means the fast privatisation with a foreign strategic partner, but this is only if the idea about the merger is not accepted.""
A variety of Czech and Slovak state institutions, including the central banks, hold CSOB shares. Ceska Sporitelna has had some stakes privatised through the voucher-privatisation programme, but the state still holds a 45 percent stake.
The CNB and the Finance Ministry have both called for the fast privatisation of the state's roughly one-third stake in Investicni a Postovni Banka to a strategic foreign partner. Japan's Nomura and Dutch ING NV are widely seen as frontrunners seeking IPB shares.
Tosovsky said the roughly 49 percent stake in the largest commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s. should be divided into smaller units and sold to a variety of investors, not a single foreign strategic partner.
""As concerns Komercni Banka, there is no rush as concerns the privatisation but no reason to delay as well,"" he said.
""(Komercni), in our opinion, doesn't need a foreign strategic partner, and there could be small stakes and more investors could be invited to enter into the this bank.""",0
"As Czech leaders finally get around to discuss a worrying surge in the trade deficit, analysts suggest a mixed bag of macro and micro-economic fixes, but most say devaluing the crown should be avoided.
Some say the deficit is a necessary product of economic reform and will turn around next year, while the gap between growth in imports, up a nominal 15.2 percent in January-August year-on-year, and exports, up 6.4 percent, will close.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, who for months said there was nothing to worry about as the deficit soared, finally bowed to pressure and called a meeting for Tuesday to confront the gap.
But the meeting was abruptly postponed on Monday with cabinet officials citing the rising pressure of October's parliament session as a reason. A new date for the meeting has yet to be set, but officials say it will be ""soon"".
The trade deficit grew to a record 100 billion crowns ($3.68 billion) from January-August, the same as for the whole of 1995, and the markets are anxiously awaiting to see what, if anything, might be done.
Forecasts say that the current account deficit will also grow to around six percent of gross domestic product in 1996 from four percent last year.
When Klaus and three cabinet members, plus central bank Governor Josef Tosovsky and Czech Statistical Bureau chairman Edvard Outrata, finally discuss possible fixes for the rapidly expanding gap, they will have heard plenty of advice.
Many analysts say capital inflows can finance the deficit in the short term and urge moves, other than devaluation, that would gradually improve the competitiveness of Czech exporters.
Others suggest measures that could bring immediate relief, including import charges and fiscal adjustment.
GOVERNMENT SHOULD AIM FOR BUDGET SURPLUS NEXT YEAR
""The reaction should come immediately, before the deficit becomes unmanageable,"" said Vladimir Kreidl, economist at Prague's Patria Finance.
Klaus's government should not only pass its fifth straight balanced budget, but fight for a 1997 surplus of one or two percent of GDP. Other fiscal restrictions could be imposed to help cut domestic demand for imports, he said.
""Fiscal restriction is the most effective tool for reducing the deficit,"" Kreidl said, adding that the government should back private savings and a fully-funded pension system.
STRUCTURAL REFORMS NEEDED TO BOOST COMPETITIVENESS
Kreidl said more attention was needed to improve the capital markets which would strengthen currency inflow. Speeding up privatisation by sell-offs to strategic foreign investors would also boost competitiveness, he said.
""Czech exporters must become more cost competitive,"" said Jiri Huebner, Czech and Slovak team director for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
""There is a need for substantial investments in new plant and technology...to improve productivity.""
The government has contended that many of the imports which are fuelling the deficit are modernising Czech industry, which should eventually produce higher export output, but Huebner said more targeted policies were necessary.
He advocated an acceleration of depreciation on new capital expenditures and relaxing tax write-offs of bad debts to spark The government must separate investment funds from bank management to ensure shareholders' interests are a priority, not the credit activity of the parent bank, he said. ""The government should prohibit bankers from the credits side of the business (from sitting) on company boards,"" he said.
IMPORT CURBS MAY HELP AS WESTERN ECONOMIES STAGNATE
Josef Poeschl, Czech specialist at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies (WIIW) said that the immediate problem was the poor economic performance of West European economies.
""It is an economic law that if a stagnating economy is trading with a growing one, the latter will be faced with a deterioration of the trade balance,"" he said.
Poeschl suggested imposing temporary import surcharges and higher taxation on some commodities which are mostly imported.
""But if the Czech deficit does not shrink, a devaluation (of the Czech crown) will remain the only way out.""
WORRIES ARE EXAGGERATED, EXPORTS WILL GROW NEXT YEAR
Some economists said the government should not panic.
""The increase of the trade deficit will stop in 1997 at 150 to 160 billion crowns,"" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Prague's Komercni Banka.
In 1997, the first effects of an investment wave will be felt, boosted by reviving demand on EU markets, especially the acceleration of economic growth in Germany, he said.
The Czechs will also benefit from a partial re-orientation of exporters toward neighbouring post-communist countries and the former Soviet Union.
Janacek said there will be a market-based weakening of the crown, from currently above parity with the central bank mark/dollar basket to below parity in the first half of 1997.
""This will help to accelerate exports, and to slow down imports,"" he said.
DEVALUATION WOULD DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD
""We think the country's trade deficit will likely stabilise in 1997...so, as you can guess, we have plenty to say about what the government shouldn't do,"" said Boris Gomez, analyst at ING Barings in Prague.
He pointed to a positive, yet gradual shift of exports from commodities to sophisticated finished goods, and development of eastern export markets with higher economic growth potential.
A crown devaluation ""is not a painless cure and would do more damage than good to the small and open Czech economy that is heavily dependent on imports at this stage"".
It would ""generate a wage-price spiral"" and hurt credibility, Gomez said. Import surcharges would also sap the economy of needed modernisation.",0
"Czech President Vaclav Havel on Thursday said he was deeply disturbed by a Chinese court's 11-year prison sentence on dissident Wang Dan who was accused of plotting to overthrow the government.
Havel, himself a former dissident against a Communist government, said in a statement that after the 14-year sentence last December against Wei Jingsheng, a leader of China's small democracy movement, Wang's sentence was ""unacceptable"".
Wang, 27, was sentenced to 11 years in prison on Wednesday after a brief hearing. Wei was sentenced to 14 years in jail last December on a similar charge.
Havel said in the statement issued by his spokesman, that Wang's sentence ""was another example of the unacceptable understanding of the position of the citizen in society.""
The statement added that Havel expressed his ""deep dissatisfaction"" over the decision.
It said Havel ""considers it his obligation to express his solidarity with those who anywhere around the world express, in a non-violent way, their free-mindedness and desire for justice and elementary human rights.""
Havel, once a dissident playwright imprisoned several times by a Communist government before its fall in 1989, has been a frequent diplomatic thorn in China's side.
The Czech president said earlier this year he regretted that Taiwan, which Bejing regards as a renegade province, is not a U.N. member. However, the Czechs officially still recognise only China as a sovereign state and not Taiwan.
Havel angered China last year with a highly publicised meeting with Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan, forcing a hurried re-statement of the Czechs' official ""One-China Policy"".
Earlier on Thusday, the Czech foreign ministry asked China's chief diplomat in Prague, charge' d'affaires Wang Zizhen, to the ministry where a statement of protest was read.
""The Czech Republic expresses its dissatisfaction over the conduct of the trial and the judgment carried out,"" said a text of the statement issued by the foreign ministry.
It said that although there were differences in traditions of understanding questions of human rights in different regions, ""there exist certain universal principles of maintaining human rights which are necessary to respect"".
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said in Beijing that the jailing was not a human rights issue but an ordinary legal matter.
The Czech ministry statement said criminalisation of freedom of speech was ""a violation of elementary human rights"".",0
"The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Friday cut its forecast for 1996 real gross domestic product (GDP) growth as lower export demand, especially from neighbouring Germany, fuels the trade deficit and eases Czech expansion.
The CSU cut its full-year 1996 GDP projection to 4.8 percent growth -- the same as the real result for 1995 -- from its 5.1 percent year-on-year prognosis made at the beginning of August.
Czech GDP grew a real 4.3 percent in the first half of this year, according to the latest results.
In its report on Friday, the CSU said it expected full year 1997 real GDP growth at between 5.1 to 5.6 percent.
The CSU revised its forecast for the full-year 1996 current account deficit to 6.9 percent of GDP from 5.7 percent as a ballooning merchandise trade deficit continues to bite.
It said the current account deficit would grow to between 6.8 to 7.4 percent of GDP in 1997.
The bureau said the merchandise trade deficit would grow to 163.3 billion crowns by end-1996 from the roughly 111 billion crown deficit posted for the first three quarters this year and compared with roughly 96 billion crowns for the whole of 1995.
But the bureau said export growth should accelerate in 1997 to between 10.0 to 11.4 percent from 6.2 percent this year, while import growth would be between 14 to 16.2 percent next year from 15.4 percent in 1996.
It forecast the 1997 merchandise trade deficit at 200 to 210 billion crowns.
""It is realistic to forecast, in view of the massive investment into the (Czech) economy in the past several years and expected growth of (EU) economies... that the development of the (current account deficit) at the turn of 1997-98 would switch toward (the deficit's) reduction,"" the CSU said.
The bureau blamed mainly a stagnation in the first three quarters in the German economy -- which accounts for just over a third of Czech export demand -- and in the whole EU for the revised trade figures and the lower GDP forecast.
""I think it's realistic to suggest that the (Czech trade situation) won't be much different next year,"" said Charles Robertson an independent East Europe analyst.
""But the big question will be whether there will be some improvement toward the end of next year. If this carries on into 1998 and 1999 there are going to be big worries.""
He expected that, despite the poor trade results, the Czech crown should be able to stay within the central bank's band of plus/minus 7.5 percent from the mid-point of the mark/dollar basket to which it is fixed each day.
After the CSU announcement, the crown remained steady, trading in a tight range around the central bank's Friday fixing at 26.960 to the dollar and 17.739 to the mark, or 2.75 percent above parity with the basket.
The CSU slightly eased its forecast for full-year 1996 inflation to 8.9 percent from 9.0 percent in August, and said consumer prices would slow to between 7.5 percent to 8.0 percent for the whole of next year.
It said unemployment would remain at one of the lowest levels in Europe, but said it would edge up slightly to between 3.3 to 3.5 percent by the end of 1997 from 3.3 percent at the end of this year.
The slowdown of inflation -- to an average of 7.5 to 8.0 percent by the end of 1997 from 8.9 percent at the end of 1996 -- would be helped by a slowing in real wage growth to between 8.1 to 8.5 percent next year from 9.1 percent in 1996, the CSU said.",0
"Czech economic growth should slow
in 1997, before accelerating again as an ailing foreign trade
balance improves, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), said on Thursday.
Czech inflation, it said, should ease a bit in 1997 and
more decisively the following year.
In its twice-yearly report, the Paris-based organisation of
the world's most industrialised countries forecast gross
domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 4.6 percent next year
from 4.8 percent in 1996 but then rise to 5.3 percent in 1998.
""Growth is projected to become better balanced with
investment expected to continue to grow at double digit rates
and household consumption playing a smaller role in GDP
growth,"" the report said.
The current account deficit as a percentage of GDP would
dip to 5.4 percent in 1997 from 5.8 percent this year, but then
ease to 4.9 percent of GDP in 1998, it said.
Export growth should accelerate to 7.5 percent year-on-year
in 1997 and 8.7 percent in 1998 from 5.5 percent this year,
while import growth should slow to 9.5 percent in the next two
years from 11.3 percent.
""The foreign (trade) balance is expected to improve since
import growth will weaken while exports should recover from the
recent slowdown in line with the projected economic recovery in
the main export markets,"" the OECD said.
The Czech National Bank however has warned that the
country's current account deficit could grow to as much as
seven percent of gross domestic product in 1996.
The OECD said annual inflation should slow to 8.5 percent
in 1997 and 7.5 percent in 1998 from 9.1 percent this year.
As consolidation continues in the economy, unemployment
should rise to 3.6 percent next year and 4.1 percent in 1998
from about three percent this year, still one of the lowest
rates in the industrialised world.
It said ""higher labour productivity and projected wage
moderation will have a favourable effect on price dynamics, but
the inflation rate will still be higher than the OECD average
by the end of the projection period.""
But the OECD, which the Czechs joined at the end of 1995,
warned of risks if real wage growth fails to moderate after
growing faster than productivity over the last three years.
""The consumption boom could continue and, despite the
announced fiscal prudence, the trade deficit could widen
further,"" it said.

"Czech Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, a deputy premier and leader of a junior partner in the ruling coalition, quit the government and parliament on Tuesday for falsely using an academic title, the CTK news agency said.
Another member of parliament from a coalition party also quit parliament for the same reason, while three other deputies admitted using false titles but did not step down.
Kalvoda, aged 43, resigned for falsely claiming he was a Doctor of Law amid a growing row over the academic credentials of Czech politicians after deputies began questioning whether they were all genuine.
""Yes, (Kalvoda resigned) and he delivered his resignation to the president,"" Mariana Cerna of the parliament's press office told Reuters.
Officials of Kalvoda's party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), were not immediately available for comment, and it was not yet clear who would take Kalvoda's place in the cabinet or what his status would be within his party.
He told the house however that there would be no changes in the party, CTK reported.
ODA's press department said it would not comment until a meeting of party leaders on Wednesday.
Kalvoda, who headed the most pro-business party in the coalition, often bumped heads with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus on issues such as speeding up the deregulation of heating prices and rents and lowering taxes.
Earlier on Tuesday, Pavla Jurkova, a member of another coalition party, the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), resigned her seat in the 200-seat lower house -- where the centre-right coalition has 99 seats -- for falsely claiming a law doctorate.
Meanwhile two members of Vaclav Klaus's senior party in the three-member coalition, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), also admitted today that their law doctorates, used in campaign material earlier this year, were false, CTK said.
However Anna Roeschova and Ondrej Zemina had not resigned their seats, CTK reported.
Also staying put in parliament was a member of the opposition Social Democrats, Marie Noveska, after admitting she had not finished university but still used the title doctor of law.",0
"The Czech Republic has its first Senate since before World War Two, but an electoral win by the governing coalition appeared to have smothered talk of early general elections.
The three centre-right coalition parties took 52 seats in the new upper house of parliament on Saturday, but voter turnout of only 30 percent confirmed surveys showing many believe the Senate, with limited powers, is unneccessary.
Still, the result marked something of a turnaround for the coalition, central Europe's last centre-right government, which lost its majority in the more powerful lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, six months ago.
The Senate, written into the new 1993 constitution when Czechoslovakia split into separate Czech and Slovak states but not given authority until this year, was designed to be the reincarnation of the body of elder statesmen who sat in Prague until the Nazi invasion in 1939.
Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won 32 seats ahead of the strongest opposition party, the Social Democrats, with 25.
But Klaus dampened speculation that his conservative minority government might use the victory this weekend to seek an early vote to the lower house.
While leaving his party's headquarters late on Saturday, Klaus was asked if the results confirmed his opinion, given after last week's first-round Senate vote, that early elections to the lower house should not be necessary.
""I think they did,"" he told Reuters. He did not elaborate.
His three-party conservative coalition won 52 seats after this weekend's runoffs for the 81-seat Senate.
After last week's first-round Senate vote, which gave Klaus's Civic Democratic Party the potential to win up to 79 seats, Klaus told Czech Television: ""This country does not need another (lower house) election. It needs to function, work.""
The opposition Social Democrats won 25 Senate seats, while the junior coalition parties, the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL) and Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won 13 and seven seats respectively.
Analysts once viewed the Senate elections as a gauge for whether the coalition or the opposition would be in a position to seek a majority in the lower house through an early poll.
But voter turnout of only 30 percent made it hard for anybody to draw conclusions on what might be the result if early elections to the more powerful lower house were called.
""Most importantly the Senate won't be one-coloured or two-coloured as was expected, but multi-coloured,"" said analyst Jiri Pehe of Prague's Open Media Research Institute.
The little-reformed Communists clinched two seats and two went to independents.",0
"Elections to the new Czech Senate over the next two weekends will only thicken the country's political fog, but an indecisive electorate has already been priced into the financial markets, analysts said on Monday.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has been stuck in an uneasy political co-habitation since his centre-right coalition fell two seats short of a majority in the lower house on a strong second place showing by the Social Democrats in June.
Analysts say the Senate elections should not signal any clear shift in the political winds, and the markets will be stuck wondering if the three-party conservative government can hang on for its four-year term which runs through the year 2000.
They say only an unexpected clear victory for the opposition Social Democrats over Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) would hurt the Czech crown or capital markets.
""The markets will definitely turn down (on a Social Democrat victory), same as in the (lower house) elections,"" said Vladimir Jaros, research director at Prague investment house Wood & Co.
But he added that market expectations ""are for ODS to win"".
Klaus and his team of economists and technocrats became standard-bearers for post-Communist reforms after taking power in 1992 with a 12-seat majority in the lower house.
The markets, pollsters and pundits were caught off guard when the Social Democrats -- who have been ambivalent to balanced budgets and privatisations -- did so well.
The crown fell a full percentage point on the June results, and the stock market lost more than four percent of its value before stabilising when a minority government was confirmed.
""I think investors (this time) have already included in their behaviour expectations of inconclusive results,"" said Zdenek Bakala, chairman of Prague-based Patria Finance.
ODS and the Social Democrats are running close in recent opinion polls at around 25 percent support each, after ODS won the June vote with 29.6 percent, with CSSD at 26.4 percent.
But since the Senate vote is a first-past-the-post poll in individual constituencies, forecasting victory is difficult when gauged only by available party preference surveys.
Local analysts see Klaus's ODS and its two coalition allies winning a majority of the Senate's 81 seats, but they do not expect a result giving the coalition or opposition a clear advantage to push for an early election in the lower house.
""I don't think we are going to be facing a risk of extraordinary (lower house) elections, and I doubt that ODS will be willing to take that risk,"" Jaros said.
The two-round Senate polls, beginning on Friday with runoffs the next weekend, are not likely alter the course of the country's legislative agenda.
The stock market and the Czech crown have had diverging fates since the June vote, for reasons beyond election fears.
The crown has remained strong, despite a growing trade gap, consistently trading in a tight range between 2.5 to 3.0 percent above the central bank's mark/dollar basket.
The crown got a boost in October when four Social Democrats crossed over to vote with the government in approving the first draft of the 1997 budget.
Meanwhile, the Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) has been rocked, not by the political situation, but by discontent from foreign investors unhappy with the country's opaque trading environment.
The PSE's official PX50 index has been on a steady slide since late summer, dipping below 500 last week, heading toward its historic record low of 387.
Few think the Senate elections will serve to revive the securities markets, as market reform is not a high priority.",0
"Czech President Vaclav Havel, the only man who can smoke next to militant Hollywood anti-smoker Barbra Streisand, is facing a life without his beloved cigarettes after surgery revealed a cancerous lung.
Havel's heavy smoking is a fixture of his Bohemian intellectual image, but it is widely believed that it caused the malignant tumour which was radically removed on Monday.
It certainly startled some Czechs who awoke on Tuesday to a huge headline in the tabloid Blesk which simply bleated ""CANCER"" next to an archive picture of a happily-smoking Havel.
But just as Boris Yeltsin's multiple by-pass heart surgery will hardly dry up a Muscovite's taste for vodka, which many blamed for the Russian president's ills, Havel's surgery probably will not cause chain-smoking Czechs to kick the habit.
""Ooh, I should quit,"" said Hana Haskova, a 19-year-old student reacting to news of Havel's cancer. ""Well, I probably won't, but I'll be forced to think about it when I smoke.""
Doctors said the surgery, which cost the 60-year-old Havel half of his right lung, gave him good prospects for a full recovery, and he might return to work soon after the new year.
But his spokesman said that Havel, a multiple-pack-a-day man, will probably be limited to being a ""holiday smoker lighting up once a week with afternoon coffee.""
The world sees Havel like this -- the mustached but impish Bohemian philospher-playwright crumpled in a sweater, cigarette smoke pouring from his fingers as he mulls life's problems.
His dissident musings from a prison cell won the respect of the western world and helped spark Prague's non-violent 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"" over communism.
""Vaclav Havel is the only person who can smoke in my presence,"" said Barbra Streisand, one of America's prominent anti-smokers, at a Washington picnic last year in honour of the visiting Czech President.
The unlikely rise from prison to Prague Castle made Havel one of the most famous unabashed public smokers.
But news of Havel's cancer confirmed what many here feared when he entered hospital last week with an alleged case of pnuemonia -- his ubiquitous smoking caught up with him.
Czech surgeon Dr. Pavel Pafko said after performing the operation that it would be difficult to pinpoint smoking as the primary cause of Havel's cancer.
""The composition of this tumour is problematic in relation to smoking. You can't definitely tell,"" Pafko told reporters.
But to many Czechs, the cause was clear:
""It has to be the smoking,"" was the oft-repeated phrase of workers in central Prague, many of them smokers.
""Stopping now won't help anyway. I was smoking before you were born,"" said Karel, 43, a maintenence man puffing away over beer in one of the hundreds of Prague's smoke-blanketed pubs.
Dr. Pavko said Havel smoked one last pre-surgery cigarette with Jan Strasky, a chain smoker who happens also to be minister of health, whose warning on smoking's link to cancer is on every legally-sold pack of cigarettes in the country.
Havel, as many Czechs, came of age smoking heavy Communist cigarettes, and has moved to more expensive western brands.
A country of 10 million people smokes 23 billion cigarettes each year. Consumption has grown from five cigarettes per day to more than six averaged out for every man, woman, and child.
Amid an influx of western brands -- U.S. Philip Morris bought a controlling stake in the former monopoly state tobacco packager, and has made Marlboro a status symbol -- Havel vetoed measures to regulate public smoking and cigarette advertising.
The president once also was blamed for a nuclear alert by lighting up while touring a power plant, but an official re-enactment of the incident declared it was photographers' flashes, not Havel's smoke, which set off the alarm.",0
"The Czech crown firmed from the central bank fixing on Thursday, building on gains after a strong showing of the senior coalition party in Senate elections last weekend and prospects for the second round vote.
Analysts said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's pro-business Civic Democratic Party (ODS) was expected to take a majority of the 81 seats in the newly-created Senate after runoff elections this weekend should keep the crown firm.
The crown was trading mid-afternoon on Thursday at 26.661 to the dollar and 17.757 to the mark, or 3.05 percent above the Czech National Bank's dollar/mark basket.
""Mostly the expectations are that the ODS will win a majority in the Senate which I think is fairly likely,"" Citibank economist Radek Maly said.
The ODS already won three seats outright last Saturday and has 76 candidates through to the runoff this Friday and Saturday in the 77 constituencies remaining to be contested.
The crown, despite a ballooning trade deficit, has remained above well above parity with the basket, and has this week strengthened from last Friday's level of +2.45 percent.
Maly said he saw the currency staying close to Thursday's levels, and possibly getting a further bump up on Monday.
""I would personally see this level until the vote... Perhaps Monday we will see a similar situation, a quick strengthening, a quick speculative reaction,"" he said.
Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskovslovenska Obchodni Banka, said that despite voter turnout of only 35 percent in the first round of the elections, the market was still firming on the ODS showing.
""There will be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,"" he said. ""More or less the basic impulse for that is really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.""
The Senate has limited political power, but the vote would at least confirm that ODS had not suffered a further loss of confidence after the coaltion saw its majority in the more-powerful lower house evaporate in June general elections.
This week the Prague Stock Exchange has shown its first signs of life since the summer. 
Meanwhile fixed income and crown deposit investors are getting more confident that Klaus's tight fiscal and monetary policies will not be threatened.
""Those who want to play the interest rate differential (with foreign currencies) feel quite comfortable right now,"" Korous said.",0
"The Czech engineering company CKD Holding a.s. said on Thursday that it had won two contracts totalling roughly $200 million to supply trams to the city of Manila in the Philipines.
The order by Manila's MRTC for trams to be used in its massive new mass transit project -- and to be produced at the CKD Tatra plant in Prague -- is welcome news to Czech industry which has been reeling from a rapidly expanding trade deficit.
""The object of the contracts is the supply of large-capacity trams to Manila,"" CKD spokesman Vaclav Brom told Reuters adding the order was for more than 70 large tram units.
The Czech Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued concurrently that the CKD contract was part of a ""package of contracts"" with Japan's Sumitomo Corp and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as general suppliers for the project.
CKD said one contract was for the supply of trams totalling $104 million, the assembly of which would begin in the second half of 1997 with supply scheduled for sometime in 1998.
The second contract was a joint 10-year contract in which CKD would be responsible for maintenance and technical assistance for the trams along with training of the drivers, while Sumitomo would maintain the tracks and the depots.
The maintenance contract is worth $95 million to the Czech side alone, CKD said.
The Czech foreign ministry said the contracts were signed last week with the owner of the Manila project, MRTC.
""(The contracts' signing), in cooperation with the Japanese partners, open for Czech suppliers of tram units the possibility to penetrate into other Asia markets as well,"" the Czech foreign ministry said in a statement.
It said that Indonesia and the Peoples' Republic of China, were strong prospects for CKD trams, ""especially since Mitsubishi does not produce trams, and with success in Manila, is prepared to coooperate with CKD.""
The Czech merchandise trade deficit grew to a record eight-month total of 100 billion (corrects from million) crowns from January to August, the same as for the whole of 1996.
Many analysts see the Czech electric rail industry, which supplied trams for decades to the countries of the former Soviet Bloc, as a potential area where the country can narrow its yawning trade gap.",0
"Germany and the Czech republic will initial a long-awaited declaration on post-World War Two reconciliation between their two states on Friday in Prague, the Czech foreign ministry said on Monday.
A ceremony ending the two-year-long talks on the text will be held with Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and Germany's Klaus Kinkel in the first part of a three-stage confirmation.
The ministry said in a statement that the two would ""sign a protocol on the completion of negotiations of the Czech-German Declaration of mutual relations and their future development"".
The full declaration, leaked to news media last week, contains mutual expressions of regret for the Nazi occupation from 1938 to 1945 and for excessive brutality during the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans from former Czechoslovakia.
The text angered groups representing families of expelled Germans, known as Sudeten Germans, who complained that it did not compensate those who lost property during the expulsions.
But the Christian Social Union (CSU), the political sponsors of the Sudeten Germans, signalled on Monday it would no longer oppose the agreed text.
""By and large, the declaration will stand,"" Finance Minister and CSU chairman Theo Waigel told reporters.
The Bavarian-based CSU has in the past hinted it could use its weight in the government to block the declaration or oppose the Czech Republic's application to join the European Union unless the Sudeten Germans were given better terms.
But Waigel said it was a ""great success"" that Prague had gone as far as it had in apologising for the expulsions.
In the Czech parliament the mainstream parties have backed the declaration, but the extreme-right Republican Party and far-left Communists have ruled out voting for it in any form.
Members of the largest Czech opposition party, the Social Democrats, whose votes may be crucial for approval by parliament, said on Sunday that they still had concerns about vaguely-worded compensation for victims of Nazi aggression.
""(The party) has done all it can for the declaration to be accepted, but it still expects a bit more work (on the text),"" a Social Democrat senator from the once German-annexed district of Upper Moravia, Petr Moravek, told Czech Television.
Stanislav Gross, the head of the Social Democrat caucus in the house, was quoted in the daily Pravo on Monday as saying he would not vote for the declaration in its present form.
The declaration sets up a Czech-German Future Fund with the German side paying in 140 million marks ($90 million), and the Czechs paying about one-seventh of that.
The text says the fund is to finance ""projects of common interest"" including joint environmental, historical, and scientific projects, youth meetings, and partnership projects.
But the text adds that: ""The German side acknowledges its obligation of responsibility to all who became victims of National-Socialist violence. That is why the projects, wherever appropriate, should work mainly for the benefit of the victims of National-Socialist violence.""
Diplomats said privately that the signing ceremony might take place somewhere outside Prague, but Czech officials said last week it would not take place in those areas which Germany annexed in 1938, known as the Sudetenland.
Prague is not part of the area Germany considered as the Sudetenland.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to visit the Czech Republic, probably on January 21 and 22, to sign the text with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
In early February Czech President Vaclav Havel and German President Roman Herzog are expected to address the parliaments of each other's countries in ceremonies giving final approval to the declaration.",0
"Czech Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda, a deputy premier and leader of a junior partner in the ruling coalition, quit the government and parliament on Tuesday for falsely using an academic title, the CTK news agency said.
Kalvoda, aged 43, resigned for falsely claiming he was a doctor of law amid a growing row over the academic credentials of Czech politicians after deputies began questioning whether they were all genuine.
""Yes, (Kalvoda resigned) and he delivered his resignation to the president,"" Mariana Cerna of the parliament's press office told Reuters.
Another member of parliament from a party in the centre-right ruling coalition also quit the house for the same reason, while three other deputies admitted using false titles but did not step down, the news agency reported.
Officials of Kalvoda's party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), were not immediately available for comment, and it was not yet clear who would take Kalvoda's place in the cabinet or what his status would be within his party.
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, head of the senior Civic Democratic Party, said he would meet on Wednesday morning with Christian Democrat chairman Josef Lux and a designated member of Kalvoda's party to assess the situation in the three-party coalition.
""It's a political swerve, it's disquieting and unsettling, and the aim of all of us is that it would happen without any teetering,"" Klaus told reporters after Kalvoda's resignation.
ODA's press department said it would not comment until a meeting of its party leaders on Wednesday.
Kalvoda, who headed the most pro-business party in the coalition, often bumped heads with Klaus on issues such as speeding up the deregulation of heating prices and rents and lowering taxes.
Pavla Jurkova, a member of the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), resigned her seat in the 200-seat lower house -- where the centre-right coalition has 99 seats -- for falsely claiming a law doctorate, CTK said.
Two members of Klaus's party also admitted that their law doctorates, used in campaign material earlier this year, were false, CTK said, but Anna Roeschova and Ondrej Zemina had not resigned their seats.
Also staying put in parliament was a member of the opposition Social Democrats, Marie Noveska, after admitting she had not finished university but still used the title doctor of law.",0
"The head of the Czech Republic's largest bank is on a crusade to clean up the emerging post-communist banking sector from within and, he hopes, from a seat in the Senate.
Dr Richard Salzmann, the bow-tied president of Komercni Banka, says the Czech banking system is fundamentally sound and getting stronger despite a handful of recent failures among smaller institutions.
But, he says, the whole Czech economy needed a dose of ""fairness and transparency"" to clean up old habits of secrecy and ensure banks are not run as private fiefdoms.
He is standing for a seat in the newly-established Czech Senate at elections in November, saying he wants to help bring back ""good manners"" to the banking industry and restore the reputation of the Czech finance sector.
Better risk management is crucial, according to Salzmann.
He said that Komercni and the three other large banks -- which comprise about 80 percent of all Czech banking activity -- had bolstered their reserves to meet Western banking standards, and had developed more effective risk management techniques.
""As concerns ""The Big Four', (the situation) is, for sure, very good, because all these big four banks in the last years have built up huge reserves,"" Salzmann said during a visit to the PGA Czech Open golf tournament here recently.
""It's true that we have an unusually high proportion of risky loans in our portfolios, which is partially inherited from the past. Other (bad loans) were made in this era of euphoria, after the (1989 revolution ending Communism).""
He said from branches to front office, Komercni has stepped up risk management techniques which have now been also adopted by Ceska Sporitelna,  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, and Investicni a Postovni Banka -- the others in ""The Big Four"".
""Now we are in the final stage when we are building a central risk assessment department, which supervises all kinds of risks, not only from credit but also from the capital market operations and from the foreign operations.""
FAILURES EXPOSE PROBLEMS
Salzmann said he believed the recent failure of Kreditni Banka a.s., a medium-sized bank which became the eighth to shut in the post-communist era, stemmed, like others before it, from greed and naivete.
""I would blame mostly the founders of the banks, because they provided for themselves various kinds of privileges. They were, in most cases in my opinion, those who did not come with the intention to rob the money and disappear or something like that, I don't say that,"" Salzmann contended.
""But many of them founded the bank with false ideas that (their) bank would be able to provide themselves with easier conditions and lower prices for money for their internal use.""
Salzmann said these bad lending practices spiraled until the banks were forced to raise their rates and tighten lending conditions for regular customers.
""This snowballed from the naivete at the beginning,"" he said.
Kreditni suffered losses reportedly at more than 10 billion Czech crowns ($381.1 million) through a series of large loan defaults and on August 8 the central bank withdrew its banking licence.
The local press has been ripe with allegations of mismanagement and murky loan operations at many of the failed institutions, but criminal investigations have yet to produce any charges.
Officials from Kreditni Banka have refused to comment on reasons for its failure, but its controlling shareholder, the large insurer Ceska Pojistovna, chalked it up simply to bad decisions by bank management on loans and loan guarantees.
Salzmann, 67, said problems in the banking system were part of a bigger problem of honesty and fairness throughout the economy.
He said that if elected, he would push to expand the enforcement power of regulators to police dubious practices in banks, investment funds, and on the capital market, which is consistently hampered by charges of insider trading.
BANKER SEEKS POLITICAL PLATFORM
""My (candidacy), is to bring to this freshly-introduced capitalism more decency...a better field for good business,"" said Salzmann.
The erudite banker, who often recalls the days of thriving Czech capitalism between wars, said he would work in the Senate to establish an independent capital market watchdog like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Salzmann resigned as the chairman of the Prague Stock Exchange earlier this year -- a mostly honorary position -- to allow his friend and party colleague Tomas Jezek to take over as a full-time, hands-on leader of the bourse.
Both Jezek and Salzmann will run for the Senate in separate constituencies, and both support starting up a market-supported watchdog beefed up from the currently understaffed and underfunded Finance Ministry regulation department.
But Salzmann, who said he cannot by contract retire from the bank for at least one more year, rejects charges that his membership in the Senate while heading the country's largest banking group would constitute a conflict of interest. There is no legal requirement in the Czech Republic for legislators to suspend their business interests when they enter parliament.
Salzmann insists he would never use his Senate seat to gain advantages for his bank, but he makes no apologies about using his seat to try to improve the banking and business environment overall.
""I will support all such measures to bring more fairness, decency, good manners, transparency, all those principals which are, of course, favourable for the banks. So in that sense I will be perhaps in a conflict of interest,"" Salzmann said.
When asked if that meant he would support laws which would separate the banks and their investment arms, many of which control major chunks of the Czech economy -- like at Komercni Banka -- Salzmann answered:",0
"Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik on Monday, for the second week in a row, skipped a meeting with the Prague bourse's governing chamber, amid growing calls for his ministry to tackle problems in Czech securities trading.
""At two o'clock (Kocarnik) cancelled his participation in this afternoon's meeting,"" Prague Stock Exchange (PSE) spokesman Milan Vodicka told Reuters.
The bourse's Chamber, which has been seeking stronger ministry action to ease investors' concerns about market transparency, later declined Kocarnik's return invitation for a ""future"" meeting at his ministry.
The meetings had been scheduled to discuss taking tougher regulatory action to address concerns of transparency and insider trading on Czech capital markets.
Jiri Spicka, director of the Finance Ministry's banking division, told Reuters that Kocarnik was ""too busy with the preparation of the state budget"" and ""it was impossible for him to leave the ministry"".
The budget has been expected for weeks to go to the floor of parliament for its second reading in the session which begins on Tuesday.
Kocarnik then invited the 18-member Chamber to his ministry for a ""future"" meeting, Spicka said.
The Chamber later declined that invitation, an official at the office of Chamber Chairman Tomas Jezek told Reuters.
Jezek lambasted Kocarnik on Sunday for lax regulation of the capital markets during the annual national congress of the ruling Civic Democratic Party, of which both men are members.
Jezek told the party meeting that the reluctance of finance ministry officials to more strongly regulate the capital markets was ""absurd"" and investors' lack of confidence could eventually do major damage the country's balance of payments.
""The capital account of our payments balance is alreday unable to level with a growing deficit in our trade balance, and the capital market needs to gain back the lost confidence,"" Jezek was quoted by the daily Pravo as saying.
Jezek warned that poor capital market regulation might even force a devaluation of the crown if confidence is not restored.
Jezek is leading plans to set up an independent markets watchdog akin to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), funded by transaction fees, by the middle of next year.
The finance ministry has balked at the plan, but Jezek is widely believed to have the backing of the parliament's budget committee which he has said will probably submit legislation permitting a Czech SEC to be set up in the first half of 1997.
Kocarnik has rejected criticism that his ministry is failing in its responsibility to properly regulate the system, and says stronger regulations would be ""anti-market"".
Still, foreign and domestic investors have repeatedly called for steps to beef up the supervision of the Czech capital market, and the ministry has said it is considering its own plan to re-regulate securities trading.
Richard Salzmann, chairman of the largest Czech bank Komercni Banka a.s., told Pravo that ""none of the more important groups want to trade on this capital market.""",0
"Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus kept his options open on whether the domination of his Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in this weekend's first round of Senate elections might encourage a quest for a larger mandate.
As results for the new upper house came in late on Saturday, Klaus reserved comment on possibly using his party's strength in the Senate races as a signal to seek new elections to the lower house in order to win back a majority government.
Klaus's ODS won 36.47 percent of the total vote on Saturday in the first test since his conservative three-party coalition lost its majority in June lower-house elections when the Social Democrats (CSSD) posted a surprising second place result.
This time the opposition CSSD won just 20.27 percent of the vote after falling about three percentage points short of the ODS's 29.6 percent in June. But voter turnout this time was very light making it difficult to draw broad conclusions.
Klaus, who like all ministers sits in the lower house, hedged his bets on possible early lower house elections.
""I've said many times this country does not need another election. It needs to function, work,"" Klaus said in a panel discussion on Czech Televisoin after the vote.
But he added: ""If the Senate vote gives a chance to go forward, it'll be good for all of us.""
The ODS put 76 candidates through to next weekend's runoff elections out of the 81 constituencies, and won three seats outright by taking more than 50 percent of the vote.
In 73 districts, ODS had the top candidate go into the runoff, while CSSD had 48 candidates in a runoff, but won no seats outright and had nobody on top in any constiuency.
Exactly seven years since the revolution which would end Communism began, only about one in three eligible Czechs voted, less than half the turnout for the previous three lower-house elections since the 1989 revolution.
Analysts said many Czechs felt that the upper house, which will have limited legislative powers and act more as an advisory body, was redundant.
Pre-election opinion polls showed many people did not did not know who was running in their district, and there was a wide misunderstanding of the two-round voting system.
But no one really knows how the dynamics will change in next weekend's runoffs or if turnout will improve.
""The situation is not as rosy as it may appear..."" cautioned ODS party vice-chairman, Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec even after the strong result for ODS was apparent.
Analysts said that it would be too soon to declare the first round vote an unmitigated success for ODS, as the second round will be much more polarised and the choices between two candidates instead of many will be distinct.",0
"The Czech crown firmed on Thursday to its highest level against its mark/dollar basket, buoyed by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus' comments that devaluation was not needed despite a widening trade gap.
By mid-morning the crown moved to around 4.3 percent above its daily parity rate set by the Czech National Bank (CNB) against the dollar/mark basket from a four percent level in the morning.
The crown stood at 26.005 to the dollar and 17.600 to the mark at 1130 GMT.
The CNB followed the market up, fixing the crown 4.24 percent above parity with the basket after +3.9 percent on Wednesday.
Dealers said the crown could challenge 4.5 percent against parity before levelling off to end the week.
""Probably we will attack 4.5 percent (over parity),"" Tomas Becvar, dealer at Prague's Komercni Banka, told Reuters.
Although the Czech trade balance earlier this week showed a record monthly deficit in July of 16.4 billion crowns, the market was encouraged by Klaus's comments.
""The first (reason for the crown's rise) is Klaus's comments in Austria,"" Becvar said. ""Another reason of course is the following of the market by the central bank at the fixing.""
At an economic conference in Austria, Klaus backed the CNB's Governor Josef Tosovsky view that a stronger crown would be better for the economy in the long-term.
""We think that a devaluation is not necessary and that it wouldn't be useful,"" Klaus told Reuters.
While some economists have recommended devaluing the crown to help the trade situation, many said it is not fundamentally necessary as capital inflows remain strong and the balance of services, especially toursim, softens the current account gap.
The Czech currency last dipped below the parity rate against the basket in mid-June, soon after elections stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority in parliament and strenghthend the hand of the opposition Social Democrats.
But since then, the Czech currency has been on a steady march up, first hovering around three percent against the basket, then surging after Tosovsky's comments last Friday.
Klaus was finally able to form a minority government of his centre-right coalition while the centre-left Social Democrats have been concilliatory on economic issues, including a 9.3 billion crown cut in spending to balance this year's budget.
Dealers said positive preliminary results on Thursday for July's industrial production, showing a moderate recovery from disappointing June figures, also helped the crown.",0
"Bitter infighting broke out among Czech Social Democrats on Friday only a month before elections in which the opposition party hopes to humiliate conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
Party chairman Milos Zeman denied there was any split in his party, which is running neck and neck with Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) before Senate elections next month.
But almost in the same breath he threatened to resign next spring unless a party deputy chairman who broke ranks to vote with the Klaus government last week went first.
Adding to his woes, a Social Democrat deputy threatened to leave the parliamentary party in a row with an ex-communist colleague, a move which could tip the balance of parliamentary power between the minority government and opposition.
Klaus, whose three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority in lower house elections earlier this year, has seemed under heavy pressure with opinion polls showing the Social Democrats level or slightly ahead of his ODS.
But just as the Social Democrats seemed in with a good chance of beating the ODS for the first time since the restoration of democracy, strife flared in opposition ranks.
Last week Jozef Wagner, the chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, led a revolt by four Social Democrat deputies which allowed the 1997 state budget to pass its first reading.
Tempers flared on Friday after Wagner threatened to resign from the parliamentary party unless another Social Democrat deputy, ex-communist Michal Kraus, quit the budget committee and a parliamentary commission investigating a bank collapse.
Despite the appearance of disarray in Social Democrat ranks, Zeman played down Wagner's threat. ""There is no real split. I do not want to overestimate the importance of his proclamation in this case,"" he told a news conference.
""A split would happen only if a body of opinion formed which was sharply different in questions of principle from the opinion of the party leadership,"" he said.
But then he attacked party deputy chairman Karel Machovec, one of the Wagner rebels. ""There should not be a person in the leadership who shows himself up by talking about disputes in the party,"" said Zeman.
Asked if he would resign if Machovec remained vice chairman after a party congress scheduled for next March, Zeman said: ""Yes. It is true, I can confirm that.""
Kraus, a communist deputy before the 1989 collapse of the East Bloc, accused the four budget rebels of being ""corrupted politically"" by the Klaus coalition.
Wagner told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes he would leave the Social Democratic parliamentary party or ""club"" if Kraus did not go. Machovec was quoted by local media as saying that if Wagner left, there would be a serious party split.
This could change the balance of power in the 200-seat lower house where the Social Democrats, along with the little-reformed Communists and the far-right Republicans, have 101 votes to the government's 99.
The Senate itself has few powers. But the elections on November 15 and 16, with a second round runoff a week later, have become a test of public opinion which could indicate whether early lower house elections are likely.
Analysts say that if the Social Democrats perform strongly, Zeman might be tempted to bring down the coalition to force lower house polls in which his party might overtake Klaus's ODS. But that depends on Zeman being able to maintain discipline.
So far voters do not seem concerned. A poll taken by the STEM agency before and after the budget vote showed the Social Democrats with 27.3 percent support ahead of ODS with 26.8.
In the lower house elections on May 31-June 1, ODS won 29.6 percent and the Social Democrats 26.4.",0
"The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus pulled ahead in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at just 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of Klaus's minority coalition government, candidates of his centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) topped voting in 66 of the 71 constituencies declared by mid-evening.
But most face a second round run-off on November 22-23 for the newly-created upper house, and analysts said the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
Nationwide figures were not available. But the Central Election Commission said turnout in 53 of the 81 constituencies had been just 34.27 percent.
This was far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections held in June.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance following his electoral disaster last June, when strong Social Democrat gains stripped his three-party coalition of its lower house majority.
""From the results so far it is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability,"" he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate which has stalled reform since the inconclusive lower house polls.
""These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal,"" he said.
Under the Senate rules, candidates who fail to win over half the first round vote have to face the runner-up in a second round. Most constituencies will be decided next weekend.
But already it appears the Social Democrats of economist Milos Zeman have done badly, failing to come out on top in a single constituency.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates.""
In the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent rally.
Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate, Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority, although he denies that.
But ODS is better at mobilising support than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.
""If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,"" said Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI).",0
"A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: ""Could you please tell me Mr. Novak's first name.""
Secretary (with no hesitation): ""Doctor.""
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles.
It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" which forced him to resign from cabinet on Tuesday in a shocking mea culpa on the floor of parliament.
""In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,"" Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute, said.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as ""Mr. Engineer"" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or ""Mr. Doctor"", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers to PhD'd journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised ""JUDr"" moniker in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one resigned from parliament, the three others so far have refused.
""I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,"" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of ""Dr."" for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title -- Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD) -- but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of title-envy stems from four decades of communism which ended with 1989's bloodless ""Velvet Revolution"" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml - a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and never was allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
""He made himself a name, not a title,"" Lidove Noviny wrote.",0
"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky on Friday said the central bank was committed to keeping the crown strong, despite some calls to devalue the appreciating currency to help exports.
Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and top business executives, Tosovsky said the central bank would keep the crown within the current band within which it fixes the currency daily against a mark/dollar basket.
""I said that we will try to keep the rate within the plus/minus 7.5 percent band (agains the mark/dollar cross rate),"" Tosovsky told reporters.
""I dismissed speculation that we would want to move the crown in some way outside the band,"" he added.
Analysts recently have been debating whether a devaluation of the crown might be needed to boost exports and help stem a ballooning current account deficit.
The trade deficit is threatening to send the current account shortfall to close to six percent of gross domestic product this year after about four percent last year.
Some have argued that a devaluation is still required to help the country's goods to remain competitive while wages are rising and the economy is still transforming.
But others have said that the foreign capital inflow is still comfortably paying for the imports, and the current account deficit is still not dangerous.
Tosovsky said a stable crown had served its purpose in regulating the country's inflation, and a stronger crown would have positive effects on reforming Czech industry to make it more competitive.
He said a stronger crown ""should help faster restructuring of our economy, to help increase the added-value faster...and to help to bring our country closer in productivity to the countries that we want to compare ourselves with.""
The latter was a clear reference to the European Union and especially neighbouring Germany.
The central bank fixes the crown daily within a band plus or minus 7.5 percent from the central parity of the mark/crown basket.
It has been fixing it recently at more than three percent above parity to match a modest net inflow from foreign crown buying.
After the meeting at a government chateau east of Prague, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that the government would aim to provide more funds to export promotion agencies such as the Czech Export Bank, and its sister export insurance agency.
He said he also told the business leaders that it was also necessary for businesses to lower their expectations of higher inflation because it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
""We can not automatically appease the expectation of, let's say, nine percent inflation, and make that the basis for all further expenditure -- price and wage items,"" Klaus said.
He said that this would be key to the government's position in collective bargaining.
""We have to radically break this (inflation expectation). This must be the basis of this year's debates on collective agreements.""",0
"The Czech ruling centre-right coalition agreed on Monday to name Vlasta Parkanova as justice minister, replacing Jan Kalvoda who resigned last month after he admitted to using an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" title.
But coalition leaders agreed to wait on the choice of a replacement for Kalvoda, who is chairman of a small right-wing junior coalition party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), in the more politically-sensitive post of deputy prime minister.
""We received an official proposal from the ODA for a new justice minister... as Doctor Parkanova. We approved this proposal by the ODA on the coalition level,"" Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, the head of the senior Civic Democratic Party (ODS), told a news conference.
After a meeting with his coalition partners Klaus said that Parkanova could be officially appointed by President Vaclav Havel as soon as Tuesday.
Parkanova, 45, a certified doctor of law, currently serves as a chief of staff at the Interior Ministry.
She would become the first woman to have a seat in the Prague government since the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993.
ODA vice chairman Karel Ledvinka said the coalition agreed to a request by his party to postpone nomination of the new deputy prime minister, who would lead the party in the tenuous minority cabinet, until after the party's congress in March.
Kalvoda's position as chairman of the pro-business ODA is also to be decided at the March party congress.
The ODA has four seats in the 16-member cabinet under a coalition agreement with the ODS and the centrist Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), plus one of four deputy premierships.
Kalvoda and the KDU-CSL leader Josef Lux have fought heated policy battles with Klaus's party, which controls half of the cabinet, but the coalition remains the longest-running conservative government in post-Communist Europe.
Tensions have been heightened since June when the coalition lost its majority in the lower house of parliament.
Kalvoda, a parliamentary deputy and a cabinet member since the coalition was formed in 1992, was the fifth member of parliament who admitted using the title of Juris Doctor without actually having qualified for it.
Out of the other four fake doctors, only one has resigned her parliamentary seat.",0
"Czech power producer CEZ a.s. on Friday said its nine month net profit hit 8.4 billion crowns, up from 7.4 billion for the same period last year, according to international accounting standards, as household electricity demand surged.
CEZ's Director of Planning and Analysis section Petr Voboril told a news conference that higher depriciation write-offs due to the opening of new installations cut the company's tax obligations, and boosting its bottom line.
The company's gross profit for the period remained flat at 13.1 billion.
Czech accounting put the firm's profit for the first nine months at 7.04 billion, up from 6.7 billion last year.
CEZ said the result did not change the firm's profit forecast under Czech standards for the whole year, which is 8.1 billion crowns, equal to last year's.
A financial statement showed CEZ wrote off 4.1 billion in the first nine months compared with 3.4 billion in the same period of 1995, and paid 4.7 billion in income tax after 5.7 billion last year.
""Above all, lowering of tax obligations in connection with depriciation policy have influenced this (profit) increase,"" Voboril said.
He said that overall demand for electricity rose by 5.5 percent in the period, and is expected to reach a record high of 55.3 terrawatthours, 6.1 percent up year-on-year, for the whole 1996.
Household consumption drove the increase, rising 10.5 percent, while large clients demanded almost two percent more power over the same period of the last year.
Voboril said that a recent ruling by the Finance Minstry on maximum prices CEZ can charge regional power distributors did not effect results thanks to the sales increase.
The ministry decided that the maximum average price CEZ can charge for supplies this year is 1,035 crowns per megawatthour, up two crowns from the last year but below the firm's 1,040 crown expectation included in business plan.
Voboril said that short-term indebtedness of CEZ increased as well as financial expenditures due to unpaid recievables from some of the eight regional distributors, which totalled 3.2 billion crowns as of September 30.
CEZ and six of the country's eight regional grid operators had been locked in a price dispute with CEZ until the ministry ruling last month.
CEZ is also considering an international bond issue next year as it needs financing but has already flooded the domestic market with paper, Voboril said.
Local analysts welcomed the results but said they did not expect them to help CEZ's share price much as the Prague Stock Exchange is plagued by a lack of confidence.

"Czech power producer CEZ a.s. on Friday said its nine month net profit hit 8.4 billion crowns ($312.6 million), up from 7.4 billion for the same period last year, according to international accounting standards, after household electricity demand surged.
CEZ's Director of Planning and Analysis section Petr Voboril told a news conference that higher depreciation write-offs due to the opening of new installations cut the company's tax obligations, and boosting its bottom line.
The company's gross profit for the period remained flat at 13.1 billion.
Czech accounting put the firm's profit for the first nine months at 7.04 billion, up from 6.7 billion last year.
CEZ said the result did not change the firm's profit forecast under Czech standards for the whole year, which is 8.1 billion crowns, equal to last year's.
A financial statement showed CEZ wrote off 4.1 billion in the first nine months compared with 3.4 billion in the same period of 1995, and paid 4.7 billion in income tax after 5.7 billion last year.
""Above all, lowering of tax obligations in connection with depriciation policy have influenced this (profit) increase,"" Voboril said.
He said that overall demand for electricity rose by 5.5 percent in the period, and is expected to reach a record high of 55.3 terrawatthours, 6.1 percent up year-on-year, for the whole 1996.
Household consumption drove the increase, rising 10.5 percent, while large clients demanded almost two percent more power over the same period of the last year.
Voboril said that a recent ruling by the Finance Minstry on maximum prices CEZ can charge regional power distributors did not effect results thanks to the sales increase.
The ministry decided that the maximum average price CEZ can charge for supplies this year is 1,035 crowns per megawatthour, up two crowns from the last year but below the firm's 1,040 crown expectation included in business plan.
Voboril said that short-term indebtedness of CEZ increased as well as financial expenditures due to unpaid debts from some of the eight regional distributors, which totalled 3.2 billion crowns as of September 30.
CEZ and six of the country's eight regional grid operators had been locked in a price dispute with CEZ until the ministry ruling last month.
CEZ is also considering an international bond issue next year as it needs financing but has already flooded the domestic market with paper, Voboril said.
Local analysts welcomed the results but said they did not expect them to help CEZ's share price much as the Prague Stock Exchange is plagued by a lack of confidence.
""The CEZ results are slightly better than I expected. CEZ is fundamentally undervalued but genereal market sentiment is not very strong,"" said Petr Dousa of Zivnostenska Banka. ""I don't expect the price to go up to 1,000 in the next few days.""

"A reporter's call to the new director's secretary at a major Czech industrial company went something like this:
Journalist: ""Could you please tell me Mr Novak's first name?""
Secretary, with no hesitation: ""Doctor.""
Czechs are obsessed with academic titles. It was Justice Minister Jan Kalvoda's use of an unattained ""Doctor of Law"" which forced him to resign from the cabinet on Tuesday in a confession on the floor of parliament.
""In this society having a title plays such a role -- whether or not you have a degree,"" said Jiri Pehe, the head of research at Prague's Open Media Research Institute.
Normal discussions in many offices begin with colleagues addressing each other as ""Mr Engineer"" -- a title of mid-level academic specialisation -- or ""Mr Doctor"", held by many Czechs from physicians to lawyers and PhD-holding journalists.
Kalvoda was once a practicing lawyer who did complete law school but did not finish the certification process required to become a doctor of law. His colleagues and his party began using the title in literature, and he never refuted it.
His resignation came on top of the confessions of four other deputies in the lower house of parliament who also used the unauthorised moniker, indicated by initials JUDr, in campaign material and biographies.
Apart from Kalvoda, only one has resigned from parliament, three others refusing to do so.
""I suspect that there may be a few more deputies or government officials in some positions who are claiming to have degrees which they in fact do not have,"" said Pehe, a PhD who did not insist on the use of ""Dr"" for this story.
The Czech prime minister, a highly-educated economist, has the full academic title of Professor Engineer Vaclav Klaus CSc (Candidate of Science, a former regional variation of PhD), but he does not inisist on its use by others.
Some of the title-envy stems from four decades of communism, which ended with 1989's bloodless ""Velvet Revolution"" led by a band of intellectuals and the dissident playwright Vaclav Havel.
Communist leaders insisted on an educated population, at least quantitatively, and even implemented programmes producing fast-brewed PhD's and engineers at colleges.
Kalvoda's resignation inspired commentaries on the subject of academic titles in Wednesday newspapers.
The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted an unnamed cabinet member as saying the only minister safe from title-fixing accusations was Interior Minister Jan Ruml -- a former dissident who the communists would never allow to attend college.
The daily Lidove Noviny used the Kalvoda incident to pay tribute to Havel, who became the country's president after the 1989 revolution.
Havel, as a dissident, was forced by the communists to work in manual jobs and was never allowed to study for a formal degree. He now has a truckload of honorary doctorates from universities worldwide.
""He made himself a name, not a title,"" Lidove Noviny wrote.",0
"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky said on Friday that there was no need to hurry the of the state's stake in the country's largest commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s..
He said when the time comes to sell the stake of some 49 percent it could be offered to several investors.
""There is not a need to hurry with (Komercni's) privatisation. A strategic partner is not necessary, so it is possible to propose to sell the state stake to more investors,"" Tosovsky said after a closed meeting of the parliament's banking commission.
But he added the central bank does not yet have a strong consensus on what to do with the stake.
""We haven't an absolutely firm opinion on this, it's possible (to sell) to both domestic and foreign investors.""
The central bank has submitted a broad plan to privatise shares in the so-called ""Big Four"" banks which calls for the merger of trade bank  Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. with Ceska Sporitlena a.s., the largest savings bank.
The CNB has said it would prefer to wait several years before privatising the state shares after the newly-merged bank is established to analyse effects of the merger.
""CSOB is ready for quite a fast privatisation, but when considered in a wider scope, we (the CNB) think that a merger with Ceska Sporitelna would be more suitable,"" Tosovsky said.
""If this proposal is accepted, privatisation would be... delayed, beause there must be the merger first.""
The Czech cabinet must approve any privatisation of shares in the Big Four banks, and this week they asked the central bank for more concrete details on the central bank's plan.
""(A merger of CSOB and Sporitelna) has a number of rational and economic reasons,"" Tosovsky said without elaborating.
The governor rejected comments by CSOB and Sporitelna executives who reacted coolly to the merger plan.
""The managements are not the owners... it's logical the managements have their own interests and preferences, but the owner is the (state National Property Fund),"" he said.
He said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had requested details to the central bank's plan for a quick sale of the state's 31.5 percent of Investicni a Postovni Banka a.s. to a strategic foreign partner.
""The prime minister proposed (for the CNB) to make concrete some procedings concerning mostly IPB so that the privatisation can start as soon as possible,"" Tosovsky said.
IPB executives have confirmed that both Japan's Nomura and Dutch ING Bank NV have shown an interest in acquiring shares in IPB.
Klaus has said he is not in favour of the CSOB/Sporitelna merger, equating it with melding Prague's two top soccer teams Sparta and Slavia, an idea unthinkable for most Czechs.",0
"The ""Big Four"" state-controlled Czech banks need owners who could secure their growth and international competitivness, a vice-governor of the Czech National Bank (CNB), Pavel Kysilka, said on Wednesday.
""We need strong, stable, sound and efficient banks able to compete on the European market,"" Kysilka told a banking seminar. ""Czech banks need owners who can meet that criteria.""
He said the CNB had fine-tuned its concept, submitted to the government last month, for selling the state's stakes in the country's four largest banks, after requests for clarification from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
Kysilka did not elaborate on what changes were made to the CNB's original concept.
The state holds 49 percent in Komercni Banka a.s., 45 percent in savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s., 66 percent in Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. (CSOB), and 31.5 percent in IPB a.s..
The parts of the original CNB plan which have already been been made public propose a quick selloff of the IPB stake, a merger of CSOB and Sporitelna with eventual privatisation of the single entity, and an incremental sale of Komercni shares.
The ultimate decision rests with the government which has yet to put forward its own plan. The CNB has said however that there is a broad consensus that the ""Big Four"" privatisations should go through, but the question is how.
Klaus has said he was opposed to the idea of a merger of CSOB and Sporitelna, which would create post-Communist Europe's largest bank with assets topping $20 billion
But Klaus and the Finance Ministry have agreed that the IPB stake should be sold quickly to a strategic foreign investor.
Local media have been ripe with speculation over which foreign partner is most likely to take the shares.
Japan-based Nomura, and Dutch ING Bank NV, are widely seen as front runners for the IPB stake.
The Czech private station TV Nova reported earlier this week that Dutch bank ABN Amro was also interested in buying into IPB.
On Wednesday, an ABN Amro spokesman said his bank viewed the report as ""market rumour"" and declined further comment.
Meanwhile, Klaus economic adviser Martin Kocourek was quoted as saying in the Czech daily Hospodarske Noviny on Wednesday that Union Bank of Switzerland  was looking to win a mandate to arrange the sale of IPB's stake.
CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky told Reuters last week however that the full cabinet had yet to discuss the central bank's plan but would do so in a few weeks time. He said only a few of the opinions from the government were known.
Kysilka told the confernce that the state-held stakes in the Big Four are now worth 50-60 billion crowns at market prices, after having negative value before the post-Communist banking reforms at the beginning of the 1990's.",0
"Czech  Ceska Rafinerska a.s. closed a cracking unit at its Litvinov refinery on Monday after the second fire in eight days struck the plant, company spokesman Ales Soukup said.
But he said the restoration of crude processing, which was halted after the first fire, would continue.
A fire broke out on Sunday night in a furnace of a cracking unit as crude flow resumed after an eight-day stoppage.
Oil flow had been halted since a blaze in another part of the refinery began on November 23 and lasted for more than two days. The latest fire was put out several hours after it started.
Soukup told Reuters that the current resumption of production at the refinery would continue as crude is diverted around the cracker.
The shutdown of the cracker would limit the content, not the amount, of processed crude, Soukup said.
""This (cracking) unit will be out of order for some time, and therefore the refinery will operate in a substitution regime. It will affect the depth of processing,"" he said.
The extent of damage at the refinery, near the northern town of Litvinov, has not yet been determined. Soukup said reopening the cracker ""was not a question of hours or days.""
An explosion in the refinery's tanking station on November 23 sent flames visible for several kilometres into the air and caused dense smoke to roll into neighbouring Germany.
Soukup said the causes and damage from both fires were under investigation.
After the earlier fire, officials from Rafinerska, petrol firms and the government decided that supplies from the Kralupy refinery and in the distribution network were sufficient in the short term, and state reserves would not be tapped.
In a deal completed last year, the IOC consortium of three foreign oil groups bought a 49 percent stake in Rafinerska, a company set up to operate the two main Czech refineries at Litvinov and Kralupy.
The IOC is equally owned by DuPont Co unit Conoco of the United States, Royal Dutch/Shell, and Italy's Agip SpA.
The state holds the remaining 51 percent stake in Rafinerska through the holding company Unipetrol a.s..",0
"Czech National Bank (CNB) Governor Josef Tosovsky on Friday said the central bank was committed to keeping the crown strong, despite some calls to depreciate the currency to help exports.
Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and top business executives, Tosovsky said the central bank would keep the crown within the current band against which it fixes the currency daily versus a mark/dollar basket.
""I said that we will try to keep the rate within the plus/minus 7.5 percent band (against the mark/dollar cross rate),"" Tosovsky told reporters.
""I dismissed speculation that we would want to move the crown in some way outside the band,"" he added.
Analysts recently have been debating whether a devaluation of the crown might be needed to boost exports and help stem a ballooning current account deficit.
The trade deficit is threatening to send the current account shortfall to close to six percent of gross domestic product this year after about four percent last year.
Some have argued that a devaluation is required to help the country's goods remain competitive while wages are rising and the economy is transforming.
But others have said that the foreign capital inflow is l comfortably paying for the imports, and the current account deficit is not dangerous.
Tosovsky said a stable crown had served its purpose in regulating inflation, and a stronger crown would have positive effects on reforming Czech industry to make it more competitive.
He said a stronger crown ""should help faster restructuring of our economy, to help increase the added-value faster...and to help to bring our country closer in productivity to the countries that we want to compare ourselves with.""
The central bank fixes the crown daily within a band plus or minus 7.5 percent from the central parity of the mark/crown basket.
It has been fixing it recently at more than three percent above parity to match a modest net inflow from foreign crown buying.
After the meeting, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said the government would aim to provide more funds to export promotion agencies such as the Czech Export Bank, and its sister export insurance agency.
He said he had told business leaders it was necessary to lower their expectations of higher inflation because it had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
""We cannot automatically appease the expectation of, let's say, nine percent inflation, and make that the basis for all further expenditure -- price and wage items,"" Klaus said.
He said this would be key to the government's position in collective bargaining. ""We have to radically break this (inflation expectation). This must be the basis of this year's debates on collective agreements.""",0
"The largest Czech commercial bank, Komercni Banka a.s., said on Friday that profits in the first nine months of this year fell some 10 percent due to accounting changes. The shares rose on the news.
The bank's net profit, calculated under international accounting standards, declined to 4.88 billion crowns from 5.44 billion, but Komercni shares moved higher on the Prague Stock Exchange as analysts praised the results.
The bank's finance division director Kamil Ziegler told a news conference that since third quarter 1995, Komercni had revised its accounting method to exclude unpaid late fees and commissions.
""Our profit, according to international accounting standards, is roughly 10 percent lower than in the same period of the last year. But there are very important methodological influences,"" Ziegler told reporters.
Only those fees that have actually been paid are included in the figures now whereas outstanding receivables were included previously, he said.
He added that the amount of late fees that would have been included under the previous accounting method was 1.2 billion crowns. Komercni posted a 5.11 billion net profit for the whole of 1995.
The bank's total assets rose to 432.04 billion crowns at the end of the third quarter from 336.21 billion, year-on-year.
The net interest margin declined to 4.07 percent from 5.40 percent, but up from 3.93 percent at the end of the first half.
Under Czech accounting standards, which Ziegler said do not include the tital of 700 million crowns of unrealised gains from securities, Komercni's gross profit for the period was 3.87 billion, down from 6.83 billion year on year.
He told rpeorters that he considered the results to be ""very good"", but warned that simple annualisation of the nine month figures would not lead to a full-year profit forecast.
He said fourth quarter results could be affected by unclear development on the stock market and other factors.
Sandy Winthrop Chen, vice president of equity research at the Prague office of CS First Boston, welcomed the figures,
""The results are quite in line with our expectations, I think the performance is very strong, and it puts Komercni Banka in a very good position to meet or exceed out 1996 forecast.""
He added that the forecast was a 5.95 billion crown net profit, according to international standards.
Komercni share price jumped 125 crowns on the Prague Stock Exchange soon after the news to 2,125, and closed at 2,126 after a week of heavy losses in which some analysts anticipated poor results.
Dealer Karel Ruzicka of ING Barings said the results were in line with his expectations and partly attributed Komercni's share price rise to demand from foreign investors.
""Some of the foreign investors...think they are not so bad therefore we can see some demand in the stock,"" he said.
Added Chen: ""We definitely remain buyers of the stock, and the recent weakeness in the shareprice we interpret as a major buyer opportunity.""
Komercni's largest shareholder is still the Czech government which has a 48.74 percent stake, followed by the Bank of New York which has accumlated a 9.65 percent stake.",0
"Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus accused opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman of lying and losing his nerve as neck-and-neck campaigning for weekend Senate elections turned increasingly bitter.
Zeman made a thinly-veiled allegation that the BIS intelligence agency had tried to extract compromising material from his elderly mother.
The slanging match between the two leading antagonists of Czech politics began on Monday when BIS director Stanislav Devaty, a Klaus protege, was forced to quit over allegations of spying on a deputy prime minister and a subsequent coverup.
""Yesterday's comments by Zeman on a police state, or on the BIS as a political police in the service of one party, are a visible result of losing his nerve before the elections,"" Klaus told a news conference.
""I can imagine such words being said by a radical anarchist but I can't imagine them from one of the three highest constitutional officials of this country.""
On Monday Zeman, who is lower house speaker, accused Klaus of playing dirty before the Senate elections, where the Social Democrats have been running level with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
""The political struggle should be a struggle of arguments and not an abuse of secret services for spying on political opponents,"" he said.
""During the last three years an operational group has existed within the BIS which has been responsible for shadowing several Social Democrat politicians,"" said Zeman.
Spymaster Devaty quit after Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the junior Christian Democrats in Klaus's coalition, accused the BIS of spying on him three years ago.
The BIS had covered up the operation by failing to report it to the cabinet and a parliamentary commission supervising the agency.
Klaus said the agent had been spying not on Lux, who is also agriculture minister, but on a former adviser of his who was director of a bank which collapsed amidst fraud allegations in 1993. He has not explained why the state security service was investigating an apparent fraud case.
Devaty was a member of Klaus's ODS, although he had suspended his membership to become BIS chief.
Allegations of politically-inspired spying on both government and opposition politicians have surfaced regularly in recent years in a country where memories remain of the pervasive state security apparatus before communism fell in 1989.
The political temperature soared on Tuesday when Zeman said his 79-year-old mother had been visited by ""certain people"" trying to acquire compromising information.
Asked about this comment, Klaus said: ""If this actually represents what he said then this is such an unbelievable lie that I couldn't bring myself to reply at all. It's pure lie.""
Klaus accused Zeman of running a negative campaign.
""Instead of programmes there are scandals and affairs which destabilise the state and damage our country abroad,"" he said.
""The BIS affair is a clear evidence that above all the (Social Democrats) lack, in contrast to the ODS, a positive programme.""",0
"Bidders for a stake in troubled Czech aircraft maker Aero Vodochody a.s. must offer at least 950 million Czech crowns ($35 million) for the shares, Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on Thursday.
But he told a news conference that the tender, open to domestic and foreign bidders seeking to revitalise the light jet maker, might be geared toward choosing a Czech partner.
Between 34 and 40 percent of Aero will be sold, depending on how many new shares are issued during the deal, rules for which the cabinet approved on Wednesday.
Dlouhy said a steering committee would evaluate bids in the tender, which is expected to open by the end of the month, based on bidders' economic strength, obligations to other shareholders and their strategic position.
The Czech chemical and arms conglomerate Chemapol Group a.s. has shown an interest in Aero, as well as local trading company CIMEX Holding a.s., and Boeing Co of the United States in an alliance with Czech airline Ceske Aerolinie a.s..
Dlouhy said Aero shareholders controlled by the state would pass their shareholders' rights to the new investor to allow it to manage the company from a majority position.
The winner of the tender, ultimately picked by the cabinet, should be known in April.
Dlouhy said strategic considerations might persuade the steering committee to pick a Czech domestic partner for Aero.
""If, for example, the Defence Ministry submits arguments which persuade the commission that it is necessary... to prefer a domestic investor, it will be a criterion ... followed by the commission.
""But we do not want to consider it open only for domestic companies from the beginning,"" he said.
Shareholders of the debt-strapped company approved a cut in Aero's basic capital last month to one million crowns from 962 million, as part of an overall a financial restructuring plan. They also agreed to underwrite a rights issue to raise equity to between 1.74 and 2.5 billion crowns as a part of the deal.
Aero is pinning hopes of recovering from financial problems on its flagship L-159, a light training subsonic fighter currently in its final stages of development, which is to be equipped with Rockwell International Corp avionics.
The Czech army has signed up to buy 72 L-159s, and the government has already approved a 3.26 billion crown package clearing the heavily indebted company's books.
Other criteria approved by the cabinet include that Aero will not pay out dividends until production of L-159 starts, and that the investor has to pay most of the price of the shares from his own assets, not on credit.",0
"The Czech Statistical Bureau
(CSU) said on Thursday it would change its methodology for
calculating industrial production, to bring it in line with
western standards.
CSU Chairman Edvard Outrata said the change, which updates
the old methodology introduced in 1953 under communist
planning, would take effect in January 1997.
The new methodology excludes multiple calculation of
semi-finished products, resources, and other materials and
commodities, which were included in output data at every stage
under the old method measuring the gross value of all goods
produced, the CSU said.
The new index will measure output changes by units, weight
or other measurements, of the total of 1,304 products out of
879 product groups consisting of one or more similar products.
The product groups's output indices will be placed in
sectors, using weighting equal to their weight in the
respective industrial sector.
The overall index will be calculated from weighted changes
in the sectoral indices.
Outrata said the old system of measuring ""gross
production"", or ""goods production"" was suited for the
management of a planned economy as it allowed to measure the
total summ of production and compare it with state plans.
Construction output data will be adjusted to the new
methodology at the beginning of 1998, Outrata added.
Preliminary monthly data will be released on the 40th day
after the end of the month being examined.
Outrata also said the data would include seasonally
adjusted and figures adjusted if the number of working days in
the period differed from previously measured periods.
He added the CSU would gradually, throughout next year,
start releasing seasonally adjusted and pro-rated figures for
most data on the same day as the raw figures.

"The Czech Republic could have a 50,000- 100,000 tonne sugar surplus from this year's campaign but little will be exported due to high local production costs and a world sugar surplus, sugar experts say.
The Agriculture Ministry said the state would buy some surplus sugar for strategic reserves and would prepare indirect support for exporters but it ruled out direct export subsidies.
Industry sources varied in their assesment of potential foreign markets but agreed producers will try to sell as much as they can at home as world prices were considerably lower.
""It is expected that the surplus will be up to 80,000 to 100,000 tonnes,"" said Eva Divisova of the ministry, adding that total production will be between 520,000 and 540,000 tonnes raw value after last campaign's 460,035 tonnes.
She added net sugar exports should be about 4,000 tonnes. Divisova declined to say how much the state would buy for its reserves, nor what the reserves are, saying this was secret.
""State reserves will be filled, other parts will have to be exported. But it is very difficult to get to foreign markets,"" Divisova added.
She said Slovakia was not importing due to higher output. There are payment problems with Ukraine and Russia, but former Yugoslav countries were potentially interesting, she said.
Director of trading firm Agrointernational Petr Prochazka believed the surplus would total 50,000-80,000 tonnes, most of which would stay in the Czech Republic.
""The surplus will not be so dramatic...There are quite good yields but the harvest is going slowly due to bad weather. A forecast freeze and subsequent warming will limit output.""
""Producers will not want to export...(because of low prices) Those who can store it, will, he told Reuters, adding he believed the state could buy up to 20,000 tonnes for reserves.
Secretary of the Sugar Refiners' Association Vladimir Ulrich also saw a 50,000-80,000-tonne surplus but said it could be partially swallowed by the state and the elasticity of domestic consumption. But he stressed that financial costs of storing sugar could push producers to sell at any price.
Ulrich said local prices have dropped to 12-15 crowns per kilo from 16 earlier in the year. The market is protected by a 68.4 percent tariff, which will drop next year to 65 percent.
""We are pushed from two sides -- the domestic surplus and low price on the world market. If prices drop further, other sugar could get here,"" Ulrich told Reuters.
Breweries could buy up to 10,000 tonnes more than they usually do if prices go below the costs of malt, and citric acid makers could take care of another 10,000 tonnes, Ulrich said.
""There is a hunger for sugar in Bulgaria, Romaina, Ukraine, also in Russia,"" said Ulrich. He added that Poland, which itself expects to have a sizeable surplus, was also a potential market.
""We also cannot expect to supply the London exchange, because our sugar does not meet the conditions,"" he noted.
He said Cezch exporters could also look to traditional markts like Saudi Arabia...""Of course, the price would be poor.""
The ministry and Ulrich said the surplus would lead to a smaller sown area next year after 104,115 hectares this year. ""I believe the optimal area for next few years would be between 90,000 and 94,000 hectares,"" Ulrich said.",0
"The party of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus performed strongly in Senate elections on Saturday but with turnout at 35 percent, the real winner was apathy.
In what was billed as a key test of the minority coalition government, Klaus's centre-right Civic Democratic Party (ODS) took a commanding 36.47 percent of the first round vote, with the opposition Social Democrats trailing on 20.27 percent.
The result was a major improvement for the ODS, which won only 29.6 percent in elections to the lower house in June when a strong Social Democrat performance of 26.4 percent stripped Klaus's three-party coalition of its majority.
Klaus, the father of Czech economic reform, played down the voter apathy and played up the ODS performance.
""It is obvious that the citizens of this country understand that they want stability,"" he told reporters, alluding to the political stalemate since the inconclusive lower house polls.
""These elections ... are an important test of the political feelings of people of this country about the (June) elections. In this respect they are giving an important signal,"" he said.
Klaus also sidestepped questions on whether he might seek early lower house elections to try to regain his majority.
But analysts said the results may be misleading. Unlike the lower house system of proportional representation, the Senate is elected in two rounds of a first-past-the-post system.
Only three ODS candidates won outright in the first round held on Friday and Saturday. Another 76 face a run-off on November 22-23 between the top two contenders in constitiuencies where no-one won more than half the first round vote.
Also, the well-organised and funded ODS is better at rallying support when public interest in elections is low than the Social Democrats. Klaus cannot therefore automatically rely on repeating the performance in a lower house election, when turnout is usually over 75 percent.
But the dismal turnout vindicated more the far-right Republicans, who boycotted the elections to the newly-created upper house and told fellow Czechs to do likewise.
The Central Election Commission said turnout was just 35.03 percent, far lower than forecast and compared with 76.4 percent participation in lower house elections in June.
Zeman, whose party has been afflicted by squabbling, appeared to blame the low turnout for the poor result.
But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates.""
In the end the Republicans led by doctor of philosophy Miroslav Sladek came out looking best without even running.
Sladek hit a chord by denouncing the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent rally.
Polls showed few Czechs understand the function of the Senate, which has little power compared with the lower Chamber of Deputies. With a few exceptions, most of the candidates are little known because Czech leaders all sit in the lower house.",0
"Disgruntled Czech opposition Social Democrats have blamed party chairman Milos Zeman for their poor showing in weekend elections for the country's new Senate.
They suggested that charges by Zeman ahead of the elections that intelligence agents had harassed himself and his mother had backfired on the party, which had been neck and neck with the ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in most opinion polls.
In the event, the Social democrats won only 20.3 percent of the vote in first round voting held on Friday and Saturday. This compared with 36.5 percent for the ODS, led by conservative Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
While the ODS called a news conference on Monday to trumpet its dominant showing, leading Social Democrats went to ground after a weekend of squabbling over who was to blame.
Vasil Biben, Social Democrat candidate in the north Bohemian town of Trutnov, was blunt in his criticism of Zeman.
""The Social Democrats were were hurt by his pre-election excesses, thanks to which the party lost centre-left voters,"" the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Biben, who will fight a second round run-off this weekend, as saying.
Shortly before the polls Zeman alleged secret agents had tried to extract compromising information from his elderly mother.
Earlier he had caused uproar when he accused the state intelligence agency BIS of spying on him. But he failed to provide evidence to a parliamentary watchdog and earned a rebuke from President Vaclav Havel.
The Social Democrats divided roughly into those who back Zeman and those who support four rebel deputies who voted with Klaus's coalition in a parliamentary budget vote last month.
Low turnout also hit the centre-left party, which did so well in general parliamentary six months ago that Klaus's centre-right coalition lost its parliamentary majority.
Only 34 percent of the electorate bothered to vote for the newly-created Senate (upper house), which few Czechs seem to understand. But the pro-business ODS proved much better at getting its supporters out than the opposition.
The Social Democrats failed to win most votes in any constituency, although their candidates went through to the second round in 48 of the 81 constituencies by finishing second.
Afterwards Zeman blamed the rebels, who included one of his vice-chairmen, Karel Machovec, for the setback. The defection in early October triggered public squabbling between the party's right wing and former communist colleagues.
Zeman dismissed the row over the BIS as a factor, citing a poll taken before the spy scandal broke which showed a sharp drop in the willingness of Czechs to vote again so soon after general elections.
""When I analyse what happened, and see that this opinion poll preceded the BIS affair, then I can find only one cause and that is the budget vote,"" he said.
One Social democrat rebel, Jozef Wagner, described this as nonsense.
Wagner, who chairs the parliamentary budget committee, noted that the BIS affair had been broken not by Zeman but by Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, who leads the Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's coalition.
Wagner said the Social Democrats should have stayed quiet in the affair, which cost the job of the BIS acting director.",0
"Czech surgeons began exploratory surgery on President Vaclav Havel on Monday to remove a spot from his lung, but the former dissident playwright has said that his health was not in serious danger.
Havel's office announced in a statement that a news briefing would be held on Monday afternoon after the operation but an official said it was impossible to say how the long the surgery would last.
Havel, a heavy smoker who spent almost five years in communist jails, has been ill for several weeks.
But in his weekly radio address, broadcast on Sunday, he was in an optimistic mood, saying the operation would ""remove some sort of bad point or spot found on my lungs, the character of which is still unknown"".
""However, even if it is something bad, it is so small and its location is so favourable that it seems that I am in no serious danger,"" he said in the address, recorded on Friday.
Havel, who led the 1989 ""Velvet Revolution"" which overthrew communism, said in the address from his hospital bed: ""I am here not because my state of health is worsening"".
""On the contrary, never in the past few weeks have I felt as well as I feel just now.""
Havel, who is widely respected at home and abroad, was admitted to hospital last Monday, more than a week after his office said he was suffering from pneumonia. Later surgeons described the planned surgery as ""medium serious"".
The Czech daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that a sample of the spot would be sent for immediate analysis during the operation. Based on the results, surgeons would decide whether to continue with the operation, it said without elaborating.
Havel will keep his full presidential responsibilities during the operation.
Under the Czech constitution, most executive power lies with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus who is attending the European security summit in Lisbon in Havel's place.
Havel's power lies more in his personal authority and reputation for honesty in a Czech political scene increasingly dominated by squabbling and allegations of impropriety.
Opinion polls show his popularity rating at around 80 percent while public disillusionment with Czech politics is widespread.
Turnout for elections to the new Senate last month was just 30 percent in the second round, and a poll published last week showed that 58 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the state of Czech politics.
Havel, whose wife Olga died of cancer in January, supports the free market but has bitterly criticised the corruption, dishonesty and materialism which has accompanied the scramble to make money.",0
"Outboard Marine Corp said it is only five percent finished with a radical restructuring that it expects will result in more charges against earnings in 1997 and possibly in 1998, the company said.
Restructuring is about ""five percent complete as far as going down the road and getting the savings,"" said spokesman Stan Main. ""That does not mean that we've taken only five percent of our restructuring charges ... There will likely be more charges during '97 and perhaps even into '98.""
Shares in Outboard on Friday were off 1/4 to 15-3/4.  
The Waukegan, Ill.-based maker of boats and boat engines reported fourth-quarter profits Thursday that, excluding restructuring charges, beat Wall Street estimates.
Analysts cautioned, however, that a turnaround at Outboard remains a long-term project.
""They're going to be continuing this restructuring process in '97 and they're going to continue to have some more charges ... They describe the phase they're in now as the discovery process,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Harriet Baldwin.
A key moment could come Tuesday when Outboard executives are scheduled to meet with analysts and investors in New York.  
Expected to be in attendance are the principals of Greenway Partners, an investment firm led by former Carl Icahn associates Alfred Kingsley and Gary Duberstein. Greenway bought an 8.5-percent stake in Outboard this summer.
Although the firm is known for activism, Greenway so far has not pressured Outboard to alter course, Main said. Nor has there been further communication between Greenway and company executives since initial discussions in August, he said.
Analysts speculated there could be fireworks next week or at the January 16 annual meeting of shareholders, who are said to be growing impatient for a cohesive recovery plan.  
A restructuring was set in motion this year by chief executive Harry Bowman, who came aboard in 1995, when the stock was trading in the low 20s. Bowman continues to deliberate over how to fix Outboard and key pieces remain to be put in place, analysts said.
The business is under evaluation from top to bottom, Main said. Once restructuring is complete, Outboard ""certainly will be a marine products company,"" he said.  
""Longer term, we could get into products that would not be marine related. But our initial focus over the next two to three years is to fix the business that we're in and then perhaps look at other areas that might be less cyclical or seasonal,"" said Main, who is director of strategic planning.
Bowman has spoken of finding more stability for Outboard, which suffers more from boating's boom-bust cycles than rivals, such as Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp, which has diversified into bowling, fishing and camping gear.
Outboard sees opportunities to enter other markets -- such as motorcycles, snowmobiles and personal watercraft -- via its innovative FICHT fuel injection engine technology, Main said.
Spending on capital and tooling in fiscal 1996, ended September 30, fell to $52.7 million from $66.5 million the year before, but spending on FICHT is holding steady as the company converts more of its engine line to it, he said.
Sales of 150-hp FICHT engines to dealers will begin in December and consumers will see the engines in January. A promotional roll-out is underway.
The company plans to convert its entire outboard engine line above 20-hp to FICHT engines, which will cost 22 to 25 percent more than their traditional equivalents, Main said.",0
"General Instrument Corp. said Tuesday it planned to split into three companies through a tax-free spin-off to shareholders in a bid to boost its stock market value.
Wall Street welcomed the move, which was seen as unlocking the value of the Chicago-based company's core high-tech communications business.
""That's where the growth is,"" said industry analyst Louis Ehrenkrantz of brokerage Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
General Instrument said it will create NextLevel Systems Inc. out of its cable television, satellite and telephone business; CommScope Inc. out of its coaxial cable manufacturing business; and General Semiconductor Inc. from its units that make electronic components.
""Investors will be able to value each of the three companies on its own merits and growth fundamentals,"" said General Instrument Chairman Richard Friedland.
The company said the breakup will force it to take an after-tax charge against earnings of $55 million to $65 million, or 37 cents to 44 cents a share, for the fourth quarter. The fourth-quarter charges consist mainly of costs related to the transition to the next generation of digital products, restructuring costs incurred through Dec. 31, and the write-down of certain assets, the company said.
The company said it will incur additional charges this year of up to $70 million for costs related to the spin-off, including the costs of dividing the company's Taiwan assets between NextLevel Systems and General Semiconductor.
The company expects fourth-quarter earnings, which will be announced Feb. 10, to be in the range of 28 cents to 32 cents a share, excluding the charges. Last year, the company reported net earnings of $53.5 million, or 43 cents per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter.
The restructuring is expected to be completed this summer.
Friedland, who will become chairman of NextLevel, said the three businesses would be best positioned as independent, public companies.
""The businesses have different dynamics and business cycles, serve different markets and customers, are subject to different competitive forces and must be managed with different short- and long-term goals,"" Friedland said in a statement.
NextLevel will be comprised of General Instrument's cable, satellite and telephone businesses, which had 1996 sales of about $1.7 billion. The company will supply systems and components for high-performance networks delivering video, voice and Internet and data services.
CommScope Inc. will make and supply coaxial and electronic cables, businesses that had 1996 sales of more than $560 million.
General Semiconductor Inc., the company's power semiconductor division, will supply low-to-medium power rectifiers and voltage suppressors. It had 1996 sales of more than $360 million.
General Instrument stock rose 12.5 cents to $22.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Shareholders are pushing harder for change at WMX Technologies Inc, which said Monday a major investor is proposing that the company hire investment bankers to examine further sales of non-core assets.
Lens Inc, based in Washington, D.C., also has hired an executive recruiter to assemble an alternate slate of nominees for four WMX board seats coming open this year, including WMX chairman Dean Buntrock's seat,  said a Lens spokeswoman.
""The battle lines are being drawn here,"" said Goldman Sachs industry analyst Barry Mannis.  
WMX, the largest U.S. garbage hauler with $10 billion in annual revenues, has been under investor attack for months. Not only Lens, headed by Robert Monks, but billionaire George Soros and others are among WMX shareholders demanding changes.
The company has responded by repurchasing shares and selling off pieces of its Rust International unit, its stake in Wessex Water Plc and most of its medical waste business. The sales have raised about $1 billion in cash.
Yet WMX's stock price has hardly budged, prompting the activist stakeholders to press harder still for management changes, new directors and more asset sales, analysts said.  
""Management has been moving in this direction and the stock price has responded moderately, but I don't think to anywhere near the level that investors want,"" Mannis said.
Shares in WMX were off 1/4 at 33-1/2 late Monday, compared to a 24-month high above $36 in early December. A year ago, they were trading in the $30 per share range.
""Between now and the annual meeting (May 9), management has its opportunity to once and for all...show the Street its plan for enhancing shareholder value. If they don't do that, I think investors are going to look at some of the proposals Lens is making,"" Mannis said.  
Soros Fund Management owns 19.7 million shares of WMX, or nearly four percent of the company, according to CDA/Spectrum.
Lens's stake is reportedly much smaller than Soros's.
The latest proposal from Lens on selling non-core assets contains little new, WMX spokesman Bill Plunkett said.
""The proposal is consistent with the things the company is already aggressively pursuing, essentially affirming our strategy,"" Plunkett said. ""We have other equity investments remaining. We have other businesses that are non-core and we have under-performing businesses.... We have been working with various financial advisers to enhance shareholder value.""
Credit Suisse First Boston industry analyst Michael Hoffman said WMX on its own will likely fulfill Soros's and Lens's agenda. ""These guys would just like it to happen faster,"" Hoffman said. WMX has ""done a lot of the easier things. Now it gets a little more challenging.""
An obvious next step for the company would be to authorize more share buybacks, Mannis said.
WMX could still sell off certain non-U.S. interests, as well as its equity interest in ServiceMaster LP, analysts said. Whether such steps are taken before the annual meeting remains to be seen, but in the meantime, Lens and Soros can be expected to keep the pressure on.
""This is just another volley in the skirmish,"" said Smith Barney industry analyst Leone Young.
WMX is scheduled to report fourth-quarter financial results in the week of February 3.",0
"Increasing pressure from customers to hold down prices will keep a profit squeeze on U.S. medical device manufacturers in 1997, although the sector's biggest firms are expected to show healthy growth.
Other variables looming over the industry are the naming of a successor to departing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler and Congress' mood on healthcare.
""Expectations are still for a positive environment from a Washington standpoint, but I don't think you can take that for granted,"" said Prudential Securities analyst Charlene Lu.  
After six contentious years, Kessler announced his resignation from the FDA last month. The White House has not named a replacement. ""Questions like who replaces Kessler are going to have a big impact on whether new products get approved quickly,"" Lu said.
Congressional and White House sentiment on reforming the U.S. healthcare industry is lukewarm at the moment, but could reemerge as an issue, analysts said.
""Meanwhile, managed care marches on and that will have an impact,"" said Wasserstein Perella analyst Robert Dunne.  
Health maintenance organizations, hospitals and others that buy medical devices -- such as pacemakers, catheters and heart valves -- are squeezing device makers for lower prices. That has cut into profits and limited the growth potential of some companies, analysts said.
""You're going to continue to see greater and greater market pressures,"" Lu said.
In search of growth, many device companies are looking overseas and finding opportunity. ""To grow the top line, you've got to move outside the United States,"" said Dain Bosworth analyst Rachael Scherer.  
Partly as a result, the sector's biggest firms -- those with global reach -- had the best 1996 and are widely expected to lead the pack again next year. Companies such as Medtronic Inc, Boston Scientific Corp and Guidant Corp are widely seen as market outperformers for 1997.
""I'm looking probably for 20 percent-plus earnings growth from them ... Those stocks will probably perform a little bit better than the market,"" Dunne said.  
Possibly less rosy is the general outlook for small device companies. Scherer pointed out that Nasdaq medical technology stocks severely underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index this year, while larger listed issues topped the index, mirroring a dichotomy seen in other industries, as well.
""We're optimistic that Nasdaq med tech issues will outperform next year,"" Scherer said.
Smaller and mid-sized firms named by analysts as potential 1997 winners were Datascope Corp, Target Therapeutics Inc, Stryker Corp, Mentor Corp, and Nellcor Puritan Bennett Inc.
On the technology front, growth was expected to continue to be strong for stents, which shore up the insides of diseased blood vessels, and implantable defibrillators, which treat too-rapid heartbeat.
Key products expected next year from industry giant Medtronic include an atrial fibrillation device, a device for continually recording electrocardiogram readouts to help diagnose unexpected fainting, a new stent and an implantable drug pump for cancer patients, Medtronic said.",0
"Eight of the top 10 publicly traded U.S. health maintenance organizations are expected to report lower or flat fourth-quarter profits as the industry shuts the books on a dismal year and moves warily into 1997.
Dissatisfied with narrow profit margins, Wall Street is turning cautious on many HMO stocks, although plenty of merger and acquisition action underlies the sector and is supporting the share prices of firms seen as targets.
""Consolidation will remain at a high level,"" said Salomon Brothers managed healthcare analyst Robert Hoehn.  
As HMOs report quarterly results over the next few weeks, two companies are expected to defy the earnings slump.
Booming Oxford Health Plans Inc has been a bright spot in the gloom all year and is forecast to post profits 70 percent higher than the year-ago level, analysts said.
PacifiCare Health Systems Inc is expected to show 10 to 13 percent earnings improvement, although its quarter will be complicated by a pending acquisition of FHP International Corp.
""It's sort of a throw-away quarter for"" PacifiCare, said Volpe Welty analyst Ed Keaney.  
The problem that most HMOs were unable to solve throughout 1996 was a costly mismatch between medical cost inflation forecasts that fell short and an inability to push through compensatory premium increases. A margin squeeze resulted.
""This year there may be room for a little bit of (premium) expansion as the year unfolds, but not enough of an increase to make it possible for these companies to restore margins to previous levels,"" Keaney said.
Citing small premium rises so far in the January renewal period, Hoehn said: ""Uncertainties regarding profitability will remain, albeit at a reduced level from 1996.""

"Freed from its slow-growing data storage and imaging businesses, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. Friday reported a 16 percent jump in earnings for the third quarter.
The St. Paul, Minn.-based manufacturing giant -- sometimes seen as a mirror of the U.S. economy -- said net profits rose to $398 million, or 95 cents a share, in the quarter, from $344 million, or 82 cents a share, in the 1995 period. The year-ago quarter included earnings of $5 million, or 1 cent a share, from discontined operations.
Sales grew 7 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.37 billion.
The results surpassed analysts' average forecasts of 93 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
3M's stock jumped $2 to $73.25, helping to boost the Dow Jones industrial average, of which is it is a component.
""It's been a long time since 3M beat any kind of estimate,"" said PNC Institutional Investment Services analyst John Franck. ""A lot of people were questioning whether this company could grow again.""
3M served notice that it can grow with third-quarter sales up 7.5 percent and profits up 17.4 percent, analysts said.
""Now that they've spun off Imation, which was taking up too much of their resources and adding to earnings volatility, this is the 3M that most people expect when they invest in it,"" said Crowell Weedon analyst Douglas Christopher.
On July 1, 3M's data storage and imaging businesses began operations as an independent company, Imation Corp. The third quarter was 3M's first since the spinoff.
""They're not held back anymore by that business that's now called Imation,"" said Merrill Lynch analyst Robert Curran.
3M said it expected solid growth again in the fourth quarter.
If it can deliver successive quarters of big gains, the company's stock could move out of the realm of value stock funds and draw the attention again of growth stock investors, analysts said.
""3M is a little different from most companies ... They're PhD oriented so there's a lot of intellectual types up there, but they're building a powerhouse,"" said Franck.
3M makes thousands of products -- from Scotch tape, Post-it notes and air filters to diaper closures, flexible computer circuits and kitchen sponges.
""It can be said that their domestic business is something of an indicator of the economy as a whole because it's so diverse,"" said Merrill Lynch's Curran.
That portrayal is somewhat less accurate since the Imation spin-off, since key sectors of the economy are now absent from 3M's product line and more than half its business is outside the United States.
Still, said Franck, ""You can probably take U.S. GDP (gross domestic product), multiply it by two and factor in whatever you want for inflation and you've basically got their sales growth rate ... If the economy is doing well, they do well.""
The company's units in Japan, elsewhere in Asia, Latin America and Canada posted double-digit volume increases in the quarter while unit sales in Europe grew 7 percent, despite sluggish economies in many major European countries.
For the nine months, net income grew 6 percent to $1.14 billion, or $2.73 a share, as sales rose 4 percent to $10.61 billion.",0
"After a tough year of slimmer profits and lower stock values, U.S. health maintenance organisations are expected to bounce back a bit in 1997.
Medical cost inflation is slowing and analysts see room for HMOs to raise premiums and restore some of the profit margin they lost this year. Still, the prognosis is cautious as the industry continues consolidating and faces controversy.
""It's not a super spectacular outlook, but it certainly looks better than 1995 and 1996,"" said Bear Stearns managed health care industry analyst Gary Frazier.
This year, medical costs, driven largely by higher prescription drug prices, rose faster than forecasts based on historical trends and left HMOs locked into premium rates that were too low to preserve profit margins. By early spring, the pinch was evident to Wall Street and HMO stock values from March to July declined sharply across the board.
Thirteen of the 16 largest publicly traded HMOs still have not regained first-quarter highs since the sell-off. The three that have are United Wisconsin Services Inc., Oxford Health Plans Inc. and FHP International Corp., which is being acquired by PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.
Good recovery has been experienced by PacifiCare, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Aetna Inc., while only modest upward reversals have been made by industry giant United Healthcare Corp., Humana Inc. and others. Still reeling from the debacle are Coventry Corp., Mid Atlantic Medical Services Inc. and Physician Corp.
""Questions about pricing and margins still hang over the industry,"" said Salomon Brothers managed health care industry analyst Robert Hoehn.
Medical cost inflation forecasts vary, but most analysts look for premiums to rise slightly faster than costs in 1997.
""The HMOs are starting to take some action by raising premiums, but the problem is they're really just catching up,"" said Peter Reilly, an actuary at the health care consulting firm of Milliman & Robertson. ""Premium increases have lagged cost increases significantly.""
Whether HMOs are able next year to restore profit margins to the levels that Wall Street likes may have as much to do with their willingness to court public criticism as with their actual market power, suggested one industry observer.
""This has been a year characterised by scathing attacks on the industry with the implication that profits are being made at the expense of high-quality health care,"" said Doug Sherlock, editor of the industry newsletter Pulse.
With one eye on public relations and the other on the bottom line, some HMOs in 1996 may have intentionally let margins slip, Sherlock suggested. ""One or 2 percent profit margins are less easy to attack than 9 percent,"" he said.
If the heat in state legislatures and elsewhere subsides, HMOs may feel they have room to move, or they may not, Sherlock said. ""These companies still have ... all the bargaining power they need. It's really a situation of whether they choose to exercise it or not.""
Based on a survey of 100 HMOs nationwide, Pulse projects the industry's aggregate medical-loss ratio to decline 1.5 percentage points next year, boosting profits slightly. The ratio, which measures how much HMOs pay out to cover members' medical costs, rose a hefty 4.2 percentage points in 1996.
More mergers and acquisitions are expected, as well. Of the more than 600 U.S. HMOs, only United and Aetna look to be truly national players, Hoehn said. ""Everybody else has to either merge with someone or sell,"" he said.",0
"Monsanto Co. said on Monday it will spin off its chemicals business in a long-awaited and costly move that will allow the company to focus on its faster-growing agriculture, food and healthcare units.
Between 1,500 and 2,500 jobs will be eliminated in the transaction, causing the company to take a $400 million to $600 million fourth-quarter charge against earnings, it said.
""What they're trying to create is one company that's clearly focused on growth and one that's clearly focused on efficiency,"" said Smith Barney industry analyst James Wilbur.
St. Louis, Mo.-based Monsanto is a far-flung conglomerate whose varied products include Roundup weed killer, NutraSweet sweetener, carpet fibers, and drugs for treating arthritis and insomnia, as well as genetically engineered corn and soybeans.
Wall Street had long expected the giant company, which has about $8.9 billion in annual sales, to break itself up.
""It was a fait accompli,"" Wilbur said. ""The market likes companies that are less diversifed.""
The pared-down Monsanto will focus on its higher-profit margin agricultural, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology businesses, a spokesman said.
The new chemicals business will have to emphasize production efficiencies in a market subject to cyclical sales trends and intense global competition, analysts said.
""After careful consideration, we're convinced these businesses must operate separately to reach their maximum potential and thereby unlock significant value in both,"" Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro said.
Shapiro will head the post-spin-off Monsanto and Executive Vice President Robert Potter, who runs the chemicals business, will run the new company, still unnamed, Monsanto said.
The scope of job cuts coming with the spin-off has not been determined, but more details will likely be available by the end of January, a spokesman said.
Monsanto employs 28,500 people around the world. The anticipated cuts would reduce that headcount by 5 percent to 9 percent, the company said.
The tax-free spin-off proposed would create a new firm by the end of 1997. Current Monsanto shareholders would keep their Monsanto shares and get shares in the new concern as a special dividend, the company said.
Monsanto said its directors approved the spin-off.
The company also said the exact amount of the after-tax charge, which is to cover the costs of job reductions, asset and equipment write-offs, and consolidation of some manufacturing and offices, would be fixed at a later date.
Analysts estimated the one-time charge would total between 80 cents and $1 per share.
Monsanto, which reported 1995 profits of $739 million, or $1.25 a share, is expected to post per-share profits for 1996 of $1.50, according to First Call, which tracks analysts' projections.
Monsanto said in October it was considering options for its chemicals business, which had about $3 billion in 1995 revenues but is growing less rapidly than other units and is subject to more ups and downs.
""Chemicals would hurt the multiple of the company if they held onto it ... because the chemicals growth rate is not as high as the agriculturals growth rate and the earnings are more cyclical,"" said PaineWebber industry analyst Paul Raman.
The chemicals business -- making acrylic carpet fibers, plastic interlayers for glass, industrial phosphorus compounds and other products -- was shopped around for months, but no buyer was found, in part for tax reasons, analysts said.
Monsanto said the spin-off requires shareholder approval and clearance by government agencies and the Internal Revenue Service for it to be tax-free.
The spin-off is intended to be completed no later than the end of next year. Until then, the two companies will operate separately within Monsanto beginning early next year, it said.
Monsanto's stock slipped 37.5 cents to $40.75 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Ford Motor Co joined other U.S. automakers Wednesday in their accelerating race to exit the battered car rental business.
Ford said it may sell its interests in Budget Rent a Car, the nation's sixth-largest rental car agency.
If a sale goes through, as analysts widely expect, Budget would be the fifth major agency to change hands since 1994.
""The reason is they're not making any money,"" said WEFA Group automotive consultant George Magliano in New York. ""Travel is hot, but the car rental business is going nowhere.""  
That is not evident from the sudden interest shown in the $14-billion a year business by a new class of investors who are buying up the agencies as the automakers unload them.
""They see opportunity for profits. The industry is in a mild recovery and it's probably a better time to own a rental car agency than it has been for a long time,"" said Jon LeSage, editor of Auto Rental News, a trade journal in California.
Ford declined to comment specifically on a published report that it may sell Budget to Team Rental Group Inc, a Florida-based Budget licensee, for $350 million.
A Team Rental spokesman also declined comment.  
""No agreements have been reached among any parties,"" said Budget spokeswoman Kimberly Mulcahy, declining further comment. She said Ford does not own Lisle, Ill.-based Budget outright, but controls the company through an option to purchase its common shares.
Ford said last year it would exercise its option and buy out Budget's common shares, but analysts said the deal looks shaky now after delays resulting from a U.S. Federal Trade Commission antitrust review.  
As a result, A.G. Edwards auto analyst Michael Braigg in St. Louis said he expects Ford to sell Budget soon, likely to Team Rental. ""I think that one's pretty far along,"" he said.
""The real issue is that Budget is the small rental property of Ford. And if Budget is for sale, then so is Hertz in the long run,"" Braigg said.
Ford began investing in Hertz in 1987 at a time when U.S. automakers were buying up rental car agencies hoping to load up their fleets with the thousands of new cars that consumers were leaving on the lots.  
The strategy worked for a while, but then backfired when agency sales of barely used rental vehicles started eating into new car sales. Automakers began encouraging the agencies to hold onto fleet cars longer, which restricted how many new cars the agencies could take on.
Ford bought all of Hertz in 1994 and, unlike many rental car agencies, Hertz is probably profitable, analysts said.
But Magliano said, ""There is no big advantage to the automakers to owning these agencies anymore ... Probably along the way, Ford will sell Hertz. Generally, when these companies begin to divest operations, they get rid of them all.""  
Reassured by a back-to-basics management trend running through U.S. industry, automakers started selling off rental car agencies in 1994 with Chrysler Corp's sale of Snappy Car Rental.
General Motors Corp in 1995 sold National Car Rental Systems Inc to private investors, who earlier this week resold National to Republic Industries Inc.
Seeking to lock in supply for its fledgling AutoNation used-car chain, Atlanta-based Republic in November agreed to buy Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc.
In June last year, General Motors sold off its 29-percent interest in Avis Inc to HFS Inc, a real estate and hotel concern based in New Jersey.
Chrysler still owns Dollar Rent-A-Car and Thrifty Rent-A-Car. ""Our status today is that Dollar and Thrifty are very much a part of our everyday business. It's business as usual,"" said Chrysler spokeswoman Lori McTavish.
She added, ""It is Chrysler's goal, however, to focus on our core automotive business.""
Based on U.S. vehicle fleet size, Auto Rental News ranks privately held Enterprise Rent-A-Car, of St. Louis, as the largest U.S. rental car agency, followed in order by Hertz, Avis, National, Alamo, Budget, Dollar and Thrifty.
Together, Enterprise, Hertz and Avis own half of the U.S. rental car fleet of about 1.5 million vehicles, according to the trade journal.",0
"Aon Corp. said Wednesday it agreed to acquire Alexander & Alexander Services Inc. for about $1.23 billion, creating by some counts the world's largest insurance and risk consulting company.
Aon, a Chicago-based insurance holding company, said it will pay $17.50 a share, or about $790 million, for Alexander & Alexander's common stock and about $437.5 million to holders of the company's preferred stock.
Layoffs and office closings are expected to follow the deal as Aon moves to cut cost, analysts said.
With offices around the world, Aon employs about 27,000 people; Alexander & Alexander about 12,000.
""You have to assume every place there's an Aon office and an Alex office, one of them has got to close. And that's a lot of places,"" said Conning & Co. insurance analyst Gary Ransom.
Aon Chairman Patrick Ryan said he could not estimate possible job cuts.
""I don't think you should look for huge layoffs,"" he said.
Alexander & Alexander's stock jumped $3.125 to $17.25, while Aon rose $1 to $58.625, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
Alexander & Alexander, based in New York, is the fourth-largest insurance broker in the world. It has operations in 80 countries, primarily the United States, Canada and Britain.
After its acquisition of Alexander & Alexander, Aon will become either the largest or second-largest insurance broker in the world.
How it will size up against rival giant Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. depends on how their operations are counted, Ryan said. ""It's not apples to apples,"" he said.
Aon said it will begin a cash tender offer for Alexander & Alexander's common shares no later than Dec. 16 and upon completion of the tender offer the purchase of the preferred shares will begin.
""Virtually everyone who watches the insurance industry has been expecting this deal,"" said Robinson-Humphrey insurance analyst Thomas Rosencrants.
""It's a fair price. A&A has been struggling for 15 years. There will be tremendous economies of scale to come out of this as A&A is folded into Aon,"" Rosencrants said.
Analysts said they would expect Ryan to head up the combined operations and Alexander & Alexander Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frank Zarb to step aside.
""I would have to assume that Frank Zarb would not be around,"" Ransom said.
The deal was approved unanimously by the boards of both companies, Aon said.
Over the past decade, the insurance industry has become increasingly competitive and insurers have been forced to hold down premium rate increases, which has put downward pressure on their profit margins.
""There's no end in sight to the 10-year soft market,"" Rosencrants said.
Competition has pressured companies to look for strategic alternatives and led to industry consolidation.
Aon in October completed a $250 million acquisition of Bain Hogg Group Inc. from Britain's Inchcape Plc. The Alexander & Alexander deal likely caps Aon's acquisition drive for now, analysts said.
""The industry has been consolidating. Certainly people have been expecting us to continue to be a leader in that,"" Ryan said. ""We've made two what we think to be strategic and good acquisitions. Now we've got to put them together.""
Aon added that its offer was still subject to several conditions, including the tender and non-withdrawal of at least a majority of the voting power of A&A's common shares, and various regulatory approvals.",0
"Pall Corp and Memtec Ltd may have different reasons, but they seem equally determined to acquire Gelman Sciences Inc.
Analysts and arbitrageurs were reluctant to say whether that portends an all-out bidding war, especially after a rally in American Depositary Shares of Memtec on Thursday that reflected some doubt on Wall Street of Memtec's commitment.
Still, Gelman would nicely complement the operations of either suitor and will likely be hotly pursued by both, filtration industry analysts said.  
Shares in Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Gelman closed up 3 at 29 on the American Stock Exchange on the news that it was in discussions with Pall about a possible acquisition.
Gelman reached a definitive agreement on August 30 to be acquired by Australia's Memtec, which said Thursday it intends to proceed with the agreement.
""I don't think Memtec is going to back away,"" said Robert W. Baird & Co analyst Walter Morris.
Memtec wants Gelman's sophisticated membrane technology to put Memtec into closer competition with East Hills, N.Y.-based Pall and Millipore Corp, Morris said. 
Pall -- much larger than either Gelman or Memtec -- wants Gelman to broaden Pall's medical and process businesses and ""frankly, to eliminate a pesky competitor,"" Morris said.
Gelman sales in fiscal 1996 ended July 31 were $112 million, versus $103.5 million in fiscal 1995. Memtec sales in the year ended June 30 were $175 million, up from $145 million in fiscal 1995. Pall had revenues of $960.3 million in fiscal 1996 ended August 3, up from $822.2 million in fiscal 1995.
""Pall under chief executive Eric Krasnoff has been more acquisitive than under previous management teams,"" said Morgan Stanley & Co analyst Mark Gulley.  
""If he does this deal, it will have been his third acquisition"" since taking the helm at Pall about two years ago, Gulley said.
Krasnoff's acquisitions have tended to broaden Pall's presence in existing markets, rather than move it into new areas -- a pattern into which a Gelman acquisition would fit, said Fourteen Research analyst Anthony Ginsberg.
""There's good overlap ... They're in many of the same venues and markets,"" Gulley said.
Morris said, ""Gelman is strategically important to both companies.""
Arbitrageurs seemed to cast doubt Thursday on Memtec's contention that it plans to proceed with the Gelman deal by bidding up the Australian company's American depository shares as much as 3-5/8 in the morning. They lost ground in the afternoon to close up 1-15/16 at 28-15/16.
The rally in part was likely explained by short covering, arbitrageurs said.
Late Thursday, Gelman issued a statement saying it intended to pursue its agreement with Memtec, but also to talk with Pall and any other interested parties.",0
"The Food and Drug Administration is approving new drugs and medical devices at a rapid clip this year, heartening drug and device companies that have long criticised the agency.
In the federal fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the agency cleared for U.S. marketing 46 new drugs, up from 26 approvals in fiscal 1995, the agency said.
In the same period, 37 new medical devices were cleared, up from 27 the year before, according to a tally kept by Montgomery Securities, an investments firm.
""What you are seeing is the culmination of improvements in the review system that date back 10 years or more,"" said FDA associate commissioner for public affairs Jim O'Hara.
Even long-time FDA critic the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PHARMA, sounded congratulatory, albeit with reservations. ""Improvments have been made in the last couple of years,"" said Jeff Trewhitt, PHARMA spokesman.
Two bills before Congress that proposed more flexible and shorter FDA new drug reviews died without action with the adjournment of the House and Senate last week, a sign that the agency's actions have blunted attacks from outside critics.
Drug and medical device industry analysts said faster FDA approvals are helping companies in both sectors by reducing their research and development risks.
A year ago, companies had complained that burdensome U.S. regulatory oversight threatened to drive U.S. drug and medical technology research to Europe, known for speedier reviews.
But a study released this spring showed the FDA's median review time for new drugs approved in 1994 and 1995 was 1.3 years, as fast as that of Britain and faster than those of France, Spain, Germany, Australia, Japan, Italy and Canada, according to the FDA. The study was conducted by the British-based Centre for Medicines Research, the agency said.
""In 1996, the U.S. is reviewing and approving ... faster than any other country,"" O'Hara said.
He credited internal reforms at the FDA largely to passage by Congress in 1992 of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which made more money available to the agency through a system of user fees imposed on companies.
Those revenues have paid for the hiring of more reviewers and upgrading of FDA information systems, he said.",0
"General Instrument Corp is setting goals for NextLevel Systems Inc -- the lead business to come out of a three-way corporate break-up -- of 35-45 percent annual operating income growth and 22-25 percent annual sales growth on operating margins of 10-12 percent.
Those growth rates could be even higher this year, General Instrument chief executive Richard Friedland said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, adding he sees stock price gains ahead for all three firms being formed in the break-up -- NextLevel, CommScope Inc and General Semiconductor Inc.
""I'd look to CommScope and General Semiconductor to increase at above-average rates in the eight to 10 percent return range, maybe more. I see NextLevel Systems doubling over the next year to 18 months,"" Friedland said.
Shares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 22-7/8 Tuesday after the Chicago-based company announced a three-way split designed primarily to unlock the share value of NextLevel.
For CommScope, to be built on the world's largest coaxial cable business, Friedland said management's goals are 18 to 20 percent annual sales growth and 16 to 17 percent operating income growth with operating margins of 16 to 17 percent.
For General Semiconductor, to be formed from General Instrument's electronic component manufacturing operations, goals are 10 to 11 percent operating income growth on annual sales growth of 14-16 percent and operating margins of 20-21 percent, Friedland told analysts at a meeting Tuesday.
Under the plan, General Instrument shareholders will get one share in each of the new companies for each General Instrument share held, Friedland said.
""We may have to do a reverse split to comply with New York Stock Exchange rules,"" he said, adding closing of the transaction is seen by July.
No layoffs or hiring are planned. ""There are no staff actions contemplated as a result of the transaction,"" he said.
General Instrument has primary goals in the restructuring, Friedland said. One is to unlock the value of the businesses that will comprise NextLevel, which analysts said has been held back by General Instrument's other segments.
""Electronic conglomerates are not looked at very favorably these days,"" said Michael Geran, industry analyst at the Pershing Division of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette.
The other goal, Friedland said, has to do with General Instrument's heritage as part of the cable television industry -- a legacy that has overshadowed its newer technologies.
""We're going to continue to service the heck out of the cable base, but we're also getting into provision of dial tone and data. We need to break out of that mold General Instrument has been in of being a cable supplier,"" Friedland said.
He said the company decided to proceed with the break-up because it showed in 1996 that it could meet its business objectives, after failing to do so in years past. ""We've made that transition from development to deployment,"" he said.
Deprived of cash flows thrown off by the CommScope and General Semiconductors businesses, NextLevel will fund growth two ways. ""We do have a lot of visibility to cash flow in NextLevel Systems now that we have the products going out the door,"" he said. ""So we feel that, while NextLevel Systems may be slightly cash negative in '97, even our downside scenarios say we have more than adequate capabilities.""
In addition, he said, most of General Instrument's debt will be loaded onto CommScope and General Semiconductor, which can afford to service it. ""That leaves CommScope and General Semiconductor in fine shape in terms of their capital structure because they do generate the cash to pay this debt off in the near-term,"" he said.",0
"Amoco Corp is basing its 1997 business plans on assumed prices of $18 to $19 per barrel for crude oil and $2.00 to $2.10 per thousand (corrects from million) cubic feet for natural gas, said chief financial officer John Carl.
In an interview with Reuters, Carl said, ""We're making our investment decisions on $18 to $19 crude. On natural gas ... around $2.00, $2.10 per thousand (corrects from million) cubic feet of natural gas is what we're looking at from a planning assumption.""""
U.S. crude futures for March delivery on Wednesday closed at $24.24 per barrel.  
""We like these prices where they are. We think they're where they are because of a tightness between supply and demand ... But we're not making our investment decisions on those prices,"" Carl said.
Shares in Chicago-based Amoco rose 7/8 to 85-7/8 on Wednesday after the energy giant reported strong fourth-quarter and 1996 financial results.
Amoco will likely spend about $550 million this year on exploration, compared to about $610 million in 1996, he said.
The company also is planning to hold its 1997 operating costs throughout the company flat at the 1996 level, he said.  
""You look at total operating costs as a company, they're basically flat, '97 to '96, on a planning basis. We're really pushing that responsibility down into the units. One unit to another unit might have job eliminations ... But we don't anticipate any wholesale, large restructurings like we announced in '92 and '94,"" Carl said.
In reporting results, Amoco said fourth-quarter chemical sector earnings fell versus the year-ago period and cited lower olefins and softened paraxylene product profit margins.
On paraxylene prices, Carl said, ""It looks like maybe they hit the bottom at the end of December"" near $0.19 per pound.  
""It may be that they're starting to firm up a little bit, but I think it's too soon to call that,"" he said.
Paraxylene traded on the spot market Wednesday near $0.22 per pound. ""Paraxylene prices appear to be coming up,"" said Salomon Brothers energy industry analyst Paul Ting.
On olefins, Carl said, ""Olefins is much tougher. The trick with olefins right now is the feedstock issue hitting them. A little bit of pressure on the price side, too. Too soon to call that one, too, I think.""
He said Amoco saw refining margins decline in December. ""We're not seeing any change from that"" in Q1, he said. ""It's kind of hanging around the same place. Those refining margins continue to be below where we were a year ago on a year-to-date basis. It's still tough out there.""",0
"Eli Lilly & Co's third-quarter profits are expected to be up strongly over 1995, but analysts expressed some concern about the drugmaker's profit margins.
Increased marketing costs for the anti-depressant Prozac and the recently launched anti-schizophrenic drug Zyprexa may combine with higher sales of lower-margin goods, such as the blood clot buster ReoPro, to hold back margins, analysts said.
""One of our concerns ... is that gross profit margin could again fall below last year's level, said Deutsche Morgan Grenfell pharmaceuticals industry analyst Mariola Haggar.
Third-quarter 1995 gross margin was 74.3 percent.
The First Call consensus of 20 analysts' projections forecast third-quarter Lilly profits of $0.64 per share, up 18.5 percent from $0.54 per share a year ago.
Revenues on the quarter were expected to come in at about $1.8 billion, up from $1.63 billion in the year-ago period.
Shares in Lilly were up 3/4 to 69-1/4 on Monday ahead of the earnings report expected on Tuesday morning.
Analysts said the third quarter could be boosted by a one-time gain on the deal giving Dura Pharmaceuticals marketing rights to the antibiotics Ceclor CD and Keftab.
No significant revenue was expected to be recorded in the third quarter from Zyprexa, approved for marketing October 1, but it was expected to lift the fourth quarter. Lilly was expected to record its first revenues in the third quarter from Humalog, a new short-acting insulin, analysts said.
Under close scrutiny will be Prozac, which accounts for about a third of Lilly revenues. New prescription growth rates for the blockbuster drug were recovering but continued to lag competing products, August script reports showed.
A Lilly spokesman declined to comment on analysts' comments and forecasts.",0
"Large U.S. medical device manufacturers are expected to post strong profit gains for the third quarter, possibly speeding a flight to quality in a sector where small-cap companies are taking a beating.
Five of nine big device companies are expected to report year-over-year earnings gains of 20 percent or more, according to First Call consensus forecasts.
On the strength of actual and projected earnings, stocks in larger companies, such as Medtronic Inc and Boston Scientific Corp, are rallying from a summer slump.  
""There hasn't been much of a bounce in the small-cap names. Instead, you're seeing a flight to quality ... Investor sentiment is clearly shifting,"" said Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette medical technology analyst Steven Halper.
As the market turns cautious on loss-making start-ups, major manufacturers are entering a new period of abundance that makes them attractive, analysts said.
""This quarter will suggest that, in fact, the bigger companies are some of the best positioned in the medical technology field. They have a surfeit of new technology and new products,"" said Montgomery Securities analyst Kurt Kruger.  
Products are making it to market more quickly as well, thanks to more rapid U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviews. The agency approved 37 product marketing applications in its latest fiscal year, up from 27 in the prior year and 26 in fiscal 1994, according to Montgomery Securitities' count.
""This has reduced considerably the risk in bringing a new product to market and has important commercial relevance for the industry,"" Kruger said.
Continued powerful growth in European and Asian consumer demand for U.S. medical devices also bodes well for U.S. companies big enough to take advantage of it, analysts said.

"U.S. consumers are greeting the latest home computers -- faster than ever, but lacking new whiz-bang features -- with a collective yawn.
Major U.S. electronics retailers said Thursday that home PC sales were weak in October and analysts see few signs of a recovery without lower prices or a technology breakthrough.
""Everybody seems to have stopped buying PCs all of a sudden,"" said Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Terrence McEvoy.
Defying the downdraft are mail-order computer vendors and sellers of computers to business, which are both thriving.  
Their success reflects a shifting market, analysts said.
""The business today is less first-time buyers and more repeat customers,"" said Robertson Stephens analyst Edward Lee.
The pool of entry-level buyers is contracting and the PC industry increasingly relies on second- or third-time buyers, who are smarter than novices. Veterans look for vendors offering lots of peripherals, such as CompUSA Inc, or discount mail-order houses, such as Dell Computer Corp and Gateway 2000 Inc, analysts said.
That leaves generalists, like Best Buy Co and Circuit City Stores, to fight for a shrinking market.  
Eden Prairie, Minn.-based Best Buy, with 268 stores in 31 states, reported October sales were down 15 percent from a year ago on a same-store basis and said ""the sale of personal computers was impacted by industry-wide weakness.""
Richmond, Va.-based Circuit City saw an October decline in same-store sales of nine percent and cited ""softness in the personal computer and ... consumer electronics categories.""
Disappointing results were posted by Tandy Corp, owner of the RadioShack, Computer City and Incredible Universe chains. ""Our results parallel the sluggish consumer electronics and personal computer retail market,"" Tandy said.  
""Demand is starting to dry up across the board,"" Lee said.
Best Buy shares Thursday fell 3-1/4 to 13 on the October report. Circuit City shares were up 3/8 to 34-7/8. Shares in Fort Worth, Texas-based Tandy were off 3/4 to 38-3/4.
At the same time, shares in Dell were up 1-1/2 to 88-5/8, while Gateway 2000 shares were up 3-3/4 to 52-3/4. Shares in computer and microprocessor manufacturers also rallied, with Intel Corp up 5-3/4 to 124-5/8 and International Business Machines Corp up 1 to 134-1/4.  
PC sales at this time last year were buoyed by promotions and the multi-media explosion. The home PC was transformed from a word processor into a high-quality game station and an educational tool for kids thanks to CD-ROM drives, speakers and soundcard packages and a bevy of new applications.
""Today, computers are faster than they were a year ago, but what does it do more?"" Lee asked. ""Demand is driven by applications and how it changes the typical consumer's life.""
Savvy consumers could just be waiting for lower prices, of course, and analysts said if they keep dropping, there may yet be a holiday buying burst. But without some hot new features, the shopping season for PC retailers could be a cold one.
""When you've got Intel moving up five in one day and Best Buy moving down three the same day, that tells you something ... It's a tough business,"" said Securities Corp of Iowa analyst Pat Dunkerley.",0
"Approval of Eli Lilly & Co's new anti-schizophrenia drug, Zyprexa, is expected to come soon from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, analysts said.
Marketing clearance for the drug, known generically as olanzapine, would put Lilly in the front of a parade of new anti-schizophrenia medications coming on the U.S. market.
""We expect approval yet this year ... There's been no hint of any issues"" from the FDA that might cause delay, said Lilly spokesman Edward West.
Wall Street analysts said approval could come this month.  
The FDA has not scheduled an advisory committee hearing for Zyprexa. West said Lilly has no indication that a committee hearing will be set. Analysts said the drug likely will be cleared without committee deliberations.
""The big expectation would be that Zyprexa will be approved ... That's what's on everybody's radar screen,"" said Smith Barney pharmaceuticals analyst Christina Heuer.
Zyprexa received a positive opinion in June from the European Union's Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products. European marketing approval likely will follow, analysts said.
Several competing products are in the pipeline.  
Close behind Lilly are Abbott Laboratories Inc with Serlect, Zeneca Group Plc with Seroquel and Pfizer Inc with Ziprasidone. All are expected to hit the market within the next 12 months.
Already on the market are Johnson & Johnson's Risperdal, Sandoz AG's Clozaril and the benchmark treatment available since 1967, haloperidol, as well as a host of less frequently prescribed drugs.
Studies have shown that one in 100 people is schizophrenic. Estimates of the annual U.S. market for treating the disease range from $1 billion to $4.5 billion.
Looking at the huge success of Lilly's Prozac in treating clinical depression, drugmakers are hoping to score equally impressive wins with the new anti-schizophrenics.",0
"Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Patrick Arbor said Thursday he expects electronic technology to replace open outcry trading in 20 to 25 years.
""I would think that in 20 to 25 years, there will be some kind of technology that will replace the traditional, open outcry market,"" Arbor said in answer to a student's question after a speech at the University of Chicago.
In the past, the CBOT has said it views electronic trading as a supplement to open outcry pit trading, which it has said provides maximum integrity and liquidity at minimum cost.
A CBOT press release distributed after Arbor's speech quoted him saying that ""electronic trading ... supplements open outcry during daytime hours and the evening session.""
In answer to the student's question, Arbor remarked that his 33-year-old son, a CBOT member allowed to trade in the pits, has ""got about 20 years left"" in his trading career.
Arbor added, ""Technology is the wave of the future. There's no question about it.""
Electronic trading remains a small part of the total volume of trading done on the CBOT, but is growing rapidly.
Total trading volume on the exchange in 1995 was more than 210 million contracts and Arbor predicted record-setting volume in 1996. Electronic trading increased to an average daily volume of 7,397 contracts in the first quarter of 1996 from just 560 contracts in 1992, when it commenced.
""The growth of electronic trading is here. It's going to continue,"" Arbor said.",0
"General Instrument Corp pleased Wall Street Tuesday by announcing a three-way corporate break-up that analysts said will unlock the value of the company's core high-tech communications systems business.
""Generally, these things work in the sense that when you do the spinoff, the sum of the parts tends to be greater than the initial whole,"" said industry analyst Hickman Powell at Southeast Research Partners.
At the same time, the planned creation of three new companies raises some questions, analysts said.
Chicago-based General Instrument said it will create a company to be called NextLevel Systems Inc out of its cable television, satellite and telephone businesses.
Also planned is creation of a new firm called CommScope Inc out of a world-leading coaxial cable manufacturing business, and General Semiconductor Inc out of electronic component manufacturing operations.
""Investors will be able to value each of the three companies on its own merits and growth fundamentals,"" said General Instrument chief executive Richard Friedland.
Shares in General Instrument were up 1/4 to 23 at midday.
The prize to emerge from the bust-up will be NextLevel, focused on high-speed modems, television cable set-top boxes and other hot areas. ""That's where the growth is,"" said analyst Louis Ehrenkrantz of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
But some analysts questioned how the business will fund its growth after being stripped of the coaxial and semiconductor businesses, which throw off large cash flows.
""The answer must be that that portion will have to, from time to time, come to the equity market,"" Powell said, adding that a recent optic fiber deal with NYNEX Corp bodes well for NextLevel.
Optic fiber is replacing coaxial cable in many places, especially along communications trunk lines, which may pose a threat to the distant future of CommScope, analysts said.
But Powell pointed out, ""There's still quite a lot of the world to be cabled up...That company, by the way, has been gaining market share.""
Finally, General Semiconductor on its own will suffer from the same cyclical swings in the electronic components markets that drove it as a unit of General Instrument, analysts said.
""Two-thirds of that company are going to be very good stocks. The semi-conductor unit, well, it will come along when the semiconductors recover,"" Ehrenkrantz said.
General Instrument said the break-up will force it to take charges against earnings of as much as $135 million on its fourth quarter results due February 10 and later this year.",0
"Colombian stocks have shaken off three years of stagnation to stage a meteoric rise in 1997, but bourse chiefs warn deep-rooted structural problems cloud the outlook for one of the world's best-performing markets so far this year.
The country's two major indices, Bogota's IBB and Medellin's IBOMED, have gained more than 22 percent in the 10 sessions of the year to Thursday, Jan. 16, grabbing international attention and sending investors reeling with surprise.  
Brokers are convinced that bigger gains are still to come in the course of the year and that Colombian stocks continue to be undervalued by as much as 25 percent.
But the chairmen of the Bogota and Medellin exchanges believe the traditional ""marriage"" between industrialists and bankers will hamper the transformation of Colombia's markets into sophisticated, modern bourses.
""Market performance has been pretty good in the year so far and we've seen gains that nobody really dared foresee,"" said Luis Fernando Uribe, head of the Medellin exchange.  
Bogota's IBB has gained about 22.5 percent -- despite small falls on profit-taking Wednesday and Thursday after 18 days straight gains.  It rose just 11.8 percent in peso terms in 1996 -- a real-term loss when set against 21.63 percent inflation.
Medellin's IBOMED index has leapt more than 23 percent after losing 3.68 percent in nominal terms in 1996.
Trading volume is extremely thin, however.  Volume on all three of the country's exchanges, including Cali's tiny Bolsa de Occidente, totalled just $2.3 billon in 1996.  
Market perception that Colombian shares are well below book price, a fall in deposit rates from above 30 percent for most of 1996 to about 27 percent, and optimism that the economy is about to rebound from the sharp slowdown last year are underpinning the rally.  And a new tax on fixed income papers has also put a premium on equities, many brokers say.
""Once the market caught fire everybody piled in. There was not too much differentiation between shares, which shows these are still somewhat immature markets,"" said market analyst Stephen Edkins.  
""We're bullish about the year and think shares will rise between about 40 percent and 45 percent overall,"" he added. Inflation is forecast to hit 18 percent this year, which would mean real-term yields of up to 27 percent.
Edkins expected to see downward corrections of between five percent and 10 percent in the coming weeks, with new gains from the start of the second quarter as companies turn in 1996 year-end results, followed by first quarter results.
Domestic political factors, including the country's simmering guerrilla war, which some military experts predict will intensify in 1997, seem unlikely to cause concern.  
""We've got this crazy equilibrium where there's quite a solid macroeconomic management and then this element of chaos,"" said Edkins.  But amid the optimism, bourse chiefs Caballero and Uribe sounded a warning.
""The main underlying problem is that there are a lack of shares.  That's a structural problem and cannot be resolved overnight,"" said Caballero.
""There are favorable terms for companies to raise capital in the stock market but the traditional marriage between industry and the financial sector is not going to be easy to break up,"" said Uribe.
Colombian entrepreneurs still prefer to contract debt with the banks rather than risk losing overall control of their businesses by issuing shares.
Of all the country's major conglomerates only the Sindicato Antioqueno has more than one of its companies quoted on the stock market -- but less than one-third of the shares are in free float, outside the direct control of the companies themselves.",0
"Colombia's main oil union postponed a decision to launch an indefinite strike in protest against the arrest of 11 members on terrorism charges after top-level talks with the government Sunday night, leaders said.
The 5,700-strong USO union, known for its fiercely nationalistic stance, had been due to set a start date for a crippling stoppage at a general assembly Monday. Industrial action would have begun ""soon after"" Monday's meeting, union head Hernando Hern ndez said last week.",0
"Colombian truckers began climbing back behind the wheel early on Friday after their leaders signed a deal with the government to end their crippling 11-day old strike.
Colombian Truck Drivers' Association (ACC) head Javier Suarez said the accord granted an immediate 16 percent raise in cargo freight rates with the promise of another inflation-linked increase at the start of next year -- short of the instant 30 percent hike originally demanded.
The breakthrough in talks between the independent association, the Transport and Interior Ministries and private transport companies came late on Thursday, a day after Interior Minister Horacio Serpa threatened to use police and the military to help smash the nationwide strike by clearing road blocks and forcing truckers back to work.
""This is a partial solution to our problems but I think it will be good for our members. This doesn't mean truckers will now be making any profits but at least we won't be operating at a loss like at present,"" Suarez told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""We have also agreed to set up a joint committee that will look at future transport policies.""
Key sectors of the economy, primarily those linked to import and export, had issued stiff criticism of the transport paralysis earlier in the day but heaved a collective sigh of relief with news of the agreement.
But the lifting of the strike seems unlikely to offer an instant fix for the crisis-hit coffee sector, which has seen 250,000 60-kg sacks of coffee -- a quarter of that promised for October delivery -- delayed by the truckers' action.
Earlier in the week, private coffee exporters said many would be forced to default on this month's delivery contracts even if the stoppage ended before the weekend because of the backlog of coffee in port and in warehouses.
In addition to the raise in freight cargo rates, a joint committee of truckers, industry representatives and Transport Ministry officials will be created to look at other concerns highlighted by the drivers' association, Transport Minister Carlos Hernan Lopez said.
These include the cost of highway tolls, the price of operating licenses and associated taxes and maximum load restrictions on cargoes.
Part of Thursday night's agreement means the Transport Ministry will send a communique to transport companies ordering them to lift unilateral bans on contracting the services of drivers operating trucks more than 11 years old where these are currently in force.
Suarez said he did not think the deal hammered out would have an impact on inflation, already running above the 18 percent originally targetted at this point in the year by the government.
""Hopefully we will not see any gains in inflation or the cost of this accord being passed on to the consumers because the intermediaries, the transport companies, will be absorbing the cost of it by taking a cut in their profit margins,"" he said.
The overall cost of the strike is difficult to calculate but certainly runs into many million dollars. Colombia's main Pacific coast port, Buenaventura, estimated its losses at more than $20 million a day because no cargo was coming in or out.",0
"Another member of Colombia's main oil workers' union was arrested on terrorist charges, a union leader said Sunday on the eve a meeting to set the start date for a strike that could paralyze the industry.
The capture of Edgar Riano in Huila province Saturday came after the arrest of 12 others Thursday -- 10 of them from the USO oil union.
All are accused of carrying out dynamite attacks on the country's oil pipelines and of links to the National Liberation Army (ELN), the country's second largest guerrilla force. The chief prosecutor's office was unavailable for comment on the latest detention.
USO head Hernando Hernandez said last Thursday the union would fix the ""zero hour"" for the start of an indefinite strike to protest the wave of arrests at an extraordinary assembly Monday. The action is also to oppose government plans for what the union sees as the creeping privatization of state-run oil company Ecopetrol, Hernandez said.
Following a merger between the 5,700-strong USO and smaller oil workers' associations, the strike could spread to the private sector, including foreign multinationals operating in Colombia.
USO leaders were due to meet Colombian Interior Minister Horacio Serpa Sunday evening to discuss the arrest of members and the planned walkout. The government seems likely to declare an oil workers' strike illegal on the grounds that it is affecting a key sector of the economy.
Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar said Friday that Ecopetrol had enough fuel reserves to meet demand for 19 days and said any shortfalls in domestic supply could be made up by increasing imports in the event of a USO strike.
A 24-hour stoppage by USO workers in mid-October paralyzed pumping -- 350,000 barrels a day -- along the country's two main oil pipelines for the first time ever.
In a separate incident in the oil town of Barrancabermeja, two unidentified assailants blasted local USO official Gilberto Carreno at close range with a shotgun and wounded as he left a bar Saturday morning.
USO social services secretary Gustavo Triana the motives for the attack were unclear. Members of USO, known for its fiercely nationalistic stance, have frequently been targeted by right-wing paramilitaries who accuse the union of backing the ELN.",0
"Thousands of demonstrators thronged Bogota's streets on Sunday calling for an end to the crime wave that has turned Colombia into the kidnap capital of the world.
A small bomb exploded minutes before the march began about 100 yards (90 metres) from where demonstrators gathered but did not cause any injuries, police said. A spokesman said the device contained just a few ounces (under 100 grams) of explosive and was probably simply intended to sow panic.
At least 1,100 people have been abducted this year -- more than half of those by warring factions in Colombia's simmering internal conflict -- according to march organisers.
National Police chief Rosso Jose Serrano, who took part in the first march of its kind in Colombia, saw it as a direct challenge to leftist guerrillas, who fill their war chests with ransoms. Scores of others clutched photos in silent tribute to their loved ones -- kidnapped by criminals.
""When you're abducted you become like the living dead -- it strips you of your soul. Today's march is a sign that civil society is saying no to kidnap,"" said Francisco Santos, founder of Pais Libre, an independent foundation that counsels kidnap victims' families and which organised Sunday's march.
Santos, part of the family that runs Colombia's leading newspaper, was kidnapped six years ago as part of a campaign unleashed by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cartel.
In a move timed to coincide with Sunday's protest, one of Colombia's most-feared right-wing paramilitary leaders released the mothers of two guerrilla chieftains in the northwest.
The women were snatched in a wave of retaliatory kidnappings carried out by Carlos Castano's paramilitary gang in the last six months in a bid to persuade the guerrilla chief to halt its campaign of abductions.
An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people took part in the march. Organisers put the figure at twice that.
Norberto Garcia, 62, tearfully watched the march and subsequent rally in the historic Plaza Bolivar square. Almost a year ago to the day his 14-year-old daughter Andrea disappeared on her way to school in a working-class district of the capital.
""When your child is kidnapped it is like your own life ends. It's the hardest thing for a parent to suffer,"" Garcia said.
Only last Wednesday, the country was rocked by the kidnap and murder of seven-year-old schoolboy Victor Alvarez in southwest Colombia. His corpse was dumped on the doorstep of his family home when his parents failed to pay common criminals a $10,000 ransom.
But in a country where even conservative estimates put the number of abductions at three a day, the tragedy of young Victor, of Popayan, was almost forgotten by Sunday.
Anti-kidnap czar Alberto Villamizar was jeered by crowds as he delivered a message from President Ernesto Samper pledging to crack down on kidnapping.
The catcalls were preceeded by chants of ""Serrano will save the motherland"", in support of the no-nonsense chief of National Police, who heads the fight against kidnapping and drug-trafficking.",0
"Moves toward just-in-time roasting and savage cuts in coffee inventories in consumer countries will force exporters, traders and processors to resort to sophisticated financial mechanisms to offset price volatility, the head of the International Coffee Organization said.
ICO chief Celsius Lodder predicted booming growth in risk management measures such as options, futures and secondary instruments and said they would become key in influencing short and medium term coffee prices.  
They will also replace more traditional methods of building up stocks, and other physical strategies, as a buffer to sudden swings in the market, he said.
Meanwhile, in some producer countries, growers may find themselves bearing an increasing responsibility for storing the crop, thereby seeing their costs pushed up.
""Risk management, similar to an insurance contract, will become an increasingly important instrument for exporters, traders and processors,"" Lodder said in a speech organized by Bogota's Los Andes University.  
""Growers and growers' cooperatives will have to take on greater responsibilities for storing inventories. This will push up costs, reduce their cash flow and mean much of the stocks will be stored in remote areas, delaying dispatch,"" the coffee chief said.
Despite the grim message that shifting trends in consumer countries could force their costs up higher, Lodder did offer a ray of hope for Colombian growers, already hard hit by the strengthening peso and the high cost of credit.  
Lodder highlighted the growing opportunity for niche marketing of specialist coffees in traditional markets where consumer palates are becoming more sophisticated even though the overall demand in those areas may have stagnated.
He also talked up prospects of new markets opening in the former Soviet Union and China. Colombia's President Ernesto Samper, and his official delegation, returned from the Far East at the end of last week. His itinerary included China and both he and his Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia were upbeat about the chance of selling the Colombian bean to the country's 1.3 billion-strong population.  
During the visit to Beijing and Shanghai, Mejia calculated that if Colombia could sell one cup of coffee a day to every inhabitant of China, the Communist nation would absorb Colombia's entire annual harvest.
National Coffee Growers' Federation chief Jorge Cardenas did his own calculations and worked out that Colombia would have to double its coffee harvest if it was looking to meet Mejia's target.
In his speech, Lodder recognized the ICO's changing role and agreed it was no realistic for it to adopt interventionist strategies in a globalized free market.  
""The patterns of economic and political cooperation seen in the 1960s have been replaced by a new  model, perhaps more realistic and certainly different. There's no consensus for a return to intervention but the ICO is a dynamic organization and it must reflect the current situation and not be constrained by its former role,"" he said.
""I believe the ICO must remain flexible and look for the broadest possible consensus and build on the foundations of our cooperation with trade experts.""
He added that the ICO would concentrate on looking for specific solutions to specific problems as they arose throughout the coffee sector either in production or marketing.
Meanwhile, Colombia's transport system got back to normal this week after a crippling 11-day strike by truckers, which ended with an agreement early last Friday.
There has, nevertheless, been a significant delay in coffee deliveries and Cardenas forecast that about 150,000 60-kg sacks of coffee promised for October delivery would not in fact reach buyers until November.",0
"British Petroleum Co Plc gave a lukewarm reception Tuesday to a Colombian proposal that would see it losing almost half the oil-rich Piedemonte field in return for sweeter contract terms on much of the remainder.
The proposal, outlined by Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar to reporters Monday, is the latest twist in a long- running saga that has seen BP trying to boost the profit margins on its Piedemonte operations while Colombia seeks to sidestep criticism that it is allowing multinationals to call the shots.  
Piedemonte, in Colombia's eastern plains is estimated to contain between 600 million and one billion barrels of crude oil and condensates.
But so far BP has only pinpointed three hydrocarbon formations -- Volcanera, Pauto and Florena -- accounting for about 15 percent of the total area, arguing that current overheads do not make it profitable to explore the rest.  
If Villamizar's complex proposal were accepted, a BP spokesman said it would require the company to hand back rights to the 85 percent of the Piedemonte field that is still virtually unexplored, with the guarantee that state oil company Ecopetrol would re-award BP half that area under improved contract terms.
The spokesman for BP's Colombian subsidiary, BP Exploration Co (Colombia) Ltd, told Reuters: ""This is an interesting proposal but we regret that this solution would mean losing access to what is a large proportion of the Piedemonte field.""  
He conceded it may be a possible way forward but indicated that it represented little more than an opening gambit in the search for a new working formula between BP, Colombia's single largest foreign investor, and Ecopetrol.
Under the so-called ""sliding scale"" terms of the existing Piedemonte association contract, profits are divided equally between BP and Ecopetrol while production remains below 60 million barrels. Ecopetrol's share rises as production increases, topping out at 76 percent when output hits 150 million barrels.  
BP had been pressing for the entire Piedemonte contract to be renegotiated using the new-style Factor R, which takes account of investment and operating costs in individual fields to ensure adequate profit margins for foreign companies.
But those demands were rejected by Villamizar last month following a congressional debate. Villamizar's new proposal, however, would open the way for a Factor R contract to be drawn up on that area of the Piedemonte field which BP would cede and then win back. Ecopetrol would then operate the rest of field itself or contract it to other private oil companies.  
Gustavo Triana, a senior official of the powerful USO oil workers' union, known for its fierce opposition to multinationals, said the union would not readily welcome any ""underhand deal"" that granted better terms to BP after the government had said it would not do so.",0
"Colombian police said on Sunday they discovered a second multimillion-dollar drug stash aboard a yacht owned by three Britons being held on cocaine smuggling charges stemming from a bust on the yacht in December.
The three men Michael Hayne, 50, of Egham, Surrey, his son Stephen Alan Hayne, 27, of Ashford, Kent, and David Maurice Shaw, 49, of Oldham, Lancashire, were arrested on Dec. 13 in the Caribbean coast port of Barranquilla and were being held on cocaine smuggling charges.
At the time, officials of the state security force DAS discovered more than 425 pounds (194 kg) of highly pure cocaine aboard their U.S.-registered boat Perla del Mar (Sea Pearl). In a more exhaustive search, conducted over the weekend, police turned up another 326 pounds (148 kg) of cocaine -- stowed away in the vessel's waste water tanks.
A DAS chief estimated the street value of the first haul at $50 million. Police declined on Sunday to speculate on the overall value of the illicit consignment.
""The drugs were coated with a mixture of burned oil and coffee, which masks the smell and makes it more difficult for sniffer dogs to detect,"" a Barranquilla police spokesman said.
The Britons were being held in custody in Barranquilla's El Modelo jail. They could not be contacted on Sunday.
In a phone conversation in December, Michael Hayne told Reuters the situation had been a ""huge mix-up"" and hoped everything would be ""straightened out soon.""
DAS officials said Hayne, whose passport was issued by the British Embassy in Spain, and his son had entered Colombia illegally from Venezuela. Shaw entered Colombia legally -- his passport had been issued by the British High Commission in Trinidad.
A spokeswoman for the regional prosecutor's office said the men could face between four and 12 years behind bars if convicted of the smuggling charges.
Colombian laws on drug trafficking are frequently seen as lax compared to standards in Britain and the United States.
The country's cocaine kings Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, heads of the once-mighty Cali drug cartel were sentenced 10 days ago.",0
"A powerful car bomb rocked a residential district of Medellin early on Monday, killing a woman and injuring at least 48 other people, police said.
About 120 pounds (50 kg) of dynamite packed into a minibus blew up outside the house of Juan Gomez Martinez, a regional newspaper editor, politician and former provincial governor.
The Colombian government said it suspected drug cartels were behind the massive blast. President Ernesto Samper vowed not to bow to terrorist violence from drug traffickers.
""We will not allow the specter of narco-terrorism to return to this country and intimidate us,"" he told reporters. ""The state will combat these acts of violnce head-on.""
Five unidentified gunmen, one of them a woman, opened fire on private security guards near Gomez's home before the bomb went off, Medellin police chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado said.
He said three houses were virtually destroyed and 15 others seriously damaged by the explosion.
The dead woman was identified as Lucia Cevallos de Bernal, 60, who lived near the site of the blast. Gomez was not home at the time but one of his three sons was injured.
Authorities offered a $150,000 reward for information leading to the capture of those responsible.
""This is a savage act. The first indications point to drug traffickers but I don't want to draw premature conclusions,"" said Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra.
The attack came three days after the Colombian Congress approved a tough new law to strip Colombia's cocaine barons of their multi-billion dollar fortunes. Another bill to introduce stiffer jail terms for drug traffickers is due to come up for discussion in a special session of Congress later this week.
But it was not clear why Gomez, who is not a congressman, should have been targeted.
Gomez is a member of the opposition Conservative Party and head of the regional El Colombiano newspaper, which has its headquarters in Medellin, once home to the world's most powerful cocaine cartel.
His newspaper recently printed an interview with Carlos Castano, leader of a feared right-wing death squad, whose main target is leftist rebels and their supporters.
A few hours after the blast an unknown group calling itself the Special Anti-Paramilitary Commando issued a communique, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declaring war on paramilitary groups. The group claimed to be made up of ex-guerrillas who had previously laid down their arms and accused the state of sponsoring paramilitary groups.
Medellin was scarred by violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s when drug lord Pablo Escobar waged a successful war to force Colombia's Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.
In June last year a bomb killed 28 people in the city centre. Nobody claimed responsibility for that blast.",0
"A former German secret agent and his wife were formally charged with abduction on Wednesday after their bid to smuggle a rebel kidnap victim out of Colombia backfired at the weekend.
The charges, announced by the chief prosecutor's office, brought another twist to a brewing scandal that has set the Colombian government at odds with German diplomats and businessmen over clandestine payments to kidnappers.
Police and Colombian officials accuse Werner Mauss, 56, of being an international member of the country's National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla force, or a mercenary negotiating the release of abducted foreigners in return for a cut of the ransom.
In a statement issued in Bonn on Wednesday, German government official Peter Hausmann said the government was ""fully informed"" of the former state security agent's mission and welcomed such ""unconventional methods to rescue Germans from life and death situations.""
Mauss and Silvia Schroder, 36, were seized at Rionegro airport near Medellin early on Sunday as they tried to bundle a third German, Brigitte Schoene, the wife of a former BASF Chemicals executive, aboard a private charter plane bound for Venezuela. Schoene was kidnapped in mid-August by the ELN, which had demanded $6 million for her release.
In its press release, the chief prosecutor's office referred to Mauss and his wife as Juergen and Isabel Seidel -- one of their many aliases. The couple were remanded in custody.
An executive secretary of Siemens-Colombia said on Wednesday she had hired the plane that Mauss was to use for his getaway on the orders of a top industrialist formerly based in Bogota.
Security experts say Colombia -- home to Latin America's longest-running guerrilla war -- is swarming with foreign mercenaries carrying out shadowy undercover missions as kidnappings reportedly run at almost one every 2-1/2 hours.
""Many multinationals are hiring so-called security advisers for kidnap, terrorist and extortion situations but these are simply mercenaries and adventurers willing to make pacts with kidnappers and guerrillas,"" said private security consultant Col. Luis Enrique La Rotta.
Parliamentarian Guillermo Martinez, a retired air force officer, told Reuters he was sure dozens of foreign mercenaries like Mauss had poured into Colombia to carry out hostage rescue missions.
""Regardless of whether the Colombian authorities can or cannot control the (kidnap) situation it is totally unacceptable for foreign companies to fly in mercenaries to do this type of work,"" he said.",0
"The Colombian authorities hailed Wednesday the U.S. pilot who was killed during an anti-drug mission over guerrilla-infested jungles of southeast Colombia as a ""hero fighting the scourge of narco-trafficking.""
Robert Martin, 35, of Lubbock, Texas, died when his Turbo Thrush T-65 crop dusting plane crashed in Guaviare province Tuesday. He had been fumigating illicit plantations of coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine.
Colombian Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra, police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano and U.S. ambassador Myles Frechette were among mourners at a religious service in Bogota to honour Martin. A lone bugler played the ""Last Post"" and the U.S. flag was draped over Martin's coffin.
""We're not here to bid farewell to a pilot or to a U.S. citizen. We're here to say goodbye to a hero who decided to join us in combatting one of the worst scourges known to mankind -- narco-trafficking,"" Serrano said.
Police said Martin, one of six U.S. civilian pilots working in Colombia under contract with the U.S. State Department, was killed on the first day of his contract. Frechette said he was the first U.S. aviator to die on such a mission.
As police cadets mounted a guard of honour for Martin and three police helicopters flew in formation overhead, Frechette pledged the fatality would not affect U.S.-Colombian cooperation in the drug war.
The question of U.S. personnel taking a direct role in drug or counterinsurgency operations is a traditionally thorny issue because of what Colombian politicians see as the possible infringement of national sovereignty.
Crop-dusting planes come under frequent attack from armed gangs and leftist guerrillas who guard the clandestine drug plantations.
Police chief Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano said Tuesday there was a heavy rebel presence in the area but said there was no indication the aircraft had come under fire. He said a full investigation was under way, adding the most likely cause of the crash was human error or mechanical failure.",0
"Colombia will announce cuts in coffee exports next week under the terms of a beefed up retention plan recently agreed by members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), coffee czar Jorge Cardenas said on Thursday.
The head of the National Coffee Growers' Federation also said Colombia's internal coffee price would be raised in view of recent gains in international markets. He did not, however, say when the hike would take effect nor what the percentage rise would be.
In the provinces, meanwhile, coffee growers are becoming increasingly worried about potential crop damage caused by recent torrential downpours, which meteorologists say have pushed rainfall levels up to 160 percent higher than the seasonal average. Weather forecasters say the outlook for February is just as bad.
Under terms of the ACPC deal hammered out in Rio de Janeiro on Jan. 23, member nations will slash back total exports by 1.3 million bags in the first half of 1997 from the original target of 26.28 million bags set in May.
One million bags of that will be robusta but arabica- producing countries, like Colombia, agreed to rein back 300,000 bags of exports in solidarity. Cardenas declined to specify what proportion of the cut would correspond to Colombia.
""The cuts will respond to production conditions and the export situation in each individual country. We will be announcing the cuts this will imply for Colombia next week,"" Cardenas told Reuters.
As speculation grew this week that the federation would announce the rise in internal coffee prices at its first meeting of the year Friday, Jan. 31, private exporters complained of short supplies.
""Intermediaries and producers have increased prices to scandalous levels in anticipation of a rise in the internal coffee price. Some are just holding on and won't even sell. In some cases prices are up by as much as 10 percent,"" said Alvaro Ramirez of Cargill exporters.
""In view of the situation in external markets, we will of course have to raise the internal price of coffee,"" Cardenas said. ""We will do the projections and take the decision on the basis of that,"" he said.
The federation cut internal coffee prices by 14,000 pesos per 125-kg load to 221,500 after a turbulent coffee growers' congress on Dec. 5. The move aimed to reduce the deficit of the Coffee Fund, an organization administered by the federation which buys all Colombian coffee at a pre-agreed support price.
The cut was achieved by withdrawing a 14,000 peso premium, paid in the form of a bond instead of cash, which had been introduced to compensate for the poor outlook for coffee in the 1996 calendar year.
The good news on the internal price front, however, is taking a back seat to the recent weather problems.
""In the southwest and Andean regions, and particularly the coffee growing region, rainfall has been as much as 160 percent higher than normal,"" said Leonardo Rivera, meteorologist at the national weather center IDEAM.
""These conditions will be prolonged and we're likely to see similar levels of rainfall through February,"" he added.
January and February are normally dry months in Colombia. But the torrential rains this year have been caused by a cooling in the surface temperature of the Pacific ocean, known as the La Nina effect -- conditions not seen for at least the last 10 years.
Coffee growers say the rains are delaying the flowering period and fear the main harvest, which normally begins in October, could either be very late or that a part could be lost entirely.
Cardenas said it was too early to predict what the impact of the weather could be on crop levels but said federation technicians were drawing up a detailed report, which they hoped to issue in mid-February.",0
"British Petroleum Co Plc considers its Piedemonte prospect in eastern Colombia ""fundamental"" to its worldwide operations despite drilling problems and wrangles over the exploitation contract, a top company official said Thursday.
John Doust, executive director of BP's local subsidiary, British Petroleum Exploration (Colombia) Ltd, predicted the field, still at the test stage, could come on stream by the end of 1999.
He estimated the total cost of developing the field, estimated to contain between 600 million and one billion barrels of crude and condensates, could run to about $2.2 billion, some of which would be shared by state oil company Ecopetrol.
""The oil project currently under way in the Piedemonte is fundamental for the worldwide organisation of the BP group,"" Doust said in a speech to journalists.
His recognition of the strategic importance of the 287,000 hectare block, in which BP has pinpointed three promising hydrocarbon formations after exploring just 15 percent of the total area, once again raises the question how BP will push the Colombian government for sweeter contract terms.
BP, Colombia's single largest foreign investor, argues that given tough drilling conditions, the terms of its so-called sliding scale association contract with Ecopetrol makes it unprofitable to exploit the field.
Under the existing contract, Ecopetrol's share of the profits rise as production increases from 50 percent to a maximum 76 percent.
BP has been pushing for a so-called R Factor contract -- which the Colombian government has so far denied -- which would take account of investment and operating costs to ensure adequate profit margins.
""We understand the uncertainty of the (Piedemonte) issue and the nature of the debate have caused uneasiness amongst many people... Let us keep in mind that we are truly seeking to achieve a break-even point and a platform of confidence for BP so that we can operate in an internationally competitive economic position,"" Doust said.
Last month, Colombia's Mines and Energy Minister Rodrigo Villamizar proposed BP should hand back rights to the 85 percent of the block that is virtually unexplored with the guarantee that Ecopetrol would re-award BP half that area under R Factor conditions at a later date and contract out the remainder to other companies.
Doust said BP was ""seriously considering"" the proposal. It is understood, however, that BP would be loath to surrender the rights to almost 50 percent of a block with huge potential under the current offer on the table.
BP has recently been hit by allegations of indirect links to right-wing paramilitary death squads that have assassinated social leaders close to its operations in eastern Colombia.
Doust blamed the accusations on a campaign to discredit the company and repeated earlier statements that he had invited the country's chief prosecutor to carry out an in-depth investigation into the claims.",0
"At least 23 people were murdered in attacks in central and northern Colombia, including an entire family hacked to death with machetes, police said on Thursday.
Unidentified axe and machete-wielding assailants killed three children, their mother and grandparents early on Thursday in San Miguel de Sema, in central Boyaca province, police chief Col. Humberto Prieto said.
""We're investigating to see if these killings are related to the death of two other relatives several years ago. Early indications suggest they were murdered for personal reasons -- a revenge attack,"" Prieto said.
Boyoca is known as a stronghold of right-wing paramilitary groups but Prieto said San Miguel was not affected by right-wing or leftist political violence.
In northern Sucre province, the bullet-ridden bodies of 17 peasants were found scattered in four isolated areas near the town of Tolu Viejo on Thursday morning, police said.
""We're still looking at all the facts. The province has been hard hit by subversion,"" said Benjamin Irragori, regional head of the state security service DAS.
He said two fronts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were active in the area.
Sucre has seen a recent rash of attacks by right-wing paramilitary death squads. One television report, which quoted a police source as saying the leading suspects in the massacre were rightists, showed some of the dead with their hands tied behind their backs.
Almost 40 people died in a wave of killings, attributed to paramilitary groups, across northern Colombia two weeks ago. Last month, the country's paramilitary forces held a summit in which they pledged to step up their war against leftist guerrillas and rebel sympathisers.
In a separate attack in the city of Cucuta, in northeast Norte de Santander province, a Roman Catholic priest was gunned down by two unidentified killers on Wednesday evening, police said.
He was the third priest killed in two months -- a sign, some clergymen say, that they are increasingly caught in the crossfire of guerrilla and paramilitary violence, which has surged in recent months.
""The basic problem is not the lack of respect for priests but the total disregard for the value of human life,"" said Monsignor Juan Francisco Sarasti, vice president of Colombia's Episcopal Conference.",0

"At least four people were killed and scores more injured on Tuesday afternoon when a powerful bomb ripped through a building in Monteria, the main town of Colombia's northwest Cordoba province, police said.
The blast occurred at 3:15 p.m. (2015 GMT) at the headquarters of the Fondo Ganadero, a fund set up to promote cattle-ranching in the province. Police said they did not know the motive behind the attack.
The explosion came a day after a 120-pound (50-kg) car bomb went off in Medellin, killing a woman and injuring 48 people. Authorities blamed that attack on drug traffickers in league with leftist guerrillas.
Armed left and right-wing groups are waging a fierce battle in northwest Colombia where both blasts occurred.
""I cannot say yet who was responsible for this attack,"" provincial governor Carlos Buelvas told reporters. ""Everybody must be on their guard.""
He said an emergency meeting of the provincial security council, which includes the military and the police, would be called to analyse the situation.
The blast in the downtown area of the small town was the second in Monteria in the last two months. An 88 pound (40 kg) bomb, hidden in a street vendor's cart, exploded outside the town's police headquarters on Oct. 21, injuring 10 people in an attack that was blamed on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the largest guerrilla movement.
It is not clear whether Tuesday's bomb was linked to a communique issued Monday by a hitherto unknown group calling itself the Special Anti-paramilitary Commando.
The group, claiming to be made up of ex-rebels who had previously given up armed struggle, declared war on the country's burgeoning right-wing paramilitary gangs. Human rights groups accuse cattle ranchers of backing them.
Defence Minister Juan Carlos Esguerra said, however, that he believed Monday's attack in Medellin was retaliation for approval last week by Congress of a new law to strip drug lords of their billion-dollar fortunes.
Colombia's main cities, and particularly Medellin, were scarred by a drug-fuelled campaign of bombings, assassinations and kidnappings in the late 1980s when cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar waged war on the state in a successful bid to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.",0
"A leading lawmaker said on Monday that Colombia would continue to be a ""paradise for drug traffickers"" unless Congress voted to overturn a 5-year-old ban on the extradition of drug lords and other criminals wanted abroad.
""If we don't end the culture of impunity in Colombia then we have no right to ask for international help in the fight against drugs,"" said Senator Luis Guillermo Giraldo.
Giraldo, a member of the ruling Liberal party but an outspoken opponent of President Ernesto Samper, proposed legislation in August that would reactivate a 1979 extradition treaty with the United States.
The legislation faces a key hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday when a 12-member constitutional committee was set to vote on whether it should be submitted to plenary for approval or thrown out altogether.
""If we don't restore our (extradition) treaty, Colombia will continue to be a paradise for drug traffickers,"" Giraldo said in a telephone interview with Reuters.
In the run-up to the vote in the Senate, graffiti has appeared in Cali, home to the criminal syndicate that has dominated the world's cocaine trade, threatening those who support sending Colombians to stand trial abroad.
But growing numbers of legislators appear to be increasingly swayed by the United States' argument that extradition is a vital weapon in the drug war. Moreover, some political analysts believe it may be impossible for Colombia to regain U.S. certification as an ally in the fight against drugs, withdrawn in March, unless extradition is reintroduced.
Samper, dogged by accusations that he took drug money to finance his 1994 election campaign, said on Friday he thought Giraldo's bill was poorly timed, arguing that priority should be given to a package of tougher penalties for drug crimes currently going through Congress.
Justice Minister Carlos Medellin has spoken out in favour of renewing extradition, however, and Alfonso Valdivieso, chief prosecutor and a fervent anti-drug crusader, has even called for extradition to be made retroactive -- a proposal unlikely to please those drug traffickers who surrendered to the Colombian authorities in return for lenient treatment.
While politicians, ministers and lawyers argue the merits of the move, more than 60 percent of ordinary Colombians surveyed by RCN radio in September said they opposed extradition.
Political analysts say such opposition reflected a combination of nationalistic pride and fear that renewing extradition could unleash a new campaign of bombings, kidnappings and assassinations like those led by the late drug lord Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s.",0
"The general who led a bloody assault on Colombia's Supreme Court to quell leftist rebels holding 300 hostages in 1985 said on Friday that an attack was an option to end the Japanese embassy residence siege in Lima.
Gen. Jesus Armando Arias said Peru's President Alberto Fujimori should not cave in to the demands of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) to free jailed comrades.
Elite forces from the United States, Israel or Britain could flush out the rebels with a ""minimum of bloodshed"" if they refused to negotiate, Arias told Reuters.
More than 100 people, mostly hostages and including 11 top judges, died in the 27-hour battle Arias led to dislodge M-19 guerrillas from Bogota's Palace of Justice in Nov. 1985.
""Training techniques have progressed rapidly and there are elite forces that have the ability to seize back the (Japanese embassy residence in Lima) with the minimum of blood and damage,"" Arias said in a phone interview.
""But given the strong international interests in this case the Peruvian government should try to negotiate and reach an agreement. Bowing to the MRTA's demands on releasing prisoners would, however, set a dangerous legal precedent,"" he said.
Arias, who now teaches at a military academy, said he still believed the assault he led was the correct tactic. ""The M-19 broke in killing people right, left and centre. We could only respond in kind to that type of violence,"" he said.
Television images showed tanks firing 90mm shells into the courts building before smashing down the steel entrance doors remain vivid. Dynamite and automatic weapons fire reduced the interior of the building to rubble. More than 11 years later it has still not been fully reconstructed.
Another official involved in that incident, former Justice Minister Enrique Parejo, said the Colombian military ignored the government's orders and went ahead with the assault. He said Fujimori must keep a tight control on Peru's military if he wanted to avoid another bloodbath.
Five years before the Palace of Justice attack, the M-19 stormed the Dominican embassy in Bogota. It held 57 hostages, including 19 diplomats, for 61 days before Fidel Castro intervened and negotiated the rebels' safe passage to Cuba.
The M-19 leader who led the Dominican embassy siege, Rosemberg Pavon, called on the MRTA earlier this week to keep its cool and offered to act as go-between in the Lima drama.",0
"A powerful car bomb exploded in the northwest city of Medellin early on Monday, killing one woman and injuring at least 15 other people, police chief Gen. Alfredo Salgado said.
About 120 pounds (50 kg) of dynamite was packed into a minibus and detonated outside the house of Juan Gomez Martinez, a regional newspaper editor and former provincial governor.
Four unidentified gunmen opened fire on private security guards near Gomez's home before the bomb went off about 5:30 a.m. (1030 GMT), Salgado said.
The dead woman was named as Lucia Bernal, 60, the wife of a civil engineer, who lived close to the site of the blast. Gomez was not home at the time but one of his three sons, Juan Camilo, was injured.
""We don't know the motive for this attack. It is too early to say who was behind it. We don't know if it was leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers or right-wing paramilitaries. We're looking at all the possibilities,"" Salgado said.
Gomez, a member of the opposition Conservative Party, is head of the regional El Colombiano newspaper, which has its headquarters in the industrial city of Medellin, the main city of Antioquia province.
In recent days it has been serializing an extensive interview with Carlos Castano, leader of the country's most-feared right-wing death squad, whose main target is leftist rebels and their suspected supporters.
A few hours after the bomb blast a hitherto unknown group, calling itself the Special Anti-Paramiltary Commando, issued a communique, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, declaring war on paramilitary groups in Antioquia.
The organisation, claiming to be made up of ex-guerrillas who had laid down their arms, accused serving state governor Alvaro Uribe, of the Liberal Party's right wing, of sponsoring the paramilitaries. Uribe lives close to the site of Monday's blast but it was not clear whether the communique and the attack on Gomez's house were linked.
Medellin has in the past seen some of the worst violence unleashed by the country's powerful drug cartels. It was the scene of multiple attacks by the notorious drug mafia led by the late Pablo Escobar in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The cocaine kingpin waged war against the state in a successful bid to force Congress to ban the extradition of Colombians to the United States.
Last week Congress approved a tough new law designed to strip drug lords of their illicit billion dollar fortunes. More measures including stiffer jail terms are due to be debated in an extended session of Congress this week.",0
"Mexican Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria on Thursday criticised the United States for its policy of rewarding or punishing countries based on their measures to fight drug trafficking.
During a visit to Colombia, Gurria said the so-called certification process was a barrier to cooperation in the war on drugs and renewed calls for scrapping the system, saying decisions were often based on ulterior motives.
""The process of certification inhibits cooperation and puts the country under scrutiny in a very difficult position. I believe there are much better ways of promoting cooperation,"" Gurria said at a news conference. He added that ""the decision is often based on criteria other than those that one would rationally take into consideration.""
Last year, Colombia was struck off the United States' list of allies in the drug war. Mexico came under severe criticism but managed to get certification and escape sanctions.
Mexico has since set up a ministerial contact group to address the issue with Washington, and that has led to an improved climate between the two governments, Gurria said.
Colombia has continued to come under heavy criticism from the United States for its perceived failure to crack down hard enough on drug trafficking.
Politicians and political analysts were divided on whether Colombia would regain certification this March in the wake of of a new law to strip drug kingpins of narcotics profits.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that 80 percent of the world's cocaine is supplied by Colombia while more than half that on the streets of U.S. cities has been transported through Mexico.",0
"Boeing Co defense and space group President Gerald King said the company's planned acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defense and space business was on track to close in early December.
In an interview, King also said he expected the defense and space group to remain ""a significant part of the Boeing Co"" with 30 to 40 percent of the company's total revenues ""over time.""  
King said he expected federal regulators to complete an antitrust review of the planned Rockwell deal early next month. The proposal also needs to be approved by Rockwell shareholders at a meeting set for Dec. 4 and should close within a few days after that, he said.
""Something could always happen to the merger to keep it from going through, I suppose, even though it looks like a slam dunk in comparison with some of the other things that have been done in this industry,"" King said.  
Last year defense and space revenues of $5.58 billion were 29 percent of the company's $19.52 billion in revenues, with commercial aircraft sales accounting for the rest.
This year defense and space revenues are expected to be nearly flat, while overall company revenues rise to about $22.6 billion, reflecting growth in commercial jet deliveries, said analyst Peter Jacobs of Ragen MacKenzie.
The Rockwell acquisition will add about $2.6 billion in revenue to the defense and space group next year, and King said the company has no immediate plans for further acquisitions.
""We're looking only to make this one work first,"" he said. ""If there's a next step, we'll think about that later.""
King said the defense and space group continues to pursue commercial opportunities, including the Sea Launch program, which he said was on track for initial satellite launch in mid-1998.
King also said the company and its partner, Textron Inc's Bell Helicopter division, are offering a nine-passenger civilian version of their V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft that will be available in 2001.",0
"Microsoft Corp. is expected to report a sharp slowdown in earnings growth Monday due largely to a sales surge last year when the software giant launched its Windows 95 operating system.
On average, industry analysts expect the company to post earnings of 90 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, up 15 percent from last year's 78 cents, according to First Call, which tracks earnings predictions. In last year's fiscal first quarter Microsoft reported net income of $499 million.
Analysts generally said the Redmond, Wash.-based company would post revenues in the $2.3 billion range for the period that ended Sept. 30, up from $2.02 billion.
While Microsoft's growth rate is still healthy, and results are expected to be slightly higher than in the quarter ended in June, the company is facing difficult comparisons after last year, when revenues and earnings grew more than 46 percent.
""It's a tough comparison because in the September quarter last year was the initial release of Windows 95 and all the sell-in associated with that, so it was a great quarter,"" said Chris Galvin of Hambrecht and Quist.
But he and other analysts said Microsoft's business was continuing to expand steadily, benefiting from rising sales of personal computers and the increasing penetration of Windows 95 and the more lucrative Windows NT system.
Microsoft's already-high profit margins also are rising as the company sells a growing proportion of its software by preloading it onto new computers or selling licenses to large customers rather than shrink-wrapped boxes at retail stores.
Microsoft's business is expected to gain momentum through the fiscal year as the recently updated Windows NT wins more acceptance and the company rolls out a major new version of its Office software package beginning in December.
For the full fiscal year, analysts see earnings and sales up about 20 percent over last year.
""I think NT will really start ramping in the December quarter and in the first part of '97,"" said Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie. ""It's going to be a very powerful driver of earnings.""
One cloud on Microsoft's horizon is the imminent arrival of a wave of ""thin client"" products such as the Network Computer championed by Oracle Corp. Chairman Larry Ellison.
Late this month, Sun Microsystems Inc. is expected to launch a line of products code-named ""Mr. Coffee"" based on the increasingly popular Java language, which is being positioned as an alternative to the ""Wintel"" combination of Microsoft Windows operating systems on Intel Corp. processors.
While corporate users are not rushing to desert their personal computer networks, the increasing publicity about alternatives could hurt Microsoft's stock price, which was off $1.25 Friday at $134.25 in afteroon trading on Nasdaq but still up more than 50 percent so far this year.",0
"Microsoft Corp.'s share price rose to record levels Monday despite a warning by the software giant of slowing growth in fiscal 1998.
Microsoft, which reported ""blowout"" second-quarter results on Friday, closed at $90.75, up $3.625, and sparked a broad rally on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue, with more than 18 million shares changing hands.
After the market closed Friday,the company reported second-quarter earnings equal to 57 cents a share, up from 45 cents a year earlier and easily surpassing a consensus estimate of 51 cents.
""They had a great quarter,"" said Frank Michnoff of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ""(And) the outlook for the next two quarters looks very good; they said so themselves -- uncharacteristically.""
More characteristic were comments by Microsoft executives in the earnings statement and a conference call with analysts afterward; they warned of a slowdown in growth in fiscal 1998, which begins July 1.
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown even went so far as to question the high valuation of the company's stock.
In a comment worthy of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Brown said Microsoft's high price-to-earnings multiple was a ""cause for curiosity.""
But while Piper Jaffray downgraded the stock to hold from buy, based on its 100 percent increase over the past year, few investors heeded the warning.
""They do that every year,"" Michnoff said, referring to Microsoft's conservative forecasts. ""It's a bit like the boy who cried wolf. People are just not believing it.""
Most analysts who follow Microsoft raised their earnings estimates for the company.
First Call, which tracks estimates, said a consensus of 19 analysts was that the Redmond, Wash.-based company would earn $2.33 a share for fiscal 1997, ending June 30, up from a previous consensus was $2.07. The company earned $1.72 a share in fiscal 1996.
For fiscal 1998, analysts see the company earning $2.71 a share, up from a previous consensus of $2.48.
Analysts say fiscal 1998 will be a year of tough comparisons for Microsoft after the 1995 introduction of the Windows 95 operating system, last year's upgrade of Windows NT and this year's launch of the Office 97 application upgrade.
While Microsoft plans an upgrade to Windows 95 more tightly integrated with its Internet browser, it is unlikely to derive the benefits of another price increase or significant further operating cost reductions, analysts said.
""I think that Microsoft does have a lot of hurdles to get over,"" said Rob Owens of Pacific Crest Securities, who calls the stock ""fairly valued"" at its current level of more than 30 times fiscal 1998 earnings.
But analyst Scott McAdams of Ragen MacKenzie said investors are happy to pay a premium for a company that dominates one of the biggest growth industries and consistently surpasses Wall Street expectations.
""They've delivered consistent earnings, and Wall Street hates ugly surprises,"" he said.
David Readerman of Montgomery Securities said Microsoft would like to slow the meteoric rise in its stock price, if only to meet the challenge of providing enough shares to fulfil employee stock options.
""Yet it's difficult, with such a compelling long-term growth story, to keep a great stock down,"" he said.",0
"Boeing Co, the world leader in commercial aviation, flew into the ranks of the top military contractors as well on Sunday when it announced its planned $13 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp.
Boeing's increased resources should put competitive pressure on its commercial rival, Europe's Airbus Industrie. But industry analysts said the chief benefits for Boeing would be on the military side.  
""Historically Boeing's military business was something of an also-ran,"" said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""With this transaction in one fell swoop they become a very major player.""
One analyst said the combined company could get nearly 50 percent of its revenues from government contracts, up from Boeing's historical 25 to 30 percent.  
The deal follows by little more than a week the completion of Boeing's $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defense and space business and comes just a month after McDonnell Douglas was was eliminated from consideration to build the military's 21st century joint strike fighter plane.
Instead, the Pentagon chose Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp -- the nation's largest military contractor -- to build prototype versions of the new fighter jet in a contract that could be worth $200 billion or more to the eventual winner.  
The addition of McDonnell Douglas' expertise makes Boeing ""the team to beat"" on that crucial program, said Paul Nisbet of JSA Securities.
Loss of the joint strike fighter was the final blow for McDonnell Douglas, said analyst Nick Heymann of Natwest Securities. McDonnell had already announced its intention to back away from the commercial aviation market, where it has been only a marginal player in recent years.  
""McDonnell Douglas just didn't have the resources to aggressively fund its development programs,"" he said. ""They got stretched too thin on transports and fighters and commercial, and they underinvested.""
Nevertheless the friendly all-stock deal does not necessarily mean that McDonnell Douglas executives failed in their effort to turn around the company, analysts said.
For one thing, the offer price of about $62.89 a share based on Friday's close is well beyond McDonnell's all-time high and about 10 times its level of the early 1990s, said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities.  
In addition, the merger is being done at the very beginning of an expansion cycle in the industry, meaning layoffs can be minimized and the companies have several years to rationalize their operations before the next expected downturn.
""It isn't a case that you're merging because you're starving to death,"" said Demisch. ""It's a case that there's lots of opportunity. ... That's a much healthier basis on which to consolidate.""  
Indeed, Boeing Chief Executive Phil Condit said the combined companies would have revenues of $48 billion next year, up more than 30 percent from a projected $35 billion this year.
""We are going to be going after $1 billion or more of savings a year, but we are going to be doing in it in an environment where the overall growth is occurring,"" Condit said at a news conference. ""That's the advantage we have got right now.""  
Company officials said any job losses would likely be minimal. There may be overlaps in some areas, Condit said, but he added: ""I don't think those are going to be significant numbers.""
Executives said the merger would cause ""reassignments,"" and operations were expected to continue at existing major locations, including St Louis, where McDonnell Douglas is based.
Murray Weidenbaum, chairman of the Centre for the Study of American Business at Washington University and former chief economist for Boeing, said the deal could have benefits for St. Louis.  
Boeing has a better chance of landing the $200 billion U.S. fighter-jet contract, which is still up for grabs, with McDonnell Douglas on board, he speculated. That could mean more work for St. Louis.
""It's an opportunity and a threat to the St. Louis economy,"" he said.
Condit, who will become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company, said final merger negotiations began Tuesday, the day after he was elected to become Boeing's chairman effective Feb. 1.
While Boeing does not currently need additional capacity to produce commercial jets, it will benefit from additional engineering strength, which will allow it to produce new models or variations of existing jets more quickly.
The merger will leave Airbus Industrie as the only other major player in the business of making large commercial aircraft. An Airbus spokesman said McDonnell Douglas has not been a competitor in the civilian aircraft business for a number of years ""so it hasn't altered the equation in the commercial field at all for Airbus.""
Analysts predicted the deal would win clearance from federal antitrust regulators, noting that no protests were raised this month when the two companies struck a deal to work together on engineering new wide-body jets.
They thought the deal would win approval from the Pentagon, which has encouraged industry consolidation and backed the deal that created No. 1 defense contractor Lockheed Martin in 1994.
Perhaps the chief concern for federal regulators will be Boeing's overwhelming size, which will be nearly twice that of its nearest rival Lockeheed Martin.
Major U.S. airlines said it was too soon to forecast the impact of the proposed merger on airliner prices or their airplane-buying strategies. ""It is too early to tell,"" Delta Air Lines Inc spokesman Todd Clay said.",0
"A bankruptcy judge Monday cleared the way for Montana construction mogul Dennis Washington to take over storied engineering giant Morrison Knudsen Corp., rescuing the company from near-insolvency.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh, in Wilmington, Dela., approved the prepackaged reorganization plan under which Washington's main operating company will acquire the much-larger Morrison Knudsen for about $283 million in cash, stock and debt assumption.
Washington, 61, a billionaire through his interests in bridge and highway building, copper mining and shipping, will become non-executive chairman of the Boise, Idaho-based company when its merger with Washington Construction Group Inc. becomes effective Sept. 11.
Robert Tinstman, a company veteran appointed to be president and chief executive officer last year after the ouster of its high-flying former chairman, William Agee, will retain those titles in the new company.
The merger requires approval of Washington Construction Group shareholders, but that is a formality because Washington owns 68.5 percent of the shares.
The merged company will retain the Morrison Knudsen name and its Boise heaquarters, but shareholders of the old company -- known for such projects as the Hoover Dam and Alaskan oil pipeline -- will be left with little value.
A distribution of stock in the new company was valued by one analyst at about 15 cents a share, compared with nearly $30 before revelations of losses that stunned Wall Street and led to the ouster of Agee, whose lavish lifestyle had made him a lightning-rod for criticism.
""From a shareholder's point of view it's a pretty bad outcome,"" said the analyst, John Rogers of Jensen Securities.
Shareholders also get warrants to purchase additional shares in the new company at $12 a share, compared with Washington Construction's current price of $9.25. Bondholders will get from 93 to 95 percent of the $365 million they were owed, one banker said.
Executives say the new company will be profitable from the outset, with revenues estimated at $1.59 billion and net income at $31 million for its first full fiscal year beginning Dec. 1, according to bankruptcy court documents.
That compares with revenue of $2.72 billion and net income of $36 million in 1993, before the company reported losses that totalled more than $600 million over two years.
Analysts traced Morrison Knudsen's woes to a disastrous forway into railroads, including huge losses on bids to build new commuter transit cars, a business the company has exited.
Agee's ambitious plan to build new locomotives from the ground up never materialised, and its minority stake in MK Rail Corp. is being distributed to bondholders.
Agee himself, who once used a corporate jet to shuttle between Boise and his company-bought estate in Pebble Beach, Calif., was forced to give up some of his lucrative pension and severance benefits in a $63 million company settlement of class-action shareholder lawsuits.
The new Morrison will get about 90 percent of its revenues from three businesses -- industrial construction for Fortune 100 companies, heavy civil construction, and environmental remediation, mainly for government agencies, Tinstman said in an interview.
""Dennis very much wants this to be a well-balanced, diversified company,"" Tinstman said.
The remaining 10 percent of the company's business is mining.
Washington, who usually stays behind the scenes at his companies, will help set strategy at the new Morrison Knudsen but will not have a day-to-day role, Tinstman said.
Morrison Knudsen Chairman Robert Miller, who was brought in last year and is best known for helping to engineer Chrysler Corp.'s turnaround in the 1980s, will be vice chairman of the new company. The other vice chairman will be Washington aide Dorn Parkinson.",0
"Microsoft Corp Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown Monday said he expected the company's revenues to rise sequentially in the next two quarters from the $2.3 billion reported for the three months ended September 30.
In an interview, Brown also said he thought the company's cost of goods sold could decline ""a little bit"" in the long term from the 10.9 percent of revenue just reported, already down from 16 percent a year ago.  
""We'll grow a little bit in December and then a little bit more in March, I think,"" Brown said. ""I'm very happy with the general revenue trend, and I was very pleased with the pattern of costs in the quarter.""
Brown said revenue in the December quarter would be driven in part by holiday season cyclicality, while the March quarter would get a boost from the release of the company's Office 97 suite of business applications, an upgrade to one of the software company's core products.  
Brown said cost ratios were falling because of increased use of CD-ROMs for distributing software, rather than more costly diskettes, and because of the growing popularity of enterprise software licenses over sales through the retail and reseller channels.
Brown also said the company's spending on research and development was ""right on target,"" with its announced plans to spend $2.1 billion in the current fiscal year ending June 30.
In addition, he said unearned revenue on the company's balance sheet -- up to $651 million as of September 30 from $560 million three months earlier -- would rise further as a result of growth in the ""subscription"" model of sales, such as licenses and upgrade.",0
"American Airlines is planning to place a long-awaited order for about $6 billion worth of Boeing Co. airplanes, according to reports published Wednesday.
Airline Chairman Robert Crandall was scheduled to make a ""major company announcement"" at a news conference Thursday.
Officials of Boeing and American declined to comment on the order, reported in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, although an airline spokesman confirmed that directors of its parent company, AMR Corp., were meeting.
According to the reports, American will announce an order for more than 100 new Boeing jets, including 12 wide-body 777s and 75 narrow-body 737s.
Although American officials have said privately they have chosen Boeing for their fleet modernization program, the exact size of the initial order has not been revealed.
The orders are expected to be contingent on ratification by pilots of a new six-year contract, which could be put to a vote next month. The board of the pilots union was voting Wednesday on a tentative labor pact reached in September.
Industry analysts saw the order as a signal American could order hundreds of Boeing jets over the next two decades as it updates and expands its fleet, now a mix of planes built by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp., Airbus Industrie and Fokker NV.
""I think basically this is a commitment to the Boeing family,"" analyst Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities said.
""If you look at their fleet, they (American) have kind of a hodgepodge of things,"" he said. ""I think you can make the case that most of the airplanes they will be buying in the future will be these Boeing models.""
American currently does not operate the 737, which seats from 108 to 189 passengers and initially will be used to replace the 75 older 727 jets used by the airline.
But analysts said that over the next decade American likely will buy more 737s to replace its fleet of 260 aging McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.
American already has announced plans to sell most of its wide-body MD-11 jets to Federal Express Corp. for use as cargo jets, and analysts said Boeing's 777 would be a likely replacement choice suitable for the carrier's potential expansion in the Far East.
Analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research said American, the nation's No. 1 airline by revenue, appears to be turning over ""the whole fleet to Boeing aircraft.""
""It's a huge fleet,"" he said. ""Over the next decade there's going to be a lot more than $6 billion in planes delivered.""
For beleaguered McDonnell Douglas Corp., the decision would be yet another blow for a company that has acknowledged it will be only a niche player in the commercial aircraft market and last week was knocked out of contention for the Pentagon's biggest weapons program of the early 21st century, a jet fighter.
Analysts said they still expect a big fleet-renewal order from No. 3 carrier Delta Air Lines Inc., which could go at least partly to McDonnell Douglas.
""Somewhere along the line this is going to bubble over in McDonell Douglas' favor,"" Nisbet said.
Other major U.S. carriers already have announced their intentions to buy new airplanes now that the industry has returned to financial health after a long downturn.
Earlier this month, USAir Group Inc. chose Europe's Airbus Industrie to supply it with narrow-body jets in an order that could be worth $18 billion over the next 13 years. The carrier is negotiating with Boeing and Airbus for new wide-body jets.
Boeing stock rose $2.375 to $96.375 Wednesday and AMR stock was off 62.5 cents at $91, both on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Boeing Co.'s stunning agreement to acquire longtime rival McDonnell Douglas Corp. won a ringing endorsement from Wall Street and sent shock waves through the aerospace industry Monday.
Stock in both companies soared on expectations the deal would boost Boeing's operating profits immediately after its completion, targeted for mid-1997.
Boeing rose $4.375 to $101.125 and McDonnell Douglas jumped $10.375 to $62.375, down from earlier highs on the New York Stock Exchange but good enough to give the all-stock transaction an indicated value of nearly $14 billion.
Industry analysts saw few obstacles to the deal, which marks a startling transformation for a company that just a year ago was completing a final round of cutbacks that had slashed its work force by 30 percent in five years.
Since then Boeing has completed the $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp.'s defense and space business, won the right to compete for the richest military contract in Pentagon history and announced orders for a record $45.6 billion in new commercial jets.
""It's an incredible turnaround story,"" said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners, which specializes in aerospace. ""These are very bold, dramatic, uncharacteristic moves for Boeing and I applaud them for it.""
While Boeing had been moving to cut costs and transform its management style under outgoing Chairman Frank Shrontz, the pace has accelerated at the once-sluggish company since Phil Condit was named chief executive officer in April.
Condit began the final round of merger negotiations with McDonnell Douglas last Tuesday, just a day after being formally elected Boeing chairman as of Feb. 1, 1997.
""We're seeing Boeing evolve from kind of a stodgy company to being very aggressive, nimble,"" said Bill Whitlow, a longtime Boeing analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who praised Condit's energy and stamina.
Executives at the two companies said the deal would be additive to operating profits immediately and reiterated their prediction that Boeing could achieve $1 billion in annual savings without any layoffs because of rapid growth.
Analysts said the merger was a good strategy for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced plans to pull back from commercial aviation when it was eliminated from bidding for the Pentagon's 21st century joint strike fighter.
But Harry Stonecipher, chief executive of McDonnell Douglas, denied that the merger was born of desperation.
""This is the deal we wanted and we are very happy with it,"" Stonecipher told CNBC. ""This is the only deal we considered.""
Boeing executives told analysts they had no immediate plans to make further acquisitions, even though the combined company will generate cash flow of more than $4 billion a year on projected 1997 revenue of $48 billion.
The surprise merger immediately turned up the heat on Europe's Airbus Industrie to move ahead quickly with a restructuring plan. Without such a plan, the consortium would be unable to go ahead with a proposed super-jumbo aircraft to compete with Boeing's 747, which now is unchallenged at the profitable top end of the market, analysts said.
""Airbus Industrie and its partners must agree as soon as possible on an optimal structure that will allow Airbus Industrie to match its American competitors as a powerful, integrated European enterprise,"" German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in a statement.
Analysts noted that Boeing had ended any chance that Airbus would partner with McDonnell on a new large jet, and some said Boeing's own plans to stretch the 747 might now be deferred.
But both Airbus and Boeing could benefit from stabilized airplane prices with the No. 3 player out of the market.
Despite some overlapping businesses, including helicopters, rockets and missiles, experts saw little possibility the deal would be stopped by the Defense Department, although the combination of the nation's only manufacturers of commercial jets could give pause to federal antitrust regulators.
""It will be interesting to see what the airlines have to say about this,"" said Don Baker, a former antitrust official now with the firm Baker and Miller in Washington.
""It's worth remembering that there would be just two players in the worldwide market for big planes,"" he said. ""But maybe two is enough competition for the airlines.""
On the defense side, analysts said they expected the marriage of Boeing and McDonnell to spur further consolidation, with players such as Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp. looking for partners.
Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said the deal gives Raytheon, which supplies missile systems, ""a window of opportunity"" to buy Hughes Electronics Corp..
""It's not a long-term window,"" he said. ""It will probably last until the (Boeing-McDonnell) deal is closed.""",0
"An outbreak of bacterial food poisoning that sickened at least 13 children and young adults in the Seattle area has been traced to one company's tainted apple juice, health officials said on Wednesday.
Odwalla Inc, a rapidly growing fresh juice and beverage company based in Half Moon Bay, California, issued a nationwide recall of products containing fresh apple juice, and many retailers pulled all Odwalla beverages from their shelves.
State and county health officials said 10 of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli food poisoning had been conclusively traced to the unpasteurized Odwalla juice and the remaining three were under investigation.
At least eight more suspected cases have been reported, Dr. Mimi Fields, the state's deputy health secretary, said.
""It's difficult to know where we are on the epidenmic curve, although I don't think we are going to see a large influx of masses of new cases,"" Fields told Reuters.
The outbreak was the state's worst since some 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died in 1993 after eating undercooked hamburgers.
While adults may suffer diarrhea, stomach cramps or more mild, flulike symptoms after eating food tainted by the bacterium, young children are more susceptible to the disease and may suffer sudden kidney failure that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
In the current outbreak, six children have been hospitalized, including two who required dialysis. Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.
The strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or fertilizer that includes steer manure.
Health officials said juice can be tainted when fruit falls onto fertilized ground and is not washed properly.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has launched an investigation and will be inspecting Odwalla's plant in Dinuba, California, health officials said.
""Our first concern is for the health and safety of those affected,"" Odwalla chief executive officer Stephen Williamson said in a statement. He said the company was cooperating fully with health authorities.
Although so far all the cases have been traced to Odwalla juice, authorities recommended that consumers in the Seattle area boil unpasteurized apple juice or cider for 10 seconds before drinking it until the investigation was complete.
Odwalla, which bills itself as the ""leading branded fresh juice and beverage company,"" distributes its beverages in pint plastic bottles to supermarkets and retail outlets in Washington, Oregon, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and British Columbia.
In the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, the company reported its sales rose 65 percent to $59.2 million from $35.9 million. But net income fell to $633,000, or 12 cents a share, from $997,000, or 22 cents a share.",0
"Pyramid Breweries Inc.  PMIDO Tuesday warned of lower-than-expected sales and earnings for the fourth quarter, blaming increasing competition in the craft beer industry.
Seattle-based Pyramid said sales would be 20 percent to 25 percent below last year's levels on a wholesale basis and said it expected to just break even for the quarter, compared with analysts' projections it would earn 9 cents a share.
In last year's fourth quarter, the company posted gross sales of $7 million and net income of about $1 million, or 13 cents a share.
Pyramid's warning was the latest to roil the trendy craft beer industry, which has disappointed investors who snapped up stock sold in a spree of offerings over the past two years.
Pyramid stock, which went public at $19 as Hart Brewing Co. in December 1995, fell 12.5 cents after the announcement to $4.125 a share in Nasdaq trading. It ended an abbreviated trading session 25 cents lower at $4.
Pyramid's crosstown rival, Redhook Ale Brewery Inc. , which just last week warned of weak sales, was trading at $10.625 on Nasdaq, compared with its August 1995 offering price of $17 a share and a peak of $35.
Boston Beer Co., maker of Samuel Adams beer, was trading at $10 on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with an offering price of $20 little more than a year ago and a peak of $33.
Brewers have blamed tough competition, particularly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, where the premium-priced beers have caught on most quickly with consumers.
But market share for craft beers may have peaked in many of those initial markets, while an increasing number of varieties crowd grocery store coolers.
""Not a lot of new consumers are trying craft beers any more,"" said analyst Diane Daggatt of Dain Bosworth, referring to more mature markets. ""The people who are going to try them have tried them. They just haven't built any brand loyalty.""
She said about 400 craft brewers nationwide were distributing beer, up from 300 just a year ago. And brewers are adding more specialty beers, increasing competition and confusing consumers.
While breweries have been offering promotional discounts, analyst Scott McAdams of brokerage Ragen MacKenzie said the industry may be ripe for more serious price cuts and consolidation.
""People are going to have to think about addressing the price issue and spending more on marketing,"" he said. ""They're going to have to play the beer game more than they have been playing the beer game.""
But analysts said there was still a lot of room for growth in new markets. Nationally, craft beers account for about 3 percent of sales, compared with 8 percent to 10 percent in markets such as Portland and Seattle, she said.",0
"Boeing Co. is expected to use the biennial Farnborough Air Show in England next week to formally launch the long-awaited stretch version of its 747 jumbo jet, industry analysts say.
While officials of the aerospace giant remain tight-lipped, analysts say it is all but certain executives will make a major announcement on Monday regarding two new members of the 747 family that will be known as the 747-500 and 747-600.
""They're going to announce the airplanes -- there is no doubt,"" said Joe Campbell, an analyst at Lehman Bros.
He said the only question was whether Boeing would announce massive orders of $10 billion or more from launch customers or merely disclose that its board of directors had given authorization to offer the jet.
The announcement of the new models, which would include a jet with 30 percent more capacity than today's largest commercial airliner, is expected to be the highlight of the air show, frequently the stage for major order announcements and other industry news.
Boeing officials have said they are talking with at least six airlines about the potential new versions of the jumbo jet, including British Airways Plc, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
Boeing President Phil Condit said the company's board of directors discussed the new plane at a regularly scheduled meeting Monday but had not made a decision on whether to launch it.
""That will depend on airline orders,"" he said in a brief interview Tuesday.
Specifications being circulated within the industry call for the 747-600 to hold 548 passengers in a typical three-class configuration with a range of up to 8,900 miles (14,300 km), compared with 416 passengers and 8,400 miles (13,500 km) for the current-generation 747-400.
The long-range 747-500 would hold 462 passengers in three classes and have a range of up to 10,000 miles (16,000 km).
Analysts say the 747 stretch is essential for Boeing to continue dominating the lucrative top end of the market -- which it has had to itself since the introduction of the four-engine jumbo jet in 1970, which nearly bankrupted the company.
Now Boeing's own new 777 twin-engine jet is replacing older 747s, and possible new versions of jets from rivals Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas Corp. could threaten the lower end of the jumbo market.
""They really do need to be able to move up to again have a position of complete monopoly for the aircraft as they have had for a number of years,"" said analyst Paul Nisbet of JSA Research.
Meanwhile Airbus has signaled that it intends to go ahead with plans for its own all-new 550-seat plane, dubbed the 3XX, although analysts question whether the market for jumbo jets is big enough for two manufacturers.
""From an economic point of view, I don't think there's enough demand to justify the $10 (billion) to $15 billion cost"" of an all-new jet, said Bill Whitlow of Pacific Crest Securities.
He and other analysts said they expect air travel in the fast-growing Pacific region to follow the Atlantic in migrating to pairs of smaller cities rather than routes between world capitals that require the largest jets.
The trend toward such more thinly traveled routes was among the reasons cited by Boeing when it shelved a project to jointly develop with Airbus a double-decker airliner that would hold up to 800 passengers.
But Lehman's Campbell predicted Europe's Airbus, which is transforming itself from a consortium into a single company, would go ahead with its own jumbo jet for commercial delivery in 2003, about three years after Boeing's new 747 models.
""They're not going to leave Boeing alone at the upper end,"" he said.
Campbell estimated that Boeing's 747 revision, which would include a new wing, new engines and possible new cockpit electronics, would cost from $5 billion to $8 billion to develop.
Rolls-Royce Plc has said it plans to offer a variant of its Trent turbofan engine to power the new Boeing craft, while rivals General Electric Co. and United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit have formed a joint venture to develop an alternative power plant.",0
"Sierra Semiconductor Corp.'s stock jumped more than 27 percent Thursday on expectations the company will emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after it exits the computer modem business.
The San Jose, Calif.-based company's stock gained after its announcement Wednesday that it plans to pull out of the highly competitive modem-chip business and focus instead on the fast-growing market for computer networking equipment.
The stock rose $2.625 to $11.875 in late trading on NASDAQ.
""Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now, but it will be a more profitable business,"" said analyst Elias Moosa of Robertson Stephens & Co.
But analysts noted that Sierra still has much painful work ahead of it, including cutting as many as 150 jobs from its work force, which currently has 500 people, and building up the business of its PMC-Sierra unit, which makes routing devices and chipsets for high-speed computer networks.
The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of $50 million to $80 million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments.
Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modem-chip business.
""Once you announce your intention to exit a business, it becomes a complete buyer's market,"" he said.
He said that while the company is focusing on the fastest-growing part of its business, the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of much-larger players such as International Business Machines Corp
""As the market develops the question is, are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company?"" Randall said.
Other analysts were more bullish, even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales.
""It's a positive strategic move,"" said Miles Kan of Hambrecht & Quist. ""The modem business is a low-margin, commodity business,"" he said.
Sierra's PMC-Sierra unit generated $33 million of the company's $117 million in sales in the first half of the year, compared with $45 million in sales of modem chips, Kan said. But the PMC unit is far more profitable, he said.
Sierra's stock has fallen from a high of nearly $25 this year as the computer chip sector has been battered by falling prices and concern about slowing demand.",0
"Boeing Co's planned $13 billion acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. will propel it to a leading position as a military contractor, matching its stature as the world leader in commercial aviation.
While Europe's Airbus Industrie is likely to feel competitive pressure because of Boeing's increased resources, industry analysts said the chief benefits for Boeing would be on the military side.
""Historically Boeing's military business was something of an also-ran,"" said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""With this transaction in one fell swoop they become a very major player.""
One analyst said the combined company could get nearly 50 percent of its revenues from government contracts, up from Boeing's historical 25 to 30 percent.
The deal follows by little more than a week the completion of Boeing's $3.2 billion acquisition of Rockwell International Corp's defence and space business.
And it comes just a month after McDonnell Douglas was eliminated from consideration to build the military's 21st century joint strike fighter plane.
Instead the Pentagon chose Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp -- the nation's largest military contractor -- to build prototype versions of the new fighter jet in a contract that could be worth $200 billion or more to the eventual winner.
The addition of McDonnell Douglas' expertise makes Boeing ""the team to beat"" on the crucial programme, said Paul Nisbet of JSA Securities.
Analyst Nick Heymann of Natwest Securities said the loss of the joint strike fighter was the crowning blow for McDonnell Douglas, which already had announced its intention to back away from the commercial aviation market, where it has been only a marginal player in recent years.
""McDonnell Douglas just didn't have the resources to aggressively fund its development programmes,"" he said. ""They got stretched too thin on transports and fighters and commercial, and they underinvested.""
Nevertheless the friendly all-stock deal does not necessarily mean that McDonnell Douglas executives failed in their effort to turn around the company, analysts said.
For one thing the offer price of about $62.89 a share based on Friday's close is well beyond the stock's all-time high and about 10 times its level of the early 1990s, said Wolfgang Demisch of BT Securities.
In addition the merger is being done at the very beginning of an expansion cycle in the industry, meaning layoffs can be minimised and the companies have several years to rationalise their operations before the next expected downturn.
""It isn't a case that you're merging because you're starving to death,"" said Demisch. ""It's a case that there's lots of opportunity. ... That's a much healthier basis on which to consolidate.""
Indeed Boeing chief executive Phil Condit said the combined companies would have revenues of $48 billion next year, up more than 30 percent from a projected $35 billion this year.
""We are going to be going after $1 billion or more of savings a year, but we are going to be doing in it in an environment where the overall growth is occurring,"" Condit said at a news conference. ""That's the advantage we have got right now.""
Condit, who will become chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company, said final merger negotiations began Tuesday, the day after he was elected to become Boeing's chairman effective Feb. 1.
While Boeing does not currently need additional capacity to produce commercial jets, it will benefit from additional engineering strength, which will allow it to produce new models or variations of existing jets more quickly.
Analysts predicted the deal would win clearance from federal antitrust regulators, noting that no protests were raised this month when the two companies struck a deal to work together on engineering new wide-body jets.
And analysts said they thought the deal would win approval from the Pentagon, which has encouraged industry consolidation and backed the deal that created No. 1 defence contractor Lockheed Martin in 1994.
Perhaps the chief concern for federal regulators will be Boeing's overwhelming size, which will be nearly twice that of its nearest rival Lockeheed Martin if the deal goes through.",0

"Microsoft Corp. reported better-than-expected profits for the latest quarter Monday as strong demand for its Windows 95 and Windows NT computer operating systems helped fuel record sales.
The world's largest software maker said earnings rose 23 percent to a record $614 million, or 95 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter ended in September, from $499 million, or 78 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues jumped 14 percent to $2.30 billion from $2.02 billion.
The profits exceeded Wall Street's expectations of 90 cents a share, and shares of the software giant rose to $136.375 in after-hours trading from the earlier close of $134 on Nasdaq.
Microsoft cited strong acceptance of the company's high end Windows NT operating system.
""We shipped version 4.0 of Windows NT this quarter, and the momentum behind the product is outstanding,"" said Jeff Raikes, Group Vice President, Sales and Marketing.
""Corporate customers made the decision to adopt Windows NT servers and workstations in record numbers, driving 19 percent revenue growth over last quarter in the U.S. and Canada. Sales of Windows NT server grew at nearly double the rate of other operating system environments.""
Microsoft's results were considered a crucial measure of its progress since the year-ago period included the launch of the company's much-hyped Windows 95 operating system.
Industry analysts have said Microsoft's sales and earnings growth would slow from last year's blistering pace of more than 46 percent but noted it should continue to benefit from higher sales of personal computers and the growing use of Windows 95 and Windows NT.
Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said he expected revenues to rise sequentially over the next two quarters from the $2.3 billion reported for the quarter ended on Sept. 30.
In an interview, Brown also said he thought the company's cost of goods sold could decline ""a little bit"" in the long term from the 10.9 percent of revenues just reported, already down from 16 percent a year ago.
""We'll grow a little bit in December and then a little bit more in March, I think,"" Brown said. ""I'm very happy with the general revenue trend, and I was very pleased with the pattern of costs in the quarter.""
Brown said revenues in the December quarter would be driven in part by holiday season sales, while the next quarter would get a boost from the release of the company's Office 97 business applications upgrade to one of its core products.",0

"An outbreak of bacterial food poisoning that sickened at least 13 children and young adults in the Seattle area has been traced to one company's tainted apple juice, health officials said on Wednesday.
Odwalla Inc, a rapidly growing fresh juice and beverage company based in Half Moon Bay, California, issued a nationwide recall of products containing fresh apple juice, and many retailers pulled all Odwalla beverages from their shelves.
State and county health officials said 10 of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli food poisoning had been conclusively traced to the unpasteurized Odwalla juice and the remaining three were under investigation.
At least eight more suspected cases have been reported, Dr. Mimi Fields, the state's deputy health secretary, said.
""It's difficult to know where we are on the epidenmic curve, although I don't think we are going to see a large influx of masses of new cases,"" Fields told Reuters.
The outbreak was the state's worst since some 500 people became ill in the Seattle area and three children died in 1993 after eating undercooked hamburgers.
While adults may suffer diarrhea, stomach cramps or more mild, flulike symptoms after eating food tainted by the bacterium, young children are more susceptible to the disease and may suffer sudden kidney failure that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
In the current outbreak, six children have been hospitalized, including two who required dialysis. Officials said all the children had been released except for one 2-year-old boy, who was in satisfactory condition.
The strain of E. coli implicated in the outbreak normally lives in the digestion system of cattle and can spread into the food chain through slaughterhouse contamination or   fertilizer

"Microsoft Corp Chief Financial Officer Mike Brown said he expected earnings and revenues to rise sequentially in the fiscal third and fourth quarters compared with the just-ended second quarter.
Brown said in an interview he expects the recent release of Office 97 to provide a ""nice step"" up in earnings in the third quarter from the $0.57 a share reported for the second quarter, and he sees a ""small sequential step up"" in the fourth quarter.
Brown also said he expected revenues and earnings growth in the 20 percent range for fiscal 1998 beginning July 1, 1997.  
""It doesn't seem wise to get beyond that with data we have today,"" he said.
Brown said he was pleased with the record results of the just-ended second quarter, which he said was strong ""across the board.""
But he said the company thought it was prudent to issue a warning about slower growth in fiscal 1998, when Microsoft will not enjoy the benefit of major revenue-enhancing upgrades such as Windows 95 last year and Office 97 this year.  
While the company does have an opportunity to boost its OEM revenue with the increasing penetration of the high-end Windows NT operating system, which generates more revenue per unit than Windows 95, Brown said he expected that to be more significant in fiscal 1999.
""It's just a good time to be a little bit realistic about '98,"" he said.
Brown said he expected research and development spending to continue to grow faster than revenues in fiscal 1998, although he declined to be specific. He noted that the company's R&D spending now exceeds an annual rate of $2 billion, and he expected that to exceed $3 billion ""at some point"" in the future, putting pressure on profit margins.
He said while the company has reduced its cost of goods sold this year, it is unlikely to be able to reduce them much further next year.
But he said the company could continue to reduce its sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues.",0
"A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a jury verdict that ordered Nintendo Co. Ltd. to pay $253 million for patent infringement.
With interest, the company could have been forced to pay nearly $300 million to tiny Alpex Computer Corp. for a technology allegedly used in the hugely popular Nintendo Entertainment System game device, Nintendo of America Chairman Howard Lincoln said in an interview.
But in a 16-page decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., overturned the jury's decision that the Alpex patent had been infringed.
""It's a complete victory,"" Lincoln said. ""I think our nightmare with these folks is over.""
Alpex, which Lincoln described as a bankrupt mining concern, filed suit in 1986, charging Nintendo's 8-bit game device used a patented ""bitmapping"" display technology patented by two Alpex engineers in 1977.
In 1994 a U.S. District Court jury agreed and ordered Nintendo to pay a 6 percent royalty on each of the more than 35 million game units sold in the United States.
But a three-judge panel of the appeals court in Washington, which handles patent cases, said in a 16-page decision it found a ""lack of substantial evidence to support a finding of infringement either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.""
Alpex's technology was used in early generation video games made by Mattel, Atari and Coleco. The company later won patent infringement settlements from Sega Enterprises Ltd. and others.
But with the appeal victory Nintendo preserved what Lincoln said was a perfect record of fighting in court to protect its intellectual property rights.
Lincoln said the case ""cries out for a change"" in the patent litigation system because it required a jury of laymen to sit through an eight-week trial that hinged on complex technical details of data storage and image display.
""The problem is you ask these juries to in effect become electrical engineers, and quite frankly the jury was not composed of electrical engineers,"" Lincoln said.
He also said the case was kept alive by lawyers working on a contingency-fee basis who stood to make huge profits.
While Alpex could appeal to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court, Lincoln said he was confident Nintendo would prevail.
Lawyers for Alpex could not be reached for comment.",0
"Louisiana-Pacific Corp. said Monday it will close its Ketchikan pulp mill in southeastern Alaska next year after the failure of negotiations with the Clinton administration over timber supply.
The company said it planned to take a $350 million charge against third-quarter pre-tax earnings -- $215 million or $2 per share after taxes -- to reflect shutdown of the pulp mill and nine smaller plants nationwide as well as settlement of a shareholder lawsuit.
The closing of the controversial 48-year-old pulp plant, which had been expected, will idle about 500 workers in Ketchikan, a city of 15,000 in the heart of the sprawling Tongass National Forest where the mill has long been the biggest employer.
Company executives said the mill would close March 24, 1997, after the existing supply of timber is processed.
Under an agreement worked out by the White House and Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski, Louisiana-Pacific said it expected to get enough timber to continue operating two sawmills in the region for two more years, employing 400 to 500 workers.
Portland, Ore.-based Louisiana-Pacific blamed the closure of the pulp mill, which lost an estimated $40 million in the first nine months of the year, on ""the Clinton administration's opposition to any compromise that would allow the pulp mill to operate profitably.""
In a conference call with reporters, Louisiana-Pacific Chairman Mark Suwyn spoke of forces outside Alaska who wanted to reverse years of development in the state.
""There clearly is a push by many people who have a significant amount of power to shut down all of Alaska, and I am assuming they're going to turn it into some great big national park whereby only tourists can visit,"" he said.
Environmentalists called Suwyn's charge an exaggeration and said they were satisfied by the closure of a mill they claim has benefited from ""sweetheart"" federal timber contracts while causing significant air and water pollution.
Buck Lindekugel of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council called the mill closure a ""business decision to jettison a money-losing mill that can't compete in world pulp markets.""
But Suwyn blamed changes imposed by the U.S. Forest Service after passage of the 1990 Tongass Reform Act, aimed at protecting the 17-million-acre reserve of old-growth rainforest that sprawls over islands, mountains and glaciers.
Louisiana-Pacific has filed lawsuits in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, seeking $200 million for breach of contract, and will be filing ""significant additional claims in the very near future,"" Suwyn said.
He acknowledged what he called ""stupid"" environmental mistakes that resulted in Ketchikan Pulp Co.'s agreement last year to pay $6 million in civil and criminal penalties.
Louisiana-Pacific also said it planned to close or sell several plants that are no longer competitive or essential to its operations, including several structural panel plants being hurt by market overcapacity.
The company also said it has agreed to pay $65 million to settle shareholder lawsuits stemming from a drop in the company's stock price last year after revelations of civil and criminal actions.
Among them were class-action lawsuits over allegedly defective home siding developed by the company. Louisiana-Pacific agreed last year to pay up to $375 million to settle claims by homeowners in Florida, Oregon and Washington, among other states.
Suwyn said the shareholder lawsuits were the last major cloud over a company the he joined this year after the ouster of its longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Harry Merlo.
""We're simply trying to clean up all the things that are not going to contribute to moving this company forward,"" he said.",0
"China warned the United States on Thursday that slowly warming Sino-U.S. ties could be complicated if Washington decided to confront Beijing on the issue of human rights.
""If the human rights question is made into an issue to interfere in China's internal affairs, then this problem will become more and more complicated,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.
""The Chinese government cannot accept... using the human rights question to put pressure on the Chinese government or to interfere in China's internal affairs,"" Shen said.
Repeated clashes over human rights and issues ranging from Taiwan to copyright piracy sent Sino-U.S. relations into a tailspin in 1995 and 1996, and ties have only recently started to recover with a series of high-level official meetings.
Differences in U.S. and Chinese views towards human rights were normal and could be resolved through talks, Shen said.
""But if you are confrontational then the basis for dialogue will be lost,"" Shen said in response to a question about China's reaction to comments by U.S. Secretary of State-designate Madeleine Albright which slammed Beijing's human rights record.
Albright said at her Senate confirmation hearing in Washington on Wednesday that the United States could co-sponsor a resolution criticising China's human rights record and present it before the United Nations Human Rights Commission when it meets in Geneva early this year.
Last April, China succeeded in quashing a U.S.-backed draft resolution at the commission expressing concern over continuing reports of Chinese violations of fundamental freedoms.
The human rights situation in China had not improved much since the forwarding of last year's resolution, Albright said.
But she said Washington's focus towards Beijing would be on ""Chinese integration, not isolation"" and that she still supported the separation of human rights issues from trade.
In 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton delinked annual renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trade benefits from Beijing's human rights record, a move hailed by Beijing.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing last November but made little public mention of human rights, in contrast to his 1994 trip that ended in disaster because of wrangling over the issue.
Christopher pledged not to allow Sino-U.S. ties to be derailed by any single issue.
Clinton met his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in the Philippines last December, when the two leaders agreed to an exchange of state visits in 1997.
Washington has criticised Beijing for its imprisonment of political dissidents and for its heavy-handed rule in Tibet but China defends its human rights record by pointing to rising living standards and booming economic growth.
China jailed several prominent dissidents in 1996 as part of its obsession with stability coupled with the easing of foreign pressure on its human rights record, activists have said.
The official Xinhua news agency said meanwhile that China and the United States had agreed to hold another round of talks this month aimed at hammering out a new textile pact.
The bilateral pact had been scheduled to expire on December 31 last year but was extended until January 31 amid progress on renewing the 1994 accord. The talks will begin in Beijing on January 27.",0
"The Communist Party chief in Tibet has vowed to boost patriotic education in the Himalayan region to battle foreign forces hostile to China and the influence of the exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.
Patriotic education would be an important factor in battling hostile Western forces that sought to create chaos in Tibet, the Tibet Daily said in an edition seen in Beijing on Thursday.
""Unflaggingly carrying out patriotic education...and opposing the ideologicial infiltration of hostile Western forces and the Dalai Lama clique is an arduous and prominent task,"" the November 12 edition of the newspaper said, quoting party secretary Chen Kuiyuan.
Combatting the influence of Beijing's chief rival for Tibetan loyalties, the Dalai Lama, was a pressing task for the restive region, Chen said.
Chen accused Western media of spreading the Dalai Lama's plots to split Tibet from China.
""The struggle against 'westernisation' and 'splitting up' is present at every moment and will be present for a long time to come,"" he said.
Beijing suspects the West is playing the Tibet card to weaken, divide and contain China.
Ideological education was needed to fight religious thinking and separatist ideas that had penetrated Tibetan schools and threatened to gain control of the region's youth, Chen said.
""Teaching cadres, the masses and broad numbers of youth to passionately love the motherland and passionately love socialism is the primary task of ideological construction,"" Chen said.
Chen's speech appeared a day after the newspaper called for tighter controls on religion in Tibet and vowed to crack down on pro-independence monks and nuns.
The Dalai Lama, who fled his Himalayan homeland in 1959 after a failed uprising against communist rule, had draped himself in the cloak of religion to further his splittist aims, Chen said.
The Dalai Lama, widely revered in his homeland as a god-king, won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize for his non-violent struggle for autonomy for Tibet.
Chen said temples would be the battlefields in the fight against the Dalai Lama. He did not elaborate.
Beijing has repeatedly cracked down on monks and nuns in the deeply devout Buddhist region and accused the clergy of playing a major role in an underground Tibetan campaign against communist rule.
Tibet has been rocked by anti-Chinese protests by monks and nuns since the 1980s. Communist troops marched into Tibet in 1950.
The London-based watchdog group Tibet Information Network reported earlier this week that a jailed Tibetan nun had had her sentence doubled to 18 years for defying Beijing's choice of the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk.
The party boss also warned that superstitious beliefs had made a recent comeback in the region because the Dalai Lama had used religion to drug the people.
Ugly religious practices had appeared again in wedding and funeral ceremonies and other aspects of social life, Chen said.
Religion had even taken root among some government officials and threatened to hinder the economic development of the backward and remote region, Chen said.
""These negative ideas and actions block the spread of science and technology and hinder the development of productive forces,"" he said.",0
"China on Wednesday handed over to U.S. military officers the remains of U.S. airmen who died 52 years ago when their bomber crashed into a remote southwestern Chinese mountain during World War Two.
""No matter where we must go or how much time it takes, America does not forget its warriors and we will endeavour to bring each and every one home,"" said Alan Liotta, deputy director of the MIA/POW (Missing In Action/Prisoner of War) office under the Department of Defence.
A senior Chinese military officer handed over two wooden chests containing remains and a third filled with personal effects to uniformed U.S. officers in a brief ceremony in the southwestern Guangxi region.
Four U.S. soldiers in full military uniform took the boxes, exchanged salutes with the Chinese officer and placed a folded U.S. flag on each of the three boxes. A formal ceremony is to be held in Beijing on Friday.
""Fifty years ago these brave young men scattered their blood over this beautiful region,"" said Liang Ziwei, director of foreign affairs in the town of Xingan.
A six-man forensic team from the U.S. Department of Defence clawed its way up the steep, slippery face of Maoer mountain on Tuesday to inspect the crash site and found human remains and parts of an American bomber.
The officials said findings confirmed information about the fatal crash that occurred on August 31, 1944. The human remains would be taken back to the United States for identification.
Local residents searching for wild herbs discovered the crash site last October. The B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned from a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan.
""I like the idea... that even if it is 52 years later that we discovered the remains that we make the effort to bring them back and show the honour and respect they deserve,"" U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Phillips said after the ceremony.
People's Liberation Army Colonel Fu Jianping voiced China's gratitude for U.S. help in fighting Japan in World War Two.
""As a military man, I have a great respect for their spirit, especially the airmen who met with disaster here,"" he told Reuters.
U.S. officials first learned of the find when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Jiang revealed the find at a time when Sino-U.S. ties, which plunged early last year, were recovering significantly.
""This demonstrates a spirit of cooperation and a longing for future peace and renewed relationships,"" U.S. Major Mark Keene said after the ceremony.
Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian gave U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry two dogtags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington last month.
Journalists who made the trek to the site saw a pile of charred and twisted metal wedged into a narrow crevasse on the mountain side. Higher up the slope was a chunk of the plane's fuselage along with part of an engine, also wedged into rock.
U.S. officials said they had made contact with all 10 families of the crewmen aboard the plane. They said the site appeared to have been untouched for more than half a century.",0
"A decade ago, Chinese publishers were still putting type in place by hand, painstakingly selecting one character at a time from thousands of inky stereotypes.
Then in 1986, Wang Xuan, a professor of computer science at Beijing University, created a software programme to represent Chinese fonts on a computer.
Today, nearly all of China's newspapers are printed using Wang's Electronic Publishing System, a product of the Founder Group Corp that he helped the university launch.
""Our Chinese word processing software was far ahead of foreign products, that's why we took the leading market position at a stroke,"" Wang told Reuters in an interview.
From Founder's modest origins as a college department offshoot employing 20 workers, the firm now has 36 subsidiaries employing more than 1,000 people. It also has a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange.
Founder's net assets totalled HK$494.9 million at the end of 1995 and the company posted net profit of HK$109 million last year on sales turnover of HK$1.1 billion.
Wang, the 59-year-old chairman of what has perhaps become one of China's most successful computer companies, predicted the firm would continue its strong performance as the domestic market expands and it finds new opportunities abroad.
The company's net profit in the first six months of this year rose a year-on-year 7.0 percent to HK$55.8 million and turnover shot up 27 percent to HK$590 million.
""I can confidently say that we will see an increase in both turnover and profit in 1996,"" Wang said.
Founder is China's fourth biggest manufacturer of personal computers but Wang says he plans to focus his energies on the more interesting -- and lucrative -- software business.
""Selling personal computers is all about sales technique,"" Wang said. ""I get very excited about high-tech stuff, much more than business.""
Founder had snared 78 percent of China's publishing software market as of August, up from 70 percent at the end of 1995, Wang said.
The company also boasted clients among Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and North America, he said.
Founder's office automation products were gaining popularity among Chinese banks, government agencies and advertising firms, he said.
Wang has visited numerous companies abroad and said he was confident Founder would crack the Japanese market in two years and be a strong player in the international market within five years.
As part of Wang's drive to boost Founder's role overseas, the firm signed a pact last May to develop publishing solutions based on products and technology of U.S.-based Apple Computer Inc
Wang listed Founder in Hong Kong in December 1995. Beijing University still holds 56 percent of the company.
Initially offered at HK$1.98 a share, Founder's stock shot up to a high of HK$4.0 a share earlier this year though it has since fallen back. It ended at HK$3.15 on Friday.
Wang's market success has earned the slender, bespectacled entrepreneur comparisons at home to Microsoft's Bill Gates, a likeness Wang is happy to embrace.
But Wang insists similarities to the American software guru are limited.
""The difference is huge. Bill Gates is 40, I am almost 60. I am past my creative peak,"" Wang said.
The entrepreneur notes other differences.
Like many Chinese his age, Wang lived through the tumultuous early years after the communist revolution in 1949.
That included the disastrous Great Leap Forward  -- launched by Chairman Mao Zedong in the late 1950s to spur rapid development. Instead, it set China back for years and triggered famine that killed as many as 30 million people.
Wang was persecuted for listening to English radio broadcasts during the Cultural Revolution, a decade of political turmoil that began in 1966 to infuse the young communist state with renewed ideological vigour.
While the Microsoft mogul has amassed a personal fortune of billions of dollars, Wang receives a salary of about 10,000 yuan a month and holds no shares in the firm he heads.
""I'm easily satisfied,"" he said.

"A U.S. military honour guard on Friday formally took back the remains of U.S. airmen killed in World War Two and sent them on their final journey home.
Chinese officials handed over to U.S. Ambassador James Sasser three black cases containing the remains of the B-24 bomber's crew, who died when their plane hit a steep mountain slope in China's southwestern Guangxi region 52 years ago.
Under a crisp blue winter sky, uniformed men and women from the U.S. Army, Marine Corps and Navy placed the remains in three body-length aluminium cases and covered each with an American flag in a ceremony at Beijing's Capital Airport.
""This ceremony is dedicated to the American servicemen who made contributions and sacrificed their lives to resist fascist aggression,"" said Mei Ping, director of the North American and Oceanian Affairs Office of China's Foreign Ministry.
""The remains of these airmen will now be repatriated to their homeland where they can finally rest in peace,"" Mei said at the ceremony.
The oblong cases were loaded onto a U.S. C-141 Starlifter transport aircraft that was to fly the remains to the Department of Defence's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii for identification.
The remains represented more than one person but it was still unknown how many individuals they belonged to, said Alan Liotta of the MIA/POW (Missing in Action/Prisoner of War) Office under the Department of Defence.
Chinese and U.S. officials and soldiers saluted the dead airmen as a military dirge drifted across the airport tarmac.
U.S. officials said the mission to recover the remains was part of an ongoing effort by the U.S. and Chinese governments to provide a full accounting of American soldiers lost in regional conflicts.
""After 50 years, we have every reason, between the United States and China, to live in peace and work for peace, security and prosperity of mankind,"" Mei told reporters.
U.S. officials first learned of the find when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Jiang revealed the find at a time when both Washington and Beijing say ties are improving after plunging early last year.
Two local farmers discovered the wreckage of the aircraft last October after becoming lost while looking for wild herbs.
The B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned to its base in Guangxi after completing a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan on August 31, 1944.
A six-man forensic team from the Department of Defence that clawed its way up the steep, slippery face of Mao'er mountain on Tuesday to inspect the crash site found more human remains and parts of the bomber.

"China's defence sector and state-owned heavy industries are the country's biggest loss-makers but reform of the lumbering state sector is proceeding at a snail's pace, analysts said on Friday.
More than 45 percent of China's 68,800 state industrial firms posted losses from January to September, a rise of 17.6 percent from the same period last year, according to the latest data from the State Statistical Bureau.
""Those most in need of help would be the military industries and traditional industries,"" said Zheng Haihang, a professor of industrial economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Traditional industries included the coal and oil sectors as well as heavy industry, Zheng said by telephone.
""To put it simply, it's mostly these traditional industries, which have a very backward structure,"" Zheng said of the state sector's mounting losses.
Many of China's state-run enterprises are overstaffed and unable to compete in domestic or overseas markets. They also carry the heavy burden of providing cradle-to-grave welfare services for their employees.
The combined losses of state firms reached 65.12 billion yuan ($7.8 billion) during the first nine months of the year, a rise of 45.7 percent from a year ago, official figures show.
Compounding the problem is interest on unpaid debts -- a substantial burden even after two interest rate cuts this year.
""The debt burden of state-owned enterprises is very heavy, so of course this affects their profitability,"" Zheng said.
The January-September net profits of China's state industries fell to 11.28 billion yuan, down 75.8 percent from the same period last year, the statistics show.
Reform of defence industries -- many based in remote and backward inland regions and fitted with ageing technology -- had proceeded slowly, the economist said.
""Military industries are trying to transform into civilian industries, but the transition is extremely difficult -- there's no capital,"" he said.
Officials have said more than 200 state firms have been declared insolvent to date but Beijing has been wary of pushing ahead with bankruptcies.
Beijing fears that reform of state enterprises will lead to mass unemployment and eventually spark social unrest, said one Western analyst reached by telephone.
""That's one major reason why reform is going so slowly,"" said the analyst, who declined to be identified.
China's trade unions had set up a special fund this year to help workers in ailing state firms, the China Daily newspaper said on Friday.
""The relief fund...is designed to help employees from money-losing state-owned enterprises maintain decent living standards,"" the newspaper said.
Unions had raised 1.2 billion yuan so far this year to help about seven million impoverished workers in state enterprises and disaster-stricken areas, it said.

"This month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit could see conflicting views between regional powers eager to boost free trade and a Chinese delegation more interested in soft loans, diplomats said.
While Pacific heavyweights such as the United States, Japan and Canada aimed to lower trade barriers between the region's markets, China was hoping to squeeze easy credit out of richer APEC members at the summit in the Philippines, they said.
""There's a fundamental tension between China on the one hand and most other APEC states on the other,"" said a Western diplomat in Beijing.
""Should (APEC) be directed toward the trade-investment liberalisation framework or should it be directed toward economic and technical cooperation?"" asked the diplomat.
Analysts say the Subic summit would also give Chinese president Jiang Zemin a key opportunity to put his personal seal on a recent upturn in cross-Pacific ties at the first Sino-U.S. presidential meeting since 1995.
While the forum would provide the Chinese delegation with a welcome venue for private talks with the United States -- and possibly rival Taiwan -- Beijing would be less keen on the summit's avowed free trade agenda, the diplomats said.
China feared throwing open its doors to foreign competitors could devastate China's struggling state sector, raising the spectre of social unrest, the Western diplomat said.
""There is a fundamental contradiction between the imperatives of China's domestic situation and the free trade agenda,"" he said.
Access to its potentially vast markets would be the juicy carrot China dangled in front of other APEC members in exchange for promises of soft loans and technical assistance, he said.
""China... is hinting that APEC members should make a 'down payment'... on economic and technical cooperation, i.e. fork out some money,"" he said.
Beijing could be looking for the creation of a special APEC fund to assist the region's developing countries, he said.
The economic summit would also provide China's Jiang with a rare chance to rub shoulders with other world leaders and to boost the recent warming in Sino-U.S. ties long battered by disputes over trade, human rights and arms proliferation.
""The Chinese like to talk about the 'APEC style'...you shelve sensitive agendas and sensitive questions and you talk about them behind closed doors,"" the diplomat said.
Beijing could also use the meeting to quietly resume talks with its island arch-foe Taiwan, he said.
""It's an ideal opportunity for them to get together in circumstances where they've got a fairly good chance of...keeping news of it hush-hush,"" he said.
Other analysts said there was little chance of backroom talks between Beijing and Taipei officials because China was unlikely to soften its stance towards the island, which it has viewed as a rebel province since the end of civil war in 1949.
""I don't expect any breakthrough in Taiwan-China relations at the APEC meeting because the two sides set their own conditions, and very different ones, for resuming talks,"" said Chiu Chao-ling, a research fellow at Taiwan's Academia Sinica.
While other APEC members send heads of state to attend the forum, Taiwan, at the insistence of Beijing, has been allowed to send only low-ranking officials to lead its delegation.
Taipei wanted to crack open its diplomatic isolation at this year's summit by sending President Lee Teng-hui or vice-president Lien Chan, but host Manila rejected the move.
""It looks like Taiwan puts too much focus on its APEC representative, but not on what it can do as an APEC member,"" said Taiwan's Chiu. ""We should play a more active role instead of asking only who can go to the meeting.""",0
"U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis has begun talks with Chinese officials in Beijing on arms proliferation issues, a U.S. Embassy official said on Monday.
""She has arrived and started talks,"" the official said by telephone. Davis arrived in Beijing last Thursday and was due to hold talks on Monday and Tuesday.
""She is the undersecretary for arms control issues... She has a whole range of issues that she'll be bringing up with the Chinese,"" the official said when asked what Davis would discuss with her hosts.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn flew into Beijing last week for talks before Davis's visit.
John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, also visited the Chinese capital recently.
Officials have said Davis would discuss how the two countries might implement a decade-old, peaceful nuclear cooperation accord that would let U.S. firms sell nuclear power reactors to China.
Beijing has tried to lure foreign technology, some of it with potential military value, with promises of lucrative business contracts.
China's official Xinhua news agency said on Monday that U.S. firms stood to win billions of dollars of nuclear energy contracts if the 1985 agreement were put into effect.
""Sino-U.S. cooperation in nuclear energy development has yet to enter a substantial stage,"" Xinhua quoted Li Donghui as saying.
""Negotiations on the agreement are still under way,"" added Li, the deputy-general director of the China National Nuclear Corp's international cooperation bureau.
The pact has not been implemented because of Washington's concern that Beijing has sold nuclear technology to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in other nations, most notably to Pakistan.
Both China and Pakistan deny the charges.
China agreed last May not to provide aid such as ring magnets and other devices used in making nuclear weapons to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities.
U.S. officials say a reported nuclear-related deal between Beijing and Islamabad was struck before the May accord was drawn up and that they have no evidence China has violated the pact.
Davis would also renew U.S. concerns over Chinese sales of conventional arms to Iran, who Washington has blacklisted as a sponsor of terrorism, officials have said.
Washington is investigating reports that Indonesia and China are close to a deal to sell Iran five French helicopters that could be armed with air-launched missiles.
Davis's talks were expected to pave the way for a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher later this month, his first to China in two years.
Christopher's 1994 visit ended in bitter wrangling over human rights issues.
Sino-U.S. relations have been battered in recent months by disputes over human rights, China's rampant copyright abuse and Beijing's terms of entry into the World Trade Organisation.
The White House said last week it was deeply concerned over a Chinese court verdict sentencing prominent pro-democracy activist Wang Dan to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.",0
"China said on Wednesday it would empower Hong Kong's courts to put on trial off-duty Chinese soldiers after Beijing resumes control over the British colony in 1997.
The standing committee of the National People's Congress (parliament), which is in session in Beijing, was expected to pass a law spelling out how to handle criminal or civil cases involving troops to be garrisoned in Hong Kong, the official Xinhua news agency said.
""Crimes committed by off-duty personnel... will be handled by the courts of the Hong Kong SAR (Special Adminstrative Region),"" the agency said.
Criminal cases involving on-duty soldiers would be handled by military courts, it said.
Civil rights offences committed by off-duty members of the Chinese garrison, which will be responsible for Hong Kong's security after the colony returns to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, would be dealt with by Hong Kong courts, it said.
Civil rights offences committed by soldiers while on duty would be referred to China's Supreme People's Court, the nation's highest judicial body, it said.
Chinese lawmakers had used British army practices in Hong Kong as a reference in drafting the measures, Xinhua quoted Fu Quanyou, general chief of staff of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), as saying.
Defence operations of the PLA would not be subject to Hong Kong courts, Xinhua said but did not elaborate.
""Troops stationed in Hong Kong will notify the Hong Kong SAR government in advance of any military drills and exercises to be conducted that involve the public interest,"" it said.

"China is singing the praises of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in a primetime television series but the paean to the ageing patriarch is getting mixed reviews from the man in the street.
Beijing residents viewed the first few episodes of the 12-part documentary on the 92-year-old leader with a mixture of adulation, scepticism and indifference.
""I think it's great. I've seen all of the episodes so far and I'm going to watch the rest, too,"" said a 35-year-old journalist on Sunday.
""Deng should be honoured for China's economic development,"" he told Reuters. ""The show is just great.""
Deng, whose pragmatic policies helped transform China from a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse, has not been seen in public in nearly two years. In his last appearance he looked frail and faltering.
Speculation abounds about his health, ranging from rumours he was admitted to hospital in recent days to reports he remains at home with little change in health but with fading lucidity.
But he has been lionised in the television series.
Analysts have said the documentary would help define Deng's legacy to the current party leadership and set the tone for a crucial Communist Party congress due later this year.
Saturday's episode dealt with the period just after the 1949 Communist revolution and strove to show how Deng began forming his market-oriented economic policies.
While the television series has so far avoided measuring Deng's more open policies against the disastrous radicalism of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, the contrast was not lost on some viewers.
""Mao liberated the country but he made mistakes like the Cultural Revolution,"" said the journalist in a reference to the decade of ultra-leftism that Mao inspired in 1966.
Some viewers said the programme was carefully crafted by China's propaganda tsars and may not have given the whole story.
""Of course they have to censor a few things,"" said one 27-year-old musician who declined to be identified.
The series has not mentioned Deng's second wife who left him for another Communist official in 1932 when he fell from political grace for the first of three times in his long career.
But many people said they had not watched any of the episodes, while others who saw it were less than enthusiastic.
""I saw some of it but there were too many commercials,"" said a middle-aged woman who was selling peanuts and sunflower seeds at a roadside market.
A soldier who was sweeping snow from a Beijing street, asked for his thoughts on the man responsible for China's opening up to the outside world, said; ""I don't know anything about that. And why do you ask?""",0
"A U.S. defence team found human remains and parts of an American bomber on Tuesday after making its way up a steep mountain slope in southwestern China to inspect a recently found World War Two crash site.
The officials clawed their way up the slippery, granite face of Maoer mountain in Guangxi province and pronounced the mission a success despite the injury in a fall of a U.S. reporter accompanying them.
""We consider this a very successful mission,"" said Alan Liotta, deputy director of the MIA/POW (Missing in Action/Prisoner of War) office under the Department of Defence.
Speaking to reporters in the town of Xingan after returning from the site late on Tuesday, he said findings confirmed information about the fatal crash that occurred on August 31, 1944.
The B-24 bomber with its 10-man crew never returned from a raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan.
""Any step that we can take to bring a case closer to resolution and to provide a family some answers ...indeed gives us some satisfaction,"" Liotta told reporters.
The six-man forensic team from the Department of Defence flew into the Guangxi region on Monday to try to recover remains and learn more about the crash.
Local residents, searching for wild herbs in the region's thick forest, discovered the crash site last October.
U.S. officials first learned of the find when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian gave U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry two dogtags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington last month.
Chinese authorities will turn over some of the remains later on Wednesday and a formal ceremony is to be held in Beijing on Friday.
The human remains would be taken back to the United States for identification, Liotta said.
The U.S. team's elation at reaching what was left of the bomber was dulled by an injury to Voice of America journalist Stephanie Ho who was knocked unconscious briefly after she slipped 75 metres (yards) down a slope returning from the site.
Ho lost her footing as she made her way across the moss-covered face of the mountain. A doctor at the scene said her injury was not serious but she was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city of Guilin.
""This was extremely treacherous terrain and a very difficult climb,"" said Liotta.
Journalists who made the trek to the site saw a pile of charred and twisted metal wedged into a narrow crevass on the mountain side. Higher up the slope was a chunk of the plane's fuselage along with part of an engine, also wedged into rock.
""We had a total destruction of the aircraft,"" Liotta said.
Two farmers hunting for wild herbs found the crash site and alerted officials. They will receive 50,000 yuan ($6,000) each as a reward from the state, local authorities said.
U.S. officials said they had made contact with all 10 families of the crewmen aboard the plane.
They also said the site appeared to have been untouched for more than half a century.
""It's no wonder it took 50 years to discover the site,"" said David Rankin, a forensic anthropologist with the Defence Department's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii.
""We are truly talking about an extremely remote, isolated area.""",0
"China said on Thursday that Sino-U.S. trade ties have improved but warned that major problems, including Beijing's long-delayed entry into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), still needed to be resolved.
It also hinted at possible retaliation against a U.S. decision last month to slap punitive charges against Chinese textile quotas -- a move it described as ""totally unacceptable"".
""The Sino-U.S. economic relationship is recovering, but two major issues concerning Sino-U.S. economic links need to be settled,"" the official China Daily on Thursday quoted Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi Wu as saying.
Those two issues were Beijing's failure to join the WTO and the lack of permanent Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status for Chinese goods in the U.S. market.
A recent series of high-level exchanges between Beijing and Washington had helped ease friction over copyright piracy, textile quotas, Taiwan and human rights, the newspaper quoted Wu as saying.
""The tension in the Sino-U.S. relationship has been alleviated,"" Wu said, adding that further progress would hinge on Washington's stance towards Beijing's entry into the WTO and its yearly review of MFN.
""The annual examination of China's MFN status is already a shadow over Chinese and U.S. enterprises and adds a factor of instability,"" Wu said.
Washington annually reviews China's MFN status, which confers on trading partners the lowest possible tariffs. Beijing has urged the United States to make such treatment permanent.
""We hope the Most Favoured Nation issue will be solved once and for all,"" Wu said.
China is one of the United States' largest trading partners.
U.S. companies sold about $12 billion worth of goods to China last year, while Americans bought some $46 billion worth Chinese products.
Wu also called on Washington to work harder with Beijing to hammer out conditions whereby China could secure a coveted seat in the WTO, saying such moves would benefit trade links.
China has insisted on entering the world trade body under the easier terms accorded to developing nations. But many developed nations, including the United States, have demanded tougher entry requirements because of the sheer size of China's economy.
""Smooth settlement of the two issues would prove to be a great impetus to Sino-U.S. trade and economic cooperation,"" Wu said.
He said China's total foreign trade would hit $280 billion this year and forecast that figure to balloon to $400 billion in 2000 and $800 billion in 2010. She did not say how much exports or imports were expected to be.
Last month the United States decided to set punitive charges against China's 1996 textile quotas in a move that Beijing says was made without full consultation.
""We would like the United States to change it's decision,"" Wu said. ""Otherwise, China will take measures in response.""",0
"North Korea expects a shortfall of two million tonnes of grain next year -- equal to 40 percent of the nation's needs and significantly worse than expected, a Red Cross official said on Monday.
Only a few months ago, aid workers had estimated the food shortage would be 1.5 million tonnes.
""Their shortages are serious...they (North Korean officials) have not been able to meet the daily food ration,"" said Ole Gronning, representative of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in North Korea's capital of Pyongyang.
""This is bad news, really bad news in a country that already doesn't have much now,"" Gronning said by telephone.
He said farmers whose crops had been wiped out by devastating floods in July had eaten about 400,000 tonnes of grain before it came to maturity, adding this would worsen the food shortage this winter.
North Korea has faced the spectre of famine since July after the floods destroyed about 373,000 tonnes of grain, compounding damage from widespread floods in 1995.
Official figures showed North Korea would need 5.5 million tonnes of grain next year, but this year's harvest had yielded just 3.5 million tonnes, Gronning said.
The federation was trying to raise $10.5 million for a new programme to buy grain to stave off hunger for some 140,000 North Koreans badly hit by the floods, he said.
""In some of the villages and the valleys we are now going into, they were working on repairing the damage from the 1995 floods and then they got hit once again,"" he said.
""They have lost everything, including houses, livestock and so on,"" he said.
The summer floods had submerged large tracts of arable land for more than 10 days. Some of that land was now covered in sand and mud and could not be farmed again.
""The second floods left people in a really bad situation,"" Gronning said. ""People will be running out of food in the second half of December.""
The federation would work with the North Korean Red Cross Society to distribute a daily ration of 450 grams (15.75 ounces) of grain and a helping of supplementary foods such as soybeans to each person, he said.
Aid workers would try to provide stricken residents with winter clothes and blankets to brace against winter temperatures that could drop as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said.
""Without enough food and without proper heating, these people are really badly off,"" he said.
North Korea, despite its philosophy of self-reliance, cracked open the door to foreign aid last year in the face of looming food shortages.
Gronning said the federation had appealed to member societies in Europe, North America and Japan to donate money urgently needed to start buying grain and clothes.
""Hopefully, we will have the first pledges very, very soon so we can start purchasing,"" he said.",0
"China said on Tuesday it had drawn a pledge from Guatemala not to support Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations, winning a round in its campaign to isolate the island on the world stage.
Guatemala had promised to abide by a U.N. resolution stating there was only one China and that Beijing was the sole legal representative of China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a regular news briefing.
""They pledged to respect the provisions of Resolution 2758 of the General Assembly and to use it as a guide to relevant actions in the United Nations,"" Shen said.
""According to this resolution, Guatemala cannot support Taiwan's actions to regain entry to the United Nations,"" Shen told reporters.
With China voting in favour, the U.N. Security Council on Monday approved the dispatch of 155 U.N. military observers to monitor peace accords in Guatemala that ended three decades of civil war in the Central American nation.
China had vetoed a similar resolution on January 10 because of Guatemala's ties to Taiwan, which Beijing views as a rebel province not entitled to diplomatic relations.
The 14 other Security Council members all supported sending the peacekeepers to Guatemala but a negative vote by China, one of five permanent council members with veto power, killed the three-month mission.
China and Guatemala had held several rounds of negotiations at the United Nations to seek a solution to the impasse, Shen said.
""Guatemala indicated it realised the gravity and sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and showed a willingness to take a positive approach,"" Shen said.
""This has borne great fruit for us,"" Shen said in a reference to Beijing's diplomatic coup in eroding some of the support Taiwan can muster for its U.N. bid from among its few remaining diplomatic allies.
Guatemala is among some 30 nations, mostly from Africa and Central America, that officially recognise Taipei instead of Beijing. Taiwan has doled out generous amounts of aid to these countries.
Taiwan's allies have co-sponsored an annual, unsuccessful resolution aimed at regaining U.N. membership for the island, which lost its seat in the world body to the People's Republic of China in 1971. Taiwan's campaign sends Beijing into a fury.
Taiwan and China have been arch rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
Taiwan says it is committed to eventual reunification but Beijing accuses Taipei of secretly working for independence and has moved to block the island's drive to gain more international recognition.
Guatemalan officials say they have not broken off diplomatic relations with Taiwan, although China had never requested they do so.
Diplomats said Beijing had also demanded a public apology from Guatemala for inviting Taiwan's foreign minister to the December 29 peace signing ceremonies. Guatemala has refused.
The U.N. mission will send 155 military observers to Guatemala for three months to monitor U.N.-brokered peace accords aimed at cutting the numbers of government troops and disarming guerrillas.
The peace process was to have begun later this week and be monitored by the military observers, who will now take weeks longer to arrive.",0
"China warned Taiwan on Wednesday not to seek independence from the communist mainland, hinting the island would meet disaster if Taipei insisted on splitting from the motherland.
Taipei had failed to answer a 1995 call by Chinese President Jiang Zemin for reconciliation and had instead actively sought to split Taiwan from mainland China, the official Xinhua news agency said.
""We urge the Taiwan authorities to rein themselves in at the precipice so that they can see clearly that the status of Taiwan being part of China cannot be changed and that the trend of Taiwan's reunion with the motherland cannot be resisted,"" the agency said in a commentary.
Beijing, which views Taiwan as a rebel province, refuses to rule out the use of force to recover the island if Taipei declares independence.
However, the tough commentary by China's state news agency held out the possibility of a resumption of quasi-official talks if Taiwan's authorities showed they sincerely wanted the eventual unification they say is their goal.
The commentary was issued to mark the second anniversary of a conciliatory speech by Jiang, who urged an end to hostilities between the bitter political rivals and the opening of direct trade links.
Taiwan officials had shrugged off Jiang's olive branch and were actively working to divide China and further block economic and trade links, Xinhua said.
""The Taiwan authorities advocate 'splitting the country and ruling under separate regimes' and 'two equal political entities', which are in fact aimed at tearing apart China's sovereignty and territory,"" the agency said.
It said people gifted with insight and who had at heart the fundamental interests of Taiwan's people should unite and remove obstacles preventing talks.
""The Taiwan authorities, under pressure both from within and without, have to respond to the important speech of President Jiang Zemin and at least gesture to make strategic readjustments regarding some questions in the cross-straits relations,"" Xinhua said. It did not specify what adjustments were needed.
Taiwan has barred direct trade and transport links with the mainland since the two were separated at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Taipei has clung to its ban as a last bargaining chip in talks on reunification with Beijing.
China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year is expected to give Beijing more leverage in any talks.
""With the return of Hong Kong and that of Macau in 1999, the solution of the Taiwan question and the motherland's reunification will become more prominent issues for all Chinese people,"" Xinhua said.
Analysts have said Jiang is eager to bring Taiwan into the mainland's communist fold to etch his name in history alongside the late Chairman Mao Zedong and current paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who negotiated the return of Hong Kong from Britain.
China would continue to promote economic exchanges between the two sides while keeping a vigilant watch over any movement toward independence for Taiwan, the Xinhua commentary said.
""The fight against separatism and Taiwan independence has illustrated the Chinese people's strong determination and ability...to strike hard against separatist activities and Taiwan-independence forces in Taiwan,"" the agency said.",0
"China issued an anti-corruption communique to the Communist Party on Thursday, warning members of the party that swept to power in 1949 on a platform of integrity not to exploit official power for personal profit.
The communique, issued by the ruling party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, also warned officials and the 57 million party members not to hold political views that differ from the party line.
Beijing had scored great successes in battling graft in 1996 but further efforts were needed to combat official corruption this year, said the communique, published by the People's Daily, mouthpiece of the ruling party. ""We must see with a clear head that the phenomenon of corruption still exists and in some places is spreading rapidly,"" the communique said.
""Some unhealthy tendencies still have not been effectively contained and officials in some places and departments still do not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the anti-corruption drive,"" it said. The communique followed a speech on Wednesday by President Jiang Zemin, who has staked much of his political credibility on fighting graft and who said the anti-corruption battle was a struggle upon which the fate of the nation and party depended.
It reminded government officials that they were forbidden from exploiting their political clout to secure loans, goods or business contracts for their spouses or children.
Beijing would also punish officials in loss-making state-owned firms who used company funds for personal use or who caused huge business losses through mismanagement, it said.
Disciplinary watchdogs would maintain a vigilant eye for officials who failed to toe the party line and be good communists, it said.
""Officials at every level...must strictly observe political discipline and maintain agreement with the central government in politics, ideology and action,"" it said.
""Party members, leaders and officials must...be honest in performing their duties, be staunch in their faith in communism and diligently uphold communist values,"" it said.
Those who violated political discipline would be strictly punished, it said without elaborating.
Corruption, virtually unknown in China under the strict Stalinist rule of the late party Chairman Mao Zedong, who led the communists to power in 1949, has boomed during nearly two decades of market-oriented economic reform.
Disciplinary authorities punished more than 116,000 officials for exploiting their positions for personal gain in 1996, up 14.3 percent from the year before, discipline committee chairman Wei Jianxing said this week.
More than 72,000 officials had owned up to using their power to obtain better housing, with 74 percent handing over a total of 94 million yuan ($11.3 million) to pay for the housing.
Analysts say Jiang, who in 1989 was plucked from his post as Shanghai party secretary to become anointed successor to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, is anxious to win popular loyalty with his high-profile anti-graft campaign.
While the president and party chief has won some credit from the netting of corrupt senior officials such as former Beijing party chief and Politburo member Chen Xitong, many Chinese say results of the corruption crackdown have been patchy at best.",0
"Leading Chinese activist Wang Dan will go on trial on Wednesday, charged with the capital crime of plotting to overthrow the government, a family member said.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court had told Wang's family that his trial would begin on Wednesday morning, his mother Wang Lingyun said by telephone on Friday.
Court officials could not be reached for comment.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, said she would be in court to help defend her son against some of the charges.
Wang's family earlier found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader on most of the charges after being given just one day in which to do so.
""As for family members, only Wang Dan's father and his sister will be able to attend,"" she said, adding she hoped the court would judge her son based on the facts of the case.
""I'm hoping the trial outcome will go according to the facts and the law, and that Wang Dan will be found not guilty,"" she said. ""We'll have to see at the end.""
She said she was doubtful court officials would let her talk to her son before the trial.
""I don't think they'll make such arrangements,"" she said, adding that court officials had given her no further details about the trial.
Court officials have confirmed that Wang, who vanished into detention in May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.
The court has not given further details of the trial but one official has said that Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.
Wang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, the father of China's democracy movement, a political activist said.
In December Wei was sentenced to 14 years in prison for subversion and funding democracy activists.
The court is widely expected to fill the limited number of courtroom seats at Wang's trial with carefully selected people to keep away foreign reporters and fellow dissidents.
Dissidents and foreign reporters were barred from Wei's trial but the cases of both Wei and Wang have drawn worldwide attention and are regularly raised by visiting western politicians.
Wang, 26, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
Wang Lingyun has said the dissident has been very calm and was mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, though she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.
Wang Dan had been active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has in recent months cracked down on its tiny band of remaining dissidents who have not yet fled into exile or been imprisoned.",0
"Xujiachong village in central China's Hubei province is nestled in a lush, narrow valley dotted with whitewashed concrete houses, small cabbage patches and freshwater fish ponds.
Ruddy-cheeked children peer out of ill-lit doorways while farmers steer belching tractors along dirt roads lined with orange trees, their verdant branches heavy with the bright, tart fruit.
Xujiachong is much like any other village in China, except that it is scheduled to be wiped off the map by the end of next year.
The village of 2,480 people is just one of hundreds of towns and hamlets that will be flooded by the silt-laden waters of the Yangtze river when the mighty waterway is diverted in November 1997 as part of the giant Three Gorges dam project.
""The total number of people to be relocated under the Three Gorges project, those in submerged areas, is now 840,000,"" said Wang Jiazhu, deputy general manager of the China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Co that is building the mammoth dam.
""We are estimating there could be a million or 1.2 million at most, taking into account the population increase during the 17 years of construction,"" Wang said.
In Yichang county, site of the future dam, more than 12,300 people have been resettled from the sprawling construction site that flanks the broad, snaking river, said Wang Jiangyi, deputy director of the Yichang Resettlement Bureau.
Evacuation of the giant reservoir area -- to cover more than 600 square km (230 square miles) -- began in 1994 and will involve moving about 100,000 people from Yichang county alone, Wang Jiangyi said.
LEAVING ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS
The fates of hundreds of thousands of households in Hubei and neighbouring Sichuan province were sealed in 1992 when Beijing ended seven decades of debate to give the green light to start work on the gargantuan dam that is to harness the power of the world's third longest river.
Beijing hopes the project, to be completed in the year 2009, will help to power China's economic charge in the 21st century and bring an end to disastrous flooding that has claimed the lives of more than 300,000 people in this century alone.
Officials say they have run into opposition from many local residents unwilling to abandon their ancestral homes and traditional lifestyles.
""There are residents who aren't willing to move,"" said Wang Kaidong, village chief of Xujiachong, which is just two km (1.2 miles) from the dam site.
""It is understandable that they don't want to leave the homes their families have occupied for generations,"" she said.
IDEOLOGICAL WEAPONS AND CASH CARROTS
Communist Party officials have tried to combat anti-relocation sentiment by preaching traditional communist values of self-sacrifice while holding out cash and material incentives.
""The magic weapon of our party is ideological work,"" said Wang Kaidong. ""We talk face to face with residents about the resettlement policies and compensation standards.""
Of the project's estimated 204 billion yuan ($24.6 billion) cost, about 40 billion yuan has been earmarked to finance the resettlement, said He Gong, a deputy general manager of the Three Gorges Development Co.
Government work teams have fanned out through the countryside offering compensation to residents based on the size and quality of their houses and farms that will be committed to the watery mass grave.
Total compensation for each family ranges from 30,000 to 80,000 yuan and those being resettled to rural areas are to receive parcels of land to build new houses on, Wang Jiangyi of the resettlement bureau said.
Blocks of apartment buildings have sprung up to house those moving into urban areas to be employed in factories or tertiary industries, Wang Jiangyi said.
Relocated families will also enjoy preferential charges for electricity, water and road use and will be allowed to make two moving trips free of charge, Wang Jiangyi said.
If ethical campaigns and cash rewards failed to convince the stubborn to pack up, authorities could still resort to the force of law, Wang said.
""In the resettlement process, if there is any case of... disrupting the public order that prevents the process from proceeding smoothly...it will be dealt with in accordance with punitive public security regulations,"" he said.

"A U.S. forensics team has arrived in China to recover the remains of crew members from a crashed World War Two bomber recently discovered in south-western China, U.S. officials said on Sunday.
The team from the U.S. Department of Defence would focus on recovering and identifying the remains of the doomed bomber's crew, a U.S. official told reporters at a briefing.
""Our purpose is to recover all human remains and make the fullest possible identification of the 10 crew members on that plane,"" said the official, who asked not to be identified.
Officials of south-western China's Guangxi region would hand over the remains of the 10 men, aged from 19 to 26, who died when the B-24 bomber slammed into a cliff near scenic Guilin on August 31, 1944 while returning from a bombing raid on Japanese ships around Taiwan, the official said.
Local villagers looking for wild mountain herbs had stumbled across the scattered remnants of the bomber in a remote ravine last October, he said.
U.S. officials first learned of the wreckage when Chinese President Jiang Zemin handed over a video and photographs of the crash site to U.S. President Bill Clinton when the two met in Manila last November at the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Chinese Defence Minister Chi Haotian gave U.S. Secretary of Defence William Perry two dogtags recovered from the site during a meeting in Washington last month.
China's claim that the wreckage was found last October appeared to be true, the official said.
""There's no indication that it is anything other than what they said it was,"" the official said, adding that the Chinese government had given them full cooperation in arranging the repatriation of the remains.
Some analysts have said Beijing may have known of the wreck for some time but has made it public only at a time when it is eager to improve strained ties with Washington.
""The Chinese see this as a humanitarian issue,"" the official said.
U.S. forces lost contact with the bomber after it was forced to change course to Guilin because of a Japanese assault against its original base in Liuzhou, also in Guangxi region, he said.
The cause of the crash was still unknown and the forensic team would not seek to discover what brought the plane down on this trip, he said.
Video footage of the site seen by reporters showed five sets of dog tags, eight pistols, machineguns and other pieces of equipment recovered from the destroyed aircraft.
Chinese authorities had sealed off the crash site and the video and photographs suggested the wreckage had been untouched for more than 52 years, the official said.
""The recovery of small items, usually the first things to go, would indicate there has been no scavenging,"" he said.
The remains would be flown back to Hawaii next Friday for analysis and identification, he said, adding that it could take weeks to years to identify the remains.
U.S. officials had made contact with representatives of all 10 families including at least one son, he said.
A U.S. team trekked to a Himalayan site in remote Tibet in 1994 to recover remains from another U.S. aircraft that crashed in 1945, another U.S. official said.
From 500-1,000 U.S. airmen remained unaccounted for after disappearing during World War Two flights over China, where U.S. aviators for years supported attempts by the then Nationalist government to resist Japanese invaders.",0
"General Motors Corp.'s board of directors will likely delay an increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend if it fails to reach a contract deal with the United Auto Workers union before Monday, analysts said Friday.
GM's board is scheduled to meet on Monday and will consider the automaker's fourth quarter dividend, but Dean Witter analyst Ron Glantz said an increase will send the wrong message to the union.  
""Unless a settlement is reached by Sunday, the board is not going to throw gasoline onto the fire,"" said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. auto analyst Ron Glantz.
A dividend hike now could jeopardize the long-running UAW talks because the automaker is trying to win concessions aimed at cutting costs and allowing it sell off unprofitable parts plants. The two sides are crafting a complicated agreement that is expected to maintain job guarantees set by Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp, but may exclude a number of GM facilities.  
Nevertheless, analysts say GM is due for an increase because of the company's improving cash position and stronger earnings.
The quarterly payout rate on GM's $1-2/3 par-value stock has been unchanged since February, when it was raised to $0.40 a share from $0.30.
Glantz's anticipation of an increase in the dividend and a possible share buyback program was predicated upon having an agreement in hand.
Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi agreed but he noted that GM needs to increase its payout to improve its dividend yield. GM's yield is now 2.98 percent, compared with 4.93 percent for Ford Motor Co and 4.16 percent for Chrysler Corp.
""Shareholders might be better served by letting that sleeping dog lie,"" Phillippi said of a possible dividend increase.
He added that he expects shareholders to remain patient with GM, because the automaker has more to gain by negotiating a UAW contract that allows it reduce its cost disadvantage compared with Ford and Chrysler.
Once a contract is signed, Phillippi said he is looking for GM to raise its dividend by 50 percent, or $0.20 a share, in two increments.
GM shares were up 1/8 at 54.",0
"The United Auto Workers union is discussing the possibility of an extended five- or six-year contract with the nation's largest automakers, UAW and company officials said Monday.
The union is open to the idea of a contract longer than the typical three-year pact if it offers significant job security guarantees, officials said.
""It has surfaced in the subcommittees,"" said Carl Dowell, president of UAW Local 862 in Louisville, Ky. ""There was no problem with a longer-term agreement if it's fruitful for our people. Job security is the key.""
Contract talks with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. resumed Monday after meetings late last week between UAW President Stephen Yokich and the automakers' chairmen.
The UAW has not yet chosen which company it will negotiate a pattern agreement with. Yokich said last week that he delayed the union's traditional choice of a ""strike target"" to allow the negotiating progress to continue at all three companies.
A UAW spokesman said no decision on a target company is expected this week.
Traditionally, the target is threatened with a national strike on the contract expiration date if no agreement is reached by then. The current pact, covering about 400,000 U.S. hourly workers at the three automakers, expires September 14.
Ford spokesman Jon Harmon said the automaker suggested to the UAW about three weeks ago that both sides should examine possibly negotiating a longer-term contract.
He said a longer agreement would stabilise Ford's future costs, allowing it to evaluate future product and investment decisions more accurately. ""It gives you more of a known quantity,"" he said.
Yokich has said he would be open to a longer contract if the automakers ""want to buy it.""
However, many UAW officials remain sceptical about a longer-term pact and say that removal of a strike threat every three years could invite abuses by the automakers.
""The question is how can GM live up to a five-year agreement when they can't live up to a three-year agreement?"" said Ed McNulty, president of UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, truck transmission plant.
Such an agreement would have to provide a mechanism for enforcement of the contract and for revisions to resolve local issues over sourcing and staffing levels that are sure to arise over the life of the contract, he said.
GM has been hit by several strikes at individual plants over the current three-year contract over sourcing and jobs.
""You're going to have to have some good job security and outsourcing provisions for the membership to go for it,"" McNulty said.",0
"After meeting for nearly 32 hours, most bargainers for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union adjourned talks without a national contract deal Thursday night as several more truck plants headed for strike-related shutdowns.
""Talks in several specific areas will continue tonight,"" said GM spokesman Charles Licari. ""Full negotiations will resume Friday morning as bargainers continue their efforts to reach a tentative agreement.""
He declined to identify the areas to be discussed Thursday night.
Talks ""have snagged several times in the past week,"" said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California-Berkeley. ""The pressure's been increased considerably by the two plants that are out on strike.""
Indeed, plant-level union officials said the number of workers idled by local strikes in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis., could reach nearly 21,000 by Saturday.
GM truck plants in Moraine, Ohio, and Flint, Mich., were expected to run out of fenders, hoods, and other sheet-metal parts from GM's strikebound Indianapolis stamping plant by late Thursday night, officials at the plants said.
Flint employs about 2,000 workers and builds crew-cab and heavy-duty, full-size pickup trucks, while Moraine employs about 4,000 and builds Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy compact sport utility vehicles.
""B-crew will come in tonight and that'll be it,"" said George Dunaway, vice president of International Union of Electronics Workers Local 801 in Moraine. Although his union is not involved in the UAW talks, he supports the strikers in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis.
""A lot of their concerns are our concerns,"" he said.
Some states may determine that the laid-off workers won't be eligible for state unemployment benefits because they were idled by a strike.
The remainder of the nine GM truck plants fed by Indianapolis are expected to halt operations soon.
GM's Shreveport, La., compact pickup truck plant is scheduled to shut down Friday, idling 2,500 workers, and the Linden, N.J. plant, which employs 2,500 and builds both compact pickups and sport utility vehicles, will shut down Friday night.
GM's Fort Wayne plant laid off about 2,250 of its 2,600 workers as it halted production of GM's popular full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks Wednesday night. GM's other full-size truck plants in Pontiac, Mich., Oshawa, Ontario, and Silao, Mexico, are expected to follow close behind.
The strikes on Tuesday by 2,750 workers at Indianapolis and 4,800 workers in Janesville, Wis., have formed a two-pronged effort to squeeze GM's highly profitable light truck operations, increasing pressure for national and local settlements.
The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, adding to pressure on the automaker for national and local contract settlements, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.
Meanwhile, other UAW locals sought to join the Indianapolis and Janesville walkouts. GM's Kokomo, Ind., electronics plant requested permission to send about 5,500 workers out on strike.
A walkout at that facility would be particularly damaging to GM because it supplies all of the automaker's North American assembly plants with engine electronics, audio systems and other parts.
The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs..

"Strong demand for light trucks and relatively few production headaches boosted the combined profits of the Big Three U.S. automakers to nearly $2 billion in the third quarter, exceeding year-ago results by a healthy margin, analysts said.
The third quarter is traditionally the industry's weakest, with summer vacations and model changeovers, but strong minivan and truck output helped buoy profits at Chrysler Corp and Ford Motor Co, they said.  
General Motors Corp operating earnings were held back by a significant increase in U.S. incentives, analysts said.
In the third quarter of 1995 the three automakers earned a combined total of $1.35 billion.
""It'll be a good quarter overall for the Big Three,"" said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Kenneth Blaschke. ""The issue that remains is how long the strike in Canada against GM will last.""
GM is expected to report third quarter net income of about $850 million, or $1.02 a share, according to First Call.  
The results will include an after-tax gain of $250 million, or $0.33 a share, from the reversal of GM's decision to close its Wilmington, Del., plant and build a new Saturn model there at the end of the decade.
In the year-ago third quarter GM earned $642 million, or $0.42 a share, including $246 million in earnings from Electronic Data Systems Corp, the computer services unit spun off by GM in June.
Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said GM's worldwide car and truck production rose 11 percent in the third quarter over a year ago.  
But a heavier mix of less-expensive vehicles and a $230 increase in incentives per vehicle squeezed GM profit margins, which likely resulted in a small pretax loss in North America during the period, he said.
GM is to report third quarter results on October 15.
On an operating basis, Ford's third quarter profits are expected to increase 78 percent, to $637 million, or $0.51 a share, from $357 million, or $0.28, a year earlier, marking the biggest rebound of the Big Three. Ford results are due October 16.  
The strength at Ford largely rides on the fact that it is not paying the enormous product launch costs for the Taurus sedan and F-Series pickup truck that dragged down year-ago results.
Ford also is beginning to reap profits from the F-Series and the Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle, which have brightened the automaker's outlook.
""We think Ford's new products will enable it to gain an increased share going forward, and as a result Ford's earnings momentum should continue,"" Blaschke said.  
Ford's profits would have been even better but for losses in Brazil and Argentina that the automaker warned about in September.
Ford is scambling to put its Fiesta small car into production in Brazil following the breakup of the company's Autolatina joint venture with Volkswagen AG in 1995.
Chrysler's third quarter profits, scheduled for release October 14, are expected to increase 41 percent, to about $500 million, or $0.69 a share, from $354 million, or $0.48, a year earlier.
Chrysler also experienced launch problems in the year-ago period in its all-important minivan product lines.
This year, it is churning out minivans and Dodge Ram pickup trucks and has raised its share of the U.S. vehicle market to record levels. The launch glitches have not returned, and the company's new Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck is proceeding ahead of schedule, analysts said.
""Chrysler has everthing going for it right now and it should be reflected in the earnings,"" said Bear Stearns & Co analyst Nicholas Lobocarro.
He said he would not be surprised if the automaker's results exceeded Wall Street estimates.",0
"Second-shift workers at General Motors Corp. 's Cadillac assembly plant here will not report to work on Monday because of the Canadian Auto Workers strike and thousands more U.S. assembly employees may be laid off this week, GM said on Sunday.
The Cadillac plant on the outskirts of Detroit will operate with only one shift on Monday and Tuesday, when it is expected to halt production completely unless the strike is resolved, GM spokesman Thomas Klipstine said.
""Once they run out of parts, that's it,"" he said.
The plant employs more than 3,000 hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers union, but Klipstine said he did not know the exact number of workers on each shift.
The sprawling factory, which builds Cadillac's DeVille, Seville and Eldorado luxury cars, depends on interior trim parts made at a strike-bound plant in Windsor, Ontario, just across the Detroit River.
GM's Canadian workers began an escalating strike on Oct. 3, shutting down all of the automaker's operations in Canada by late on Oct. 9.
The company and union have been unable to reach an agreement for a new national labour contract for GM's 26,000 CAW members because of disagreements over the thorny issue of shifting parts work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing.
The union wants tough restrictions on outsourcing to protect its members' jobs, while GM, the least efficient automaker in North America, says it needs flexibility on parts purchases to become more competitive.
So far, GM's U.S. operations have been relatively untouched by the strike in Canada, largely because the CAW gave the automaker ample warning that it was preparing to strike. That, coupled with the slow escalation of the strike over a week-long period, allowed GM to build up stocks of some parts and prepare for the walkout.
""The bottom line is there was no surprise with this strike,"" Klipstine said. ""We did as much as we could, but we don't have huge amounts of parts stockpiled.""
Klipstine said he did not know how much longer GM could operate its U.S. plants.
Industry analysts have said some of GM's plants may be able to continue to operate until the end of the month, particularly those that build GM's popular full-size pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
On Friday, Ford Motor Co. President Alex Trotman said he did not believe his company would be able to gain a significant amount of market share due to the strike, because there has been ""little evidence"" that GM's hottest-selling truck lines will be affected.
Most GM dealers have sufficient car inventories to weather the strike without turning away customers, he said.
Thus far, the CAW has been responsible for the idling of only 2,000 U.S. workers.
The walkout forced the layoff of 1,050 workers at an engine plant in Tonawanda, N.Y., near Buffalo, and 950 at a transmission plant in Ypsilanti, Mich., near Detroit.
By contrast, a UAW strike in March at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants had forced more than 55,000 of GM's workers off the job just one week after that walkout began.
No formal talks were scheduled between GM and the CAW, although CAW President Buzz Hargrove was expected to be in contact with GM's chief negotiator, Dean Munger.
Canada celebrates its national Thanksgiving Day holiday on Monday.
Meanwhile, in the United States, negotiators working towards a contract for GM's 215,000 United Auto Workers members also took the weekend off.
The UAW talks have taken a low profile during the Canadian strike.",0
"General Motors Corp cut a deal to end a costly strike at an Indianapolis metal stamping plant on Saturday, about 14 hours after it announced a tentative national contract agreement with the United Auto Workers union.
The five-day Indianapolis strike had threatened to paralyze most of GM's North American light truck production by early next week. Along with a second, still-unresolved walkout at GM's Janesville, Wisconsin, truck plant, the dispute was responsible for the idling of more than 19,000 workers.
But the 2,750 Indianapolis strikers could be back on the job stamping out fenders, doors, hoods and other truck body parts by Sunday night following a ratification vote scheduled for Sunday morning, said Patrick Morrissey, a spokesman for GM's Metal Fabricating Division.
However, GM's full-size pickup truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, may still shut down on Monday due to shortages of Indianapolis-made parts, joining four other idled truck plants and an crippled engine plant.
Ronald Gettelfinger, UAW regional director in Indianapolis, said the new local labor agreement, reached at about 6:15 p.m. EST (2315 GMT) on Saturday, was not influenced by the national GM-UAW labor accord, which covers 215,000 U.S. hourly workers.
The national contract defines wages, benefits, job security and other broad issues, while local pacts cover plant specific issues like work rules and staffing levels.
""We've got great negotiators at the top,"" Gettelfinger said. ""This was local issues.""
He declined to discuss the grievances that sparked the strike. They were believed to include demands for more jobs to cope with an increasing workload and protections for skilled trades workers.
UAW President Stephen Yokich, who announced the national pact at a 2 a.m. EST (0700 GMT) news conference, held out the threat of more local strikes to keep GM from dragging its feet in negotiations with its 123 locals.
""We can't tell you what's going to happen in the other locals,"" Yokich said. ""I would suggest that the company work very hard and get their locals cleaned up.""
President Bill Clinton applauded UAW-GM agreement on Saturday. ""I am very hopeful that the tentative agreement will be ratified and that the outstanding local issues will quickly be resolved so that everyone can get back to work,"" he said.
About 4,800 workers in Janesville remain on strike, although UAW Local 95 officials said local talks intensified on Saturday. The plant, which builds GM's popular Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport-utility vehicles, is one of the automaker's most profitable factories.
Analysts estimate the UAW-related shutdowns will cost the carmaker up to $20 million a day in lost profits, on top of an estimated $350 million loss from a Canadian walkout that ended on Oct. 23.
The UAW-GM national agreement will be submitted to rank-and-file members for ratification after about 250 UAW leaders meet to consider the pact on Wednesday in Chicago. The deal was unanimously approved by the union's national GM bargaining council.
Details of the pact were not released on Saturday, but Gerald Knechtel, GM vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp
Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces and will give workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent raises in the second and third years of the contract.
One union official said the pact maintains the 95 percent job guarantee but allows GM some flexibility to exit certain unprofitable businesses and to allow employment at some factories to fall below that threshold.
In a sign that contentious issues remain, company and union officials did not announce the pact in a joint news conference with the traditional handshakes and smiles. Instead, they made grim-faced separate statements to reporters gathered at GM's Detroit headquarters building.
""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.""",0
"Chrysler Corp. said Monday it rode strong sales of its pickup trucks, minivans and sport/utility vehicles to a 92 percent jump in third-quarter profits, soundly beating Wall Street's optimistic forecasts.
Detroit's No. 3 automaker earned $680 million, or 93 cents a share, in the July-September period, setting records for both net income and earnings per share for the third quarter.
A year earlier, when Chrysler was struggling through the slow production launch of its current-generation minivans, the company earned just $354 million, or 45 cents a share.
""Chrysler's performance in the third quarter was outstanding,"" Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. ""It was fuelled by record-setting demand for our products, which led to a new third-quarter U.S. retail unit sales record and produced the best model year for U.S. retail unit sales in the company's history.""
The results included an after-tax charge of $55 million, or 7 cents a share, to cover costs of an early retirement programme. About 531 salaried employees opted to leave the company under the programme during the quarter.
Excluding the charge, Chrysler earned $735 million, or $1 a share, from operations, solidly exceeding Wall Street estimates. According to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates, analysts had expected Chrysler to earn about $520 million, or 71 cents a share.
Chrysler shares jumped $1 to $32.75 after touching $33 on the New York Stock Exchange.
""I think it was all in the sales mix,"" Burnham Securities analyst David Healy said of Chrysler's strong performance. ""They've raised prices and the mix has shifted to trucks. They're selling not so many Neons and a lot more Jeep Grand Cherokees and Town & Country minivans.""
Indeed, light trucks -- which typically carry higher profit margins than passenger cars -- made up 66 percent of Chrysler's sales mix, versus 62 percent in the 1995 quarter. The automaker had full availability of its new minivans, and a St. Louis plant that had just started building Dodge Ram pickup trucks in August 1995 is now churning the vehicles out.
Chrysler earned a profit of $982 on each vehicle in the quarter, almost double the $492 earned per vehicle a year earlier. Incentive spending fell to $685 per vehicle from $870 a year ago, but was up from $625 in the second quarter.
Chrysler Chief Financial Officer Gary Valade said he expected similar conditions in the fourth quarter, and added that Chrysler next year plans another big increase in truck-building capacity.
He told reporters on a conference call that the automaker will be able to build 190,000 more trucks in 1997 than in 1996, including the launch of a new Dodge sport/utility vehicle at Chrysler's Newark, Del., plant.
The four-door vehicle is expected to be based on the new Dodge Dakota pickup truck that Chrysler is launching and will give Dodge dealers their first sport/utility vehicle since the two-door Ram Charger was discontinued in 1993.
Valade said Chrysler will end the year with about 16.2 percent of the North American car and light truck market, but cautioned the company will be prudent when adding capacity.
""We don't feel ourselves share constrained at this 16 percent share level, but neither are we hell-bent to get to 20 (percent) at any cost,"" he said.
Sales climbed to $14.4 billion, a third-quarter record and up 20 percent from $12.0 billion in the 1995 quarter.
The automaker said it shipped 650,529 cars and trucks, up from 581,853 in the year-ago period, boosting its share of the combined U.S. and Canadian retail car and truck market to 15.5 percent from 13.6 percent in the third quarter of 1995.
In the international market, Chrysler's retail sales were 57,209 vehicles, up 19 percent over the 48,207 vehicles it sold in the third quarter of 1995.
In Europe, Chrysler vehicle sales rose 28 percent.
The automaker said it bought back $452 million of its common stock in the quarter, bringing the total for 1996 to $1.6 billion, out of a $2 billion programme. The company bought back $1 billion worth of stock in 1995 and under its five-year peace accord with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, has pledged to buy back another $1 billion in 1997.
For the nine months, earnings were $2.72 billion, or $3.65 a share, nearly triple the $985 million, or $1.28 a share, in the first nine months of 1995.",0
"Local strikes in Wisconsin and Indiana began taking their toll on the rest of General Motors Corp.'s truck production Wednesday, clouding the automaker's national contract talks with the United Auto Workers.
GM said the day-old walkout at its Indianapolis metal stamping plant would force it to halt production of full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks at its Fort Wayne, Ind., assembly plant Wednesday night.
The Indianapolis walkout on Tuesday has halted shipments of major steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American truck assembly plants, threatening to shut them down within days.
Analysts said Wednesday the cost of the strikes by 2,750 workers in Indianapolis and 4,800 workers at its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant could mount quickly, eating into profits from GM's lucrative light truck operations.
The shutdown of the Janesville plant alone could cost GM $50 million a week in pre-tax profits, said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.
The southern Wisconsin factory, which employs 4,800 workers, is the sole source for GM's popular four-door, full-size Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utility vehicles. Analysts estimate that GM makes about $9,000 in variable profits on each of the trucks.
In addition to Janesville and Fort Wayne, the Indianapolis plant supplies facilities in Pontiac and Flint, Mich.; Oshawa, Ontario; Linden, N.J.; Shreveport, La.; Moraine, Ohio, and Silao, Mexico.
""It really starts to add up quickly when you add in all of the other big C/K pickups they can lose,"" said Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi.
The UAW strikes came as GM is still staggering from a three-week strike in Canada that curtailed production at a number of U.S. plants and may cost up to $450 million.
On Wednesday, GM said it still had 23,158 U.S. workers idled due to shortages of Canadian-made parts, but added that 3,200 workers at its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich., were scheduled to return to work on Thursday.
No other UAW strikes had started on Wednesday, but UAW spokesman Reg McGhee said the union was not ruling out other walkouts. UAW President Stephen Yokich raised the threat of local strikes on Monday after GM's national contract covering 215,000 UAW workers expired.
""Steve made it clear that without a national contract, the locals are on their own,"" McGhee said, noting that they do not have to provide GM with the typical five-day notice before a walkout.
Some UAW officials speculated that other stamping and parts plants may also be struck, because they would force shutdowns at other facilities.
National contract talks continued Wednesday at GM's Detroit headquarters, but officials declined to say whether progress was being made.
""Talks are taking place at all levels,"" said GM spokesman Charles Licari.
Although UAW officials said the strikes were called over local issues, analysts said it was clear that the actions were aimed at pushing GM into a tentative national agreement.
That may take place before Saturday, when about 250 UAW leaders from GM plants across the nation are scheduled to meet in Detroit to discuss the status of the talks.
The future of 12 domestic parts plants that GM considers uncompetitive remained a major sticking point in the negotiations Wednesday. GM wants to exclude several of the plants from union demands that it guarantee employment for 95 percent of UAW workers over the next three years.
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have already granted such guarantees, but GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, wants changes to the pattern to allow it to cut costs.
GM has already put two of the 12 plants on the sale block -- a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that together employ 2,100 workers.
""We know the sale is going to happen. We're concerned about what's going to happen to us,"" said Whitey Hale, president of UAW Local 326 in Flint.",0
"Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB.
Lear said it signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire Borealis Industrier AB for undisclosed terms.
Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, Borealis Industrier manufacturers instrument panels, door panels, climate systems, exterior trim and various other components for the European car and truck industry.
Borealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people.
Primary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB.
Borealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy  and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS.
Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions.
Lear said the acquisition supports its strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels.
""Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage,"" Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement.
The deal is the latest of a series of consolidation moves in the automotive interior market. Lear earlier this year purchased carpet and floor-mat maker Masland Corp. for $384 million, and last year bought door panel and console maker Automotive Industries Inc for $626 million.
Lear's U.S. operations include the manufacturing of a wide range of automotive interior components.
The company's stock was unchanged Friday at $38 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lear's competitors are also pursuing the same acquisition strategy.
Johnson Controls Inc., which has a strong seating business, recently acquired interior parts maker Prince Automotive, based in Holland Mich., for $1.35 billion in cash.
Canada's Magna International Inc., one of the ""Big Three"" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas & Lomason Co. for $135 million.",0
"General Motors Corp.  has packed its new EV1 electric vehicle with exotic materials and sophisticated, unproven technology, but is taking a cautious approach to introducing it to the public.
GM officials said Tuesday they plan to offer the two-seat car only on three-year leases and will hold the customer's hand virtually every step of the way.
""Our total focus is to provide a hassle-free experience and comprehensive customer care,"" said Joseph Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing for GM's Saturn unit, which will sell the EV1 under the GM nameplate.
The first modern production car designed from the ground up to be an electric vehicle, the EV1 will roll into Saturn dealerships sometime this fall in the Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., areas. Colder climates would shorten the vehicles' already limited range, which is a maximum of 70 to 90 miles under ideal conditions, GM says.
California, which recently eased its 1998 mandate for electric vehicles, is expected to offer consumer incentives for the vehicle.
Depending on such incentives, monthly lease payments on the car will probably fall between $400 and $500, about the same as a $30,000 luxury car, GM officials said at a news briefing.
Customers will have to add another $50 a month or so to lease a 220-volt charging unit and pay to have it mounted in their garage. But the electricity to run the EV1 is a bargain -- about a penny a mile, versus gasoline costs of four to five cents a mile for an average normal car.
GM executives will not discuss production plans or sales targets for the vehicle and say they plan to let market dictate demand. But Kennedy said he expects the initial demand to outstrip supply due to the vehicle's novelty.
So far, about 1,000 people have called a toll-free telephone number, and dealers have taken names of 300 serious customers, including Tonight Show host Jay Leno, he said.
Customers who want performance won't be disappointed with the EV1. The whisper-quiet vehicle offers neck-snapping acceleration and sports-car like handling, although a heavy foot will quickly drain the battery, requiring a three- to four-hour recharge.
""We can keep up with a Nissan 300ZX from zero to 30"" miles an hour, said Sean McNamara, marketing manager for GM's Advanced Technology Vehicles group.
The car's aerodynamic tear-drop shape, considerably narrower in the rear than in the front, slips through the wind easily and looks unlike anything else on the road.
GM could have built a spartan small boxy car but wanted its first electric vehicle to have some flair, said Robert Purcell, general manager of GM Advanced Technology Vehicles.
""This is the car that gets the market started,"" he said. ""We wanted to put out a car that was very exciting so that people would fall in love with it.""
The sporty configuration was aimed at highly educated customers with incomes of $125,000 a year who like high technology, GM said. The customers also likely own two other vehicles for longer trips or heavy hauling.
Saturn, which won't necessarily sell all future GM electric vehicles, plans to emphasise its customer-friendly sales practices more heavily for the EV1.
The decision to lease the vehicle was made in part to protect consumers from the inevitable march of technology. The automaker does not want EV1 customers to be stuck with obsolete cars in a few years, as personal computer owners often are.
At the end of the lease, GM is considering refitting the plastic and aluminum-bodied cars with newer technology and leasing them again, Purcell said.
The division also is training about 14 EV1 ""product specialists"" to handle sales of the vehicle at 26 designated dealerships in California and Arizona.
The specialists will come to a prospective customer's home, office, or elsewhere to explain the details of the car and the charging unit.
They'll work with the utility companies and arrange municipal permits for the installations, Kennedy said, adding that it will probably take about a week to set up a customer with a car and charger.
GM has invested $350 million in developing the EV1, which it does not expect to recoup through sales of the first generation vehicle, Purcell said. But the car does pioneer a wide range of exotic materials and new technology that could find its way to other GM vehicles.
Magnesium and other lightweight materials counteract the weight of batteries, and the cars have braking systems that transfer power back to the battery.
Despite the technology, the cars are largely hand-built at a Lansing, Mich., plant that produced the now-defunct Buick Reatta in the late 1980s. The operation employs 54 production workers but could be expanded quickly, GM officials said.",0
"United Auto Workers bargainers reconvened at General Motors Corp.'s headquarters Tuesday following a day off Monday, but talks between the two sides maintained a low profile, UAW and company spokesmen said.
UAW workers continued to report to their jobs at GM's U.S. factories, despite the expiration of their national labour agreement with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday.
GM spokesman Charles Licari said there were no major ""main-table"" meetings scheduled Tuesday, but key negotiators were communicating in small groups and by telephone.
""Discussions are taking place, but there is no set timetable regarding the negotiations,"" Licari said, adding that such communications still may prove fruitful.
A person close to the talks said, however, that he did not expect the situation to change much before Saturday, when the union's key local GM plant-level leaders are scheduled to meet in Detroit.
UAW President Stephen Yokich recessed the talks on Monday and expressed disappointment with the lack of progress toward a settlement, but he refrained from calling a strike against the world's largest automaker.
Still, Yokich said some of the union's GM locals may resort to strikes if progress in local negotiations does not improve. In addition to the national contract, GM is negotiating with more than 100 UAW locals for pacts that cover plant-specific issues.
In New York on Tuesday, GM Chairman Jack Smith said little about the UAW negotiations, but told reporters that he hoped there would be no local strikes.
The threat of additional strikes comes less than a week after Canadian Auto Workers members returned to work following a three-week walkout over the issues of job security and outsourcing, or the shifting of work to outside contractors.
Smith, speaking at a news conference on alternative fuel vehicles, declined to specify the dollar cost of the strike.
""We lost quite a few cars,"" he said.
GM said Tuesday that 22,913 workers in its U.S. assembly, powertrain and stamping operations remained idle because of lingering shortages of Canadian-made parts.
The automaker said it laid off an additional 465 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, metal stamping plant Tuesday, one of four such plants affected.
GM's nearby Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant remains completely idled, as does its Buick City assembly plant in Flint, Mich. Five other assembly plants remain partially idled, bringing GM's laid off assembly workers to 15,284.
GM has 5,702 engine and transmission workers laid off, with six such powertrain plants partially idled.
In the UAW talks, which cover a total of 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, GM has resisted the union's demand that it follow a pattern set by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and guarantee jobs for 95 percent of current work force over the next three years.
GM wants to exclude from the guarantee several parts plants that it wants to sell. The automaker has identified 12 facilities that it considers uncompetitive.
GM's stock gained 50 cents to $54.375 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement early on Saturday for a new national labor contract, ending months of contentious bargaining.
""I think we said back in June that it would be a difficult negotiation, and I think we fulfilled that expectation,"" said a visibly tired GM Chairman Jack Smith. ""Like any negotiation, you never get everything you want.""
The three-year deal, which covers 215,000 hourly UAW workers, will not end local strikes that started on Tuesday night in Indiana and Wisconsin, where local grievances remain unresolved, UAW President Stephen Yokich said.
He also held out the threat of additional strikes among GM's 123 UAW locals that have not yet reached plant-specific agreements with the automaker.
""I would suggest that the company work hard and get their locals cleaned up,"" Yokich said. ""Quite frankly the two that walked out have a heavy agenda on the table and they have a lot of work.""
Yokich declined to say when the agreement would go to rank-and-file members for ratification, but about 250 local leaders from GM plants around the country would meet in Chicago on Wednesday Nov. 6 to consider the pact.
Instead of the traditional joint statements and handshakes between company and union officials, Yokich insisted that the two sides hold separate news conferences to announce the agreement shortly after 2 a.m. CST (0700 GMT) Saturday.
Details of the agreement were not released, but Gerald Knechtel, vice president of personnel, said it fits within the pattern that the UAW set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp.
Both of those companies agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly workforces.
""The UAW presented its objectives to us and we talked about the objectives that we had and we found a way to address those within the pattern that was so important to the UAW,"" he said, adding that the deal allows GM to make competitive improvements.
The talks were said to hit several snags over the past week over several plants that GM wanted to exclude from the 95 percent employment guarantees. Among those were a door hinge plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that GM has put on the sale block.
The proposed exceptions to the pattern were aimed at allowing GM, the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, to cut costs and boost productivity.
Although all three of the companies pay a base wage of about $19 an hour, Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from lower-cost outside suppliers than GM does. GM wanted the ability to ""outsource"" more of its parts work.
Economic provisions of the GM contract were expected to follow those at Ford and Chrysler, offering workers a $2,000 bonus in the first year of the contract, followed by 3 percent increases in base wages during the second and third years.
The deal came as GM's production losses due to strikes at a metal stamping plant in Indianapolis and a truck plant in Janesville, Wis., mounted on Friday.
By late Friday, more than 19,000 workers at seven plants were idled, including 2,750 strikers in Indianapolis and 4,800 in Janesville.",0
"General Motors Corp. workers remained on the job without a contract Monday as United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich refrained -- for now -- from calling a strike against the auto giant.
Negotiations on a new national labor contract covering GM's 215,000 UAW hourly workers recessed early Monday after a midnight strike deadline passed. Yokich said some bargainers would resume talks later in the day.
""The only place you can settle these agreements is at the bargaining table,"" Yokich told a news conference early Monday. ""We feel that with or without a contract in place, we can continue (working). It's open-ended.""
The union plans to bring its plant-level leaders to Detroit for a meeting on the talks on Saturday, a move that typically comes after a tentative agreement is reached.
Although Yokich played down the threat of a strike on Monday, he said some of the more than 100 local unions at GM plants may resort to walkouts unless the automaker meets union demands in separate negtiations for local labor agreements.
The local talks have become a sticking point for the national negotiations, Yokich said, because only a few of the locals have signed agreements with GM.
The local pacts typically cover plant-specific issues such as work rules and health and safety standards, while the national contract covers wages, benefits, job security and other common issues.
""We decided that some of these locals need to work on these issues probably before we can ever get a settlement,"" Yokich said, declining to identify specific plants or issues.
Nevertheless, he urged anxious UAW members who watched their Canadian counterparts strike for three weeks this month to stay on the job for the time being.
""We hope that everyone understands that we can't do it in the street. It isn't weakness -- we have to do it at the bargaining table,"" he said.
Negotiations at GM's headquarters building here continued for 17 hours until about 2 a.m. EST on Monday, when bargainers began leaving, carrying their overnight bags.
Although some talks were scheduled to resume Monday afternoon, Yokich and other top UAW officers do not plan to return to the bargaining table until Tuesday morning.
In a written statement in response to Yokich's comments, GM Vice President of Personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive.
""We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues,"" Knechtel said.
Yokich chided GM's hard-headed negotiating style as ""typical GM,"" and noted that the union has consistently had a better relationship with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
The UAW wants GM to agree to the same job guarantees granted by Ford and Chrysler, which call for the two companies to guarantee employment for 95 percent of their combined 171,000 UAW members in the United States.
GM has 12 North American parts plants that it considers uncompetitive and wants to exclude several of those facilities from the job guarantee pledges, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.
Although GM is viewed as the least efficient of Detroit's Big Three automakers, Yokich insisted that the auto giant can live with the pattern.
""I think Ford and Chrysler understood when we said we're preparing ourselves and our union to enter the 21st Century with you as partners in the corporation,"" he said. ""I'm not too sure GM understands that. They've always been late bloomers. Maybe they'll get the message sooner or later.""
The UAW's strike threat comes less than a week after GM settled a 20-day strike by the independent Canadian Auto Workers union. The CAW struck over many of the same issues -- job security and shifting jobs to outside suppliers.
UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker said the U.S. union did not feel pressure to get the exact same provisions that GM agreed to in Canada.
GM's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $54 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"The president of the Canadian Auto Workers held out little hope on Friday for a quick end to a 10-day-old strike against General Motors Corp and said his counterparts at the United Auto Workers are having similar problems reaching a labor pact with the automaker.
Basil ""Buzz"" Hargrove told reporters in a conference call that GM is trying to resist the U.S. pattern agreement set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp, which guarantee employment levels at 95 percent of the companies' current hourly workforces.  
The provision is aimed at curbing the automakers' ability to shift work to outside suppliers, known as outsourcing, which also is the major sticking point in the CAW talks.
""I'd be quite happy if Steve were to get a settlement,"" Hargrove said of UAW President Stephen Yokich. ""He's having the same problem -- getting the pattern agreement with GM.""
He said GM has ""agreed to the principle of limiting the outsourcing"" in the U.S."", but doesn't want to meet the 95 percent employment guarantee and wants to exclude parts plants it has on sale from the guarantee.  
Talks between the UAW and GM have been low key during the Canadian strike. Negotiators have met only during normal business hours and do not plan to meet over the weekend.
UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to characterize progress of the discussions, only to say bargainers were ""down to the larger issues.""
But Hargrove has not asked Yokich to delay a U.S. settlement with GM during the Canadian strike.
The CAW launched an escalating strike on October 3 and all the union's 26,000 GM workers were on the picket line by midnight on Wednesday.  
The UAW has about 215,000 U.S. hourly workers at GM and, so far, only about 2,000 have been idled at an engine plant and a transmission plant.
The strike may affect some of GM's U.S. plants next week, although the automaker canceled most overtime work this week.
Hargrove said he saw no progress in talks with the automaker.
""I don't want to kid anybody,"" he said. ""It hasn't been very productive last few days, I do not believe it will be productive today.""
Hargrove wanted the Canadian walkout to have as little effect on GM's U.S. production as possible so as to protect UAW workers and the profit-sharing checks they expect to receive this year. Prolonged shutdowns in the U.S. due to lack of Canadian-made parts could seriously hurt GM's profits and reduce profit sharing for employees.",0
"Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers union were back at the bargaining table on Saturday in an effort to reach a new national labor agreement before a Sunday night strike deadline.
Bargainers, led by UAW President Stephen Yokich, reconvened about 8 a.m. (noon GMT) at GM's Detroit headquarters following a night off after the union's decision late on Friday to cancel its contract with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday).
The deadline marks the first time the UAW threatened a strike in its 1996 negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, which up to now have been marked by an unusually conciliatory tone and extremely secretive discussions.
It also came days after GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday following a three-week strike against the automaker's Canadian operations.
In the U.S. talks the two sides were at odds over the same issues that caused the walkout in Canada -- the union's demand for job security and GM's desire to sell several parts plants and maintain flexibility to shift components work to outside suppliers, a practice known as outsourcing.
In the U.S. negotiations GM wanted to modify the UAW contract pattern set by Ford   Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., which agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their UAW  workforces over the next three years.
GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, wanted to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees, including a door-hardware plant in Flint, Michigan, and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Michigan.
Ford and Chrysler buy more of their parts from outside suppliers than GM does, often from firms that paid their workers significantly less than the $19-an-hour base wage paid in Big Three factories.
Yokich said in a statment Friday that he was not optimistic that a deal could be reached before the deadline, but told workers to remain on the job until further notice.
On Saturday UAW spokesman Reg McGhee declined to say whether the union was still pessimistic about the talks.
""That was yesterday's statement,"" McGhee said. ""We're just saying that the talks are continuing and we're not characterizing the progress.""
GM spokesman Charles Licari said the automaker was prepared for round-the-clock negotiations, but declined to provide further details of the talks.
GM's chief negotiator, Gerald Knechtel, said Friday that the automaker was ""committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness.""
GM flush with $14 billion in cash on its balance sheet and operating earnings that more than doubled in the third quarter to $1 billion, showed much willingness this year to sustain costly strikes in its continued quest for competitiveness.
Industry analysts estimated the cost of the Canadian strike at $150 million to $450 million, while a 17-day strike at two Dayton, Ohio, brake plants in March reduced GM's first quarter profit by $900 million.
In Dayton, GM preserved its right to buy a future brake system from an outside supplier, while in Canada, GM won the right to sell two parts plants in return for recognizing some limits on outsourcing.
But the effects of the Canadian strike continued to linger last week, as more of GM's U.S. assembly plants plants ran out of Canadian-made parts.
In Flint, Michigan, local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday.
The facility makes Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, as well as V-6 engines and other components.
On Thursday GM laid off about 5,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in a shutdown scheduled to last two weeks. The plant builds the popular Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars.
Also on Friday GM notified some of the 2,926 workers at the nearby Lordstown metal stamping plant they would be idled next week. Another 474 workers at a components plant in Vandalia, Ohio, will be idled next week, GM said.
Excluding the layoffs that will start next week, GM said it had a total of 23,340 workers idled in the United States and Mexico on Friday.",0
"Boosting the pressure on General Motors Corp. for a new labour agreement, the United Auto Workers union Friday set a Sunday night deadline for a strike against the world's largest automaker.
UAW President Stephen Yokich said in a statment that union negotiators were not optimistic that a new contract deal could be reached by the deadline of 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0459 GMT Monday).
While he did not say if the union's 215,000 GM hourly workers would actually strike, Yokich said the UAW had notified GM that it will terminate its extended 1993 contract with the automaker if the deadline passes with no agreement. The union typically does not work without a contract.
""UAW members have been advised to continue to work unless notified by their local union,"" Yokich said.
""The UAW bargaining team will continue to make serious efforts to achieve a new agreement. While we are not optimistic, we remain hopeful that this can be accomplished prior to the expiration of the current contract at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday,"" he added.
The move comes just three days after GM settled a contentious, 20-day strike with the Canadian Auto Workers union that caused parts shortages that are still forcing the auto giant to shut down some U.S. assembly plants.
Although the UAW talks had been moving quickly before the strike in Canada, people close to the negotiations said the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand for employment guarantees and GM's desire for flexibility to shift more parts work to outside, usually non-union suppliers.
Both Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. have agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current work forces over the next three years. GM has resisted the pattern, saying it wants to exclude certain components plants from the employment guarantees.
A GM spokesman said full-scale UAW negotiations at GM's Detroit headquarters will continue throughout the weekend for the first time since the strike in Canada began on Oct. 2.
In a statement, GM chief negotiator Gerald Knechtel said, ""We remain committed to entering into agreement that balances the needs of our employees and the UAW with the flexibility GM needs to continue to improve our competitiveness.""
""We've had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since the talks began and we're hopeful we can focus with the UAW on concluding these negotiations as soon as possible.""
Meanwhile, GM continued to run out of Canadian-made parts at U.S. assembly plants. In Flint, Mich., local UAW officials said GM told more than 6,600 workers not to report to work at the automaker's massive Buick City complex on Monday.
The facility makes Buick LeSabre, Oldsmobile 88 and Pontiac Bonneville sedans, as well as V-6 engines and other components.
Buick City is the largest of several facilities to cut back production due to shortages of parts following the end of the Canadian Auto Workers' strike this week.
On Thursday, GM laid off about 5,000 workers at its Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in a shutdown that will last two weeks. The plant builds the popular Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire small cars.

GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after they ratified a new contract that puts some limits GM's ability to shift work to outside suppliers but allows the automaker to sell two contested parts plants.",0
"Negotiators for General Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers adjourned their talks on Saturday evening with less than 30 hours to go before a midnight Sunday strike deadline.
Bargainers, led by UAW President Stephen Yokich, took their second consecutive night off since the union announced on Friday that it will cancel its contract with the automaker at 11:59 p.m. EST Sunday (0359 GMT on Monday).
GM spokesman Charles Licari declined to say whether the adjournment was a sign of poor progress in the talks aimed at a new national labour agreement covering the automaker's 215,000 UAW workers. Typically bargaining runs around the clock when a settlement is near.
The deadline marks the first time the UAW has threatened a strike in its 1996 negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers, which up to now have been marked by an unusually conciliatory tone and extremely secretive discussions.
It also came two days after GM's 26,000 Canadian Auto Workers members began returning to work on Wednesday after a three-week strike against the automaker's Canadian operations.

"Lear Corp., furthering its quest to supply complete car interiors, said Friday it agreed to buy the instrument panel and trim parts unit of Denmark-based Borealis Holding AB.
Lear said it signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire Borealis Industrier AB for undisclosed terms.
Based in Gothenburg, Sweden, Borealis Industrier manufacturers instrument panels, door panels, climate systems, exterior trim and various other components for the European car and truck industry.
Borealis Industrier had 1995 sales of about $230 million and owns five plants in Sweden that employ about 1,800 people.
Primary customers for the business include Swedish carmakers AB Volvo and Saab Automobile AB and truckmaker Scania AB.
Borealis Holding is owned by Finnish state-controlled oil and energy group Neste Oy and Norwegian state-owned oil group Statoil AS.
Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by the Swedish competition authority and other conditions.
Lear said the acquisition supports its strategy of having in-house capability to provide total automotive interior systems, including instrument panels.
""Not only does this acquisition strengthen relations with our European customers, but it positions Lear as the only independent automotive supplier in the world with in-house capabilities in all five interior systems -- broadening the appeal of our already strong one-stop-shopping competitive advantage,"" Lear Chairman Kenneth Way said in a statement.
The deal is the latest of a series of consolidation moves in the automotive interior market. Lear earlier this year purchased carpet and floor-mat maker Masland Corp. for $384 million, and last year bought door panel and console maker Automotive Industries Inc for $626 million.
Lear's U.S. operations include the manufacturing of a wide range of automotive interior components.
The company's stock was unchanged Friday at $38 a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
Lear's competitors are also pursuing the same acquisition strategy.
Johnson Controls Inc., which has a strong seating business, recently acquired interior parts maker Prince Automotive, based in Holland Mich., for $1.35 billion in cash.
Canada's Magna International Inc., one of the ""Big Three"" automotive interior firms along with Lear and Johnson Controls, recently acquired seat maker Douglas & Lomason Co. for $135 million.",0
"A midnight Sunday strike deadline for General Motors Corp expired without a walkout as talks between the car maker and the United Auto Workers continued into the early morning hours on Monday.
A GM spokesman declined to provide further details of the negotiations, saying the automaker would make a more detailed statement later on Monday morning.
""They're still on the job,"" said Norman Harp, a union commiteeman for UAW Local 14 at GM's Toledo, Ohio, transmission plant, which started its third shift shortly before midnight Sunday.
""The deadline's here and gone and they're still talking,"" Harp said of the negotiators at GM's Detroit headquarters.
Local UAW officials at other GM plants also said they were told to stand by for further instructions.
The UAW cancelled its national contract covering 215,000 GM hourly workers one minute before midnight Sunday in a move to increase pressure on GM for tentative agreement.
However, there was speculation among UAW officials late Sunday that instead of a national strike, the union could strike selected plants that make GM's high-profit light trucks. Top on the list of such facilities were GM's Janesville, Wis., plant, which makes Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Suburban full-size sport/utility vehicles, and the Pontiac, Mich., plant, which makes GM's popular full-size pickup trucks with extended cabs.
A selective strike at those facilities would inflict pain on GM while minimizing the drain on the UAW's strike fund, which pays each UAW worker $150 a week. It also would blunt some of the political fallout from a massive strike close to the U.S. presidential election.
UAW officials say the two sides remain at odds over the union's demand that GM follow the pattern set at Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp by guaranteeing employment for 95 percent of its current UAW workforce.
GM, which has 12 parts plants that it considers uncompetitive, wants to exclude several of those facilities from the guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich., that it wants to sell.
In settling the Canadian strike last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the selling of two parts plants in Windsor and Oshawa, Ontario and retained some flexibility to outsource more products. However, GM agreed to guarantee pensions for workers in the two plants or up to nine years and to allow them to transfer back to jobs that open up in other GM facilities.
GM still has more than 20,000 workers in the United States and Mexico idled because of lingering parts shortages associated with the Canadian strike.",0
"Investors pushed General Motors Corp. shares higher Monday, a sign that Wall Street is pleased that the auto giant signed a new national labour agreement that allows it to shed some workers.
GM's shares traded up $1.50 at $55.50 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the company signed the tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union early Saturday morning.
""The Wall Street reaction reflects some belief that GM didn't cave in,"" said Burnham Securities auto analyst David Healy. ""GM appears to have retained its right to manage and indulge in some outsourcing.""
Analysts said the pact will allow GM to reduce its 215,000-member hourly work force by 30,000 or more during the next three years through normal retirements.
The pact contains a nominal guarantee that GM maintain employment of about 95 percent of its current work force -- a pattern set in the Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. agreements -- but it also allows GM to exit some unprofitable parts businesses and sell certain components plants.
David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation, said he believes the pact will help GM to to boost efficiency.
""GM can use attrition to shrink its work force and take advantage of productivity improvements,"" Cole said. ""The UAW has as much interest in a competitive General Motors as the shareholders do.""
But the positive reaction was tempered by a continuing strike at GM's Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant, where 4,809 workers walked off the job Oct. 29 over demands for more jobs.
The plant makes the Chevrolet Tahoe, Suburban and GMC Yukon sport/utilities, which are among GM's most popular -- and most profitable -- vehicles. UAW Local 95 wants GM to hire more workers in Janesville to reduce the strain of heavy overtime and an increasing workload.
On Sunday, members of UAW Local 23 returned to work at a key metal stamping plant in Indianapolis after ratifying a settlement on a new local contract.
The union members had struck for five days, shutting off shipments of fenders, doors, hoods and other steel body panels to nine of GM's 11 North American light truck assembly plants.
By the weekend, strike-caused parts shortages forced GM to shut down factories in Fort Wayne, Ind., Shreveport, La., Moraine, Ohio, and Linden, N.J.
GM said the Fort Wayne and Moraine plants are scheduled to resume normal operations Tuesday, while Shreveport and Linden will be running again by Thursday.
Last week, the UAW walkouts and lingering parts shortages from last month's Canadian Auto Workers strike had idled nearly 38,000 GM workers in the United States.
GM did not say how many workers were still idle, but added that four car plants stricken by the CAW strike will be back to full production by Tuesday, including Detroit; Lordstown, Ohio; and Lake Orion and Lansing, Mich.
Healy estimated that between the two walkouts, GM's production losses will total 175,000 cars and trucks, which will slash the company's fourth-quarter profits by $600 million to $650 million.
In contrast to the tense atmosphere that continues to surround the GM labour situation, UAW President Stephen Yokich and Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton signed a new three-year contract in an historic ceremony at the union's Detroit headquarters.
The signing marked the first time that a Big Three automaker has signed a new labour accord at the UAW's Solidarity House.
Yokich and Eaton were in a jovial mood as they signed the pact -- a stark contrast to the separate, grim-faced news conferences where the UAW and GM announced their deal early Saturday morning.
Yokich told reporters the Chrysler signing ""shows that this company recognises the union and wants to work with them.""
Meanwhile, GM declared an unchanged quarterly dividend of 40 cents a share on its $1-2/3 par value common stock.
Some analysts had expected GM's board of directors to increase the annual payout to $2 a share from $1.60 because of its growing cash pile. But Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi said the board did not want to disrupt the UAW pact's ratification by giving more cash to shareholders.",0
"Japan's financial industry is gradually recovering from the bad-debt hangover left by the economic ""bubble"" years, but the pain lingers on for smaller banks and loan institutions.
Analysts say the industry has got over the worst of the bad loan mess after vigorous efforts by the government and major banks over the past year to tackle the problem. Any further serious damage to the system is therefore unlikely, they say.
But the picture is darker for small institutions that lack the financial might of the big banks but were similarly saddled with soured loans from the late 1980s lending boom.
Analysts say it will take years to restore confidence in the banking sector given the lingering problems and exposure to the troubled real estate and construction industries.
The nervousness was highlighted last month by the collapse of financing firm Nichiei Finance Co Ltd with huge debt liabilities, and revelations of losses at a regional bank because of suspected misuse of funds by an ex-employee.
Both these incidents jolted financial markets. In the case of Biwako Bank, the markets were unsettled by vague rumours of dire trouble before the bank said it had lost money due to the suspected misappropration but remained in sound health.
A new restructuring programme unveiled two weeks ago by Tobishima Corp, a contractor and engineering company, also fuelled concerns that banks would face new burdens as ailing firms seek further support while trying to reshape themselves.
Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said the banks are dealing with the problem in stages -- first with their own bad loans, then the problems of affiliated firms and, finally, the issue of other debtors.
""Banks are trying to dispose of problem loans to independent non-banks after mostly completing write-offs of debt held by their non-bank affiliates,"" he said.
Failures of troubled non-banks are already anticipated and it may take one or two years for the big banks to fully recover from the mess, he said.
Non-banks are financial firms which do not take deposits but rely mostly on loans from banks and other deposit-taking bodies such as agricultural credit cooperatives.
Like the ""jusen"" mortgage firms, which were wound up this year, many non-banks are in trouble. They lent to golf-course and resort companies that joined hands with developers looking for easy profits during the free-wheeling ""bubble"" years.
When asset prices began to plunge in the early 1990s, many firms which had relied on borrowed funds for investments were unable to repay the money, causing a ripple effect of bad debt.
The Finance Ministry said this week that outstanding loans by Japan's 249 non-banks fell 4.4 percent to 50.74 trillion yen ($449 billion) at the end of March from a year earlier.
Analysts said Nichiei's main creditors -- Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB), Asahi Bank and the Bank of Yokohama -- are expected to give up their claims after the company filed for restructuring under court guidance, a category of business failure under Japan's bankruptcy laws.
As of March, DKB had 56 billion yen ($495 million) ($495 million) in loans to Nichiei Finance, while Asahi had 32 billion yen ($283 million) and Bank of Yokohama 20 billion yen ($176 million) in loans, they said.
James Fiorillo, a ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst, said the amount these three write off for Nichiei will only be about a fifth of their total disposals this fiscal year.
DKB has predicted an operating profit for 1996/97 to next March of about 320 billion yen ($2.83 billion) and current profit, a form of pre-tax profit including non-operating activities, of 40 billion yen ($353 million). This suggests DKB may use the difference -- 280 billion yen ($2.47 billion) -- to write off problem loans.
Japan's 20 big banks are already planning to dispose of 3.5 trillion yen ($30.9 billion) to 4.0 trillion yen ($35.3 billion) of problem loans in 1996/97 after writing off nearly 11 trillion yen ($97.3 billion) in 1995/96, analysts estimated.
It will, however, take some time for creditor banks to solve the problem of the non-banks including Nichiboshin Ltd and Apollo Leasing Co Ltd.
The search for a solution is complicated by the fact that the non-banks are part of a web of lending, having borrowed from more than 100 creditors including financially weak agricultural credit unions.",0
"Japan's major commercial banks on Friday said they had returned to the black in the first half of the current business year after many of them posted losses in the previous fiscal year.
Analysts said that aggressive problem loan write-offs in the second half of the previous fiscal year which ended in March led to the losses after the 10 banks posted record profits in the first-half of that business year.
They added the results were close to the previous earnings' forecasts made by the biggest banks, showing that the banks are on schedule in steadily writing off their problem loans.
""The earnings results in the first half of the last business year were extraordinarily good...Interest rates were falling and anybody could earn profits if they sold bonds,"" said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre.
""While operating profits have declined from a year earlier, the business environment is not bad due to the low interest rates, and they will probably post handsome profits for the whole business year,"" he said.
Many of the big banks had losses in the previous business year due to the massive disposal of problem loans, including those to failed ""jusen"" mortgage firms, he said.
The 10 banks said that combined operating profits -- profits from the banking business before loan loss provisions -- totalled 1.19 trillion yen ($10.7 billion) in the first half, down from 1.87 trillion yen ($16.8 billion) a year earlier.
Combined parent current profits -- pre-tax profit including losses and gains on investments -- totalled 391.9 billion yen ($3.53 billion) in the first half, down from 463.2 billion yen ($4.17 billion) a year earlier.
Sasajima said the 10 banks had projected 1.16 trillion yen ($10.4 billion) in combined operating profits and 334 billion yen ($3.00 billion) in combined parent current profits.
Some of the bankers, however, remained cautious.
Akishige Okada, senior managing director at Sakura Bank Ltd, told reporters that a narrowing in the loan spread, which was a main reason for the decline in operating profits, was likely to continue in the second half of the year to March 31.
""I expect the business environment will not be so good, as the current interest rate situation is not expected to change in the latter half,"" Okada said.
The loan spread is the spread between the rates paid on deposits and for other fund-raising, and the rates charged on lending. Japan's interest rates fell to record low levels in the last fiscal year and have remained there.
Of the 10 banks,  Hokkaido Takushoku, Sakura, Fuji, Daiwa, Sanwa, Tokai and Asahi posted current losses in 1995/96.
The 10 banks -- including the Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank which merged into the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi on April 1, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and Sumitomo Bank -- disposed of 6.31 trillion yen ($56.8 billion) worth of problem loans in 1995/96.
Bankers said that they would continue to dispose of problem loans in the latter half of 1996/97 after doing so in the first half by setting aside loan-loss provisions and selling them to a joint problem loan liquidation body.",0
"The Tokyo stock market's recent falls offer a preview of the pain Japan's life insurance industry will face as a result of greater competition from planned ""Big Bang"" financial reforms, industry sources say.
The fall in share prices means some of the insurance companies may have to post losses in the business year to March 31, increasing an already wide gap in financial strength between big and small firms, the sources said.
But the real threat is expected intense competition from other financial sectors such as banking after the Big Bang.
""The Big Bang is the real threat, as it means fierce competition among all financial sectors, including banks and Western asset management firms,"" said an executive at a major life insurance firm.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled plans in November to liberalise Japan's financial markets by 2001 under the Big Bang reforms, in which banks, brokers and insurance companies will be allowed to enter each other's turf.
In the past, Japan's life insurance industry enjoyed spectacular growth as the nation's economic success enabled people to plan for the long-term financial security of their families, analysts said.
But with the maturing of the core life insurance product market, big insurers are focusing on asset management.
The life insurers are already facing increased competition after a revision to the law governing them allowed 11 non-life insurers to set up life insurance subsidiaries last October, raising to 44 the number of life insurers in Japan.
A spokesman for Sony Life Insurance, a subsidiary of Sony Corp, said there were also concerns about how far the big commercial banks would be permitted to enter the insurance business under the Big Bang reforms.
Koya Hasegawa, an analyst at Nikko Research Center, said the life insurance industry needed to increase its efficiency, particularly to fight off a challenge from the banks.
The reforms are expected to allow over-the-counter sales of insurance policies by banks, he said.
But even before that, some life insurers are in for a tough time. ""If stocks remain under pressure until the end of the current business year they will see unrealised profits on their shareholdings wiped out, forcing them to post losses,"" Nikko Research's Hasegawa said.
Falling stock prices reduce their unrealised profits on shareholdings. These unrealised profits are a source of funds to cover sudden losses and write-offs of problem loans and make up for negative spreads between low investment yields and already promised payouts.
The payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.
If the Nikkei average of 225 leading shares is around 19,000 on March 31, when the companies close their books for 1996/97, unrealised profits on shareholdings at three life insurers -- Toho Mutual Life, Nissan Mutual Life and Kyoei Life -- will be wiped out, the sources said.
A Nikkei fall to 18,000 would make the unrealised profits at Tokyo Mutual Life, Nippon Dantai Life and Daihyaku Mutual Life disappear, while the crucial level is 17,000 for Sumitomo Life and Chiyoda Mutual Life, they said.
On Thursday, the Nikkei closed down 471.26 points at 17,864.04. But on Friday morning the index bounced back, rising 570.68 points by midday.
Chiyoda, Nissan, Kyoei, Tokyo, Nippon Dantai, and Daihyaku all posted before-tax current losses in the year to March 31, 1995. Toho also did so, for the second straight year.",0
"Japan will set up a panel on Tuesday to tackle the after-effects of the nation's problem loans -- collection of bad loans in the form of land collateral, government sources said on Monday.
The panel will discuss wide-ranging steps to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans, a government source said.
""The central issue for the panel will be studying measures to collect problem loans in the form of land collateral run up by (failed) 'jusen' mortgage firms,""  he said.
""We think securitisation of the problem loans is one effective measure to collect problem loans,"" he also said.
Officials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency will join the panel, along with officials from the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan, a semi-governmental body set up to protect depositors from bank failures.
The Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC), in charge of recovering the problem loans of failed mortgage firms, known as ""jusen"", and the Resolution and Collection Bank (RCB), which will perform a similar task for troubled credit unions, will also send officials to join the panel.
Officials are now finally aware they must take steps to stimulate the real estate market from a budgetary standpoint, said Yoshinobu Yamada, analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan.
HLAC was set up in July to recover the problem loans of seven failed mortgage firms over the next 15 years. But the government says further losses may arise and that half of any future losses will be covered by public money.
In June, the government adopted a controversial scheme that allows for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.17 billion) in taxpayers' money to help wind up the failed mortgage firms.
The government has also committed itself to meeting any potential shortfalls at the Resolution and Collection Bank with government funds.
The bank was established last month to manage the holdings of failed credit unions and collect their problem loans. The government has given the bank a 10-year period to bail out credit unions and aims to disband the bank thereafter.
Some analysts said, however, that it would be tough for the ministries to agree on steps to boost the sagging real estate market, now in a five-year-long slump following the bursting of the 1980s ""bubble economy"" of inflated asset prices.
For instance, Japan may have to allocate budget funds for public utilisation of assets put up as collateral for problem loans, analysts said. The government should also adopt a flexible taxation system to help securitise problem loans backed by real estate, they said.
Securitising the loans involves selling property to a new special-purpose company, which in turn will issue bonds backed by these assets to procure money. Investors in the bonds would profits from any rise in land prices and from rent income.
The number of investors in Japan is still limited due to fears of further drops in land prices, and financial institutions themselves are reluctant to sell collateralised land at the currently cheap market prices, analysts said.
But Yukiko Ohara, an analyst at UBS Securities, said the setting up of a panel to discuss this dilemma is an important first step. ""It is better than nothing.""",0
"One year after its dramatic expulsion from the United States, scandal-hit Daiwa Bank is finding its misfortune may in some ways have been a blessing in disguise, analysts say.
The painful fall-out from its $1.1 billion bond-trading loss in the United States, they say, forced the bank to take some of the bitter but necessary restructuring measures that other Japanese banks have been reluctant to swallow.
""Following its expulsion from the United States and inspections by Japan""s Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan, Daiwa was able to eliminate management risks from its corporate structure,"" said Yukiko Ohara, a financial analyst at UBS Securities Ltd.
""It (Daiwa) could be a model for restructuring at other banks, which still lack a sense of crisis despite the recent fall in their share prices,"" she said.
By the end of March, 2000, Daiwa""s restructuring efforts are likely to help boost its annual operating profits above 100 billion yen ($800 million), despite the negative impact of asset reductions overseas, Ohara said. In the year to March 1997 Daiwa forecast operating profits of 80 billion yen ($640 million).
A Daiwa official agreed that the harm done by the bond-loss scandal was not as great as initially expected.
""We feared that we might suffer substantial damage from the withdrawal from U.S. markets,"" Daiwa bank director Akiyoshi Otani told Reuters in a recent interview. ""But the damage was not great.... Our customers stayed calm and have been supporting us.""
""The strategies we have taken (since the withdrawal from the United States) have not been wrong,"" he added.
In November 1995, two months after news broke that a Daiwa trader in New York lost $1.1 billion on unauthorised deals, U.S. bank regulatory authorities ordered Daiwa to shut down its U.S. operations. Daiwa pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy and fraud and paid a record $340 million in fines.
Japan""s Finance Ministry also placed temporary restrictions on Daiwa""s operations and ordered the institution, Japan""s ninth largest commercial bank, to work out a drastic streamlining programme.
Last April, Daiwa announced a two-year plan to focus on its three strengths: the Kansai area around Osaka in western Japan, where it has a strong customer base, the Asian market, and the trust business, which includes pension fund management. Daiwa manages more pension fund money than any other Japanese bank.
It also decided to shut about 36 offices, including 16 overseas, by March 1999, and by the end of last September had cut its assets to 16.30 trillion yen ($130 billion) from 19.36 trillion yen ($154 billion) a year earlier. Daiwa also plans to reduce the number of its employees by about 2,000 by March 2000, from 9,151 last September.
But some analysts insisted the bank""s restructuring had not gone far enough, noting it was still saddled with 790 billion yen ($6.32 billion) in problem loans, or 7.4 percent of loans outstanding, as of last September.
Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc""s Tokyo branch, added that the expulsion from the United States was bound to damage Daiwa""s future business.
""I doubt whether Daiwa can continue to manage its international business without U.S. operations,"" he said. ""The business environment surrounding Japanese banks will become much tougher and Daiwa must make extra efforts to streamline its business, even halving its assets.""
Several analysts have suggested that Daiwa""s woes may force it to combine with another financial institution. Last month, Moody""s Investors Service said Daiwa Bank and Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder, may join under the same holding company.
But Daiwa""s Otani dismissed such talk for now.
""We should not forget that we are still in the process of recovering our creditworthiness.... Although there is talk about mergers or a holding company, this is not an issue for us at the moment,"" he said. ($=125 yen)",0
"Japanese banks, still struggling under the weight of massive problem loans, now face tough decisions on how to adapt to expected structural changes to the country's economy and financial system, analysts say.
They say it is inevitable the banks will need to shift their focus towards creating new business and offering specific services to boost profits as demand for loans weakens.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's ""Big Bang"" financial reform plans unveiled last month to liberalise Japan's financial markets by 2001 will also accelerate competition.
""To increase profitability, Japanese banks must change the sources of their profits,"" said Koyo Ozeki, a director at international credit rating agency IBCA Ltd.
On Thursday, the Finance Ministry announced sweeping plans to deregulate Japan's foreign exchange market in 1998.
Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, warned that Japanese banks will face intensified competition as a result of the deregulation.
""I hope Japanese financial institutions will be well prepared for severe competition in the future,"" he said.
Tight regulation, dating back to the end of World War Two, has protected Japanese banks from competition and has made them less efficient than Western rivals, analysts say.
And because of that, some analysts such as Shinji Okabe, senior credit officer at rating agency Moody's Japan, are pessimistic about the future of Japanese banks.
""It seems to me that Japanese banks cannot judge which business is profitable... It looks like the banks all think they can do everything with unlimited resources,"" he said.
Since the early 1990s, Japanese banks have written off problem loans resulting from their adventurous lending policies in the late 1980 ""bubble economy"" of inflated asset prices.
But as of the end of September, 20 major banks were still carrying 23 trillion yen ($201 billion) worth of problem loans.
Analysts say it will take two more years on average for the top 20 banks to cut the loans to manageable levels, giving foreign banks further chances to to nudge into the market.
""Foreign banks have expanded and strengthened their business base in the past decade, but Japanese banks were not able to do anything because they had to dispose of the problem loans,"" said IBCA's Ozeki.
Japan's 20 biggest banks, down from 21 after a merger in April between Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank, posted 22.85 trillion yen ($200 billion) in parent operating profits in an eight-year period to the end of March this year.
During that time they also disposed of 21.7 trillion yen ($190 billion) in problem loans, Ozeki said.
Even profitability at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which many analysts agree is the strongest Japanese candidate to become an internationally competitive bank, is low.
The bank's return on equity, a gauge to show the efficiency of the use of capital, is only about 7.2 percent, compared with Barclays Plc's 13.09 percent and Bankers Trust's 18.32 percent, an IBCA study showed.
Analysts say they expect more bank failures in Japan, particularly among smaller regional banks and credit unions.
In November, Japanese authorities ordered the regional Hanwa Bank to halt business, the third regional bank failure since the end of World War Two. Eleven smaller credit unions and associations have also gone under since December 1994.
Analysts said uncertainty over how to deal with troubled banks has not been entirely removed in Japan, and there remains some concern that larger and stronger banks may be drawn into the support mechanism at some cost to themselves.
Japanese banks to which Moody's has given a bank financial strength rating (BFSR) of ""E"" are financially weak, Okabe said.
Chuo Trust & Banking and Yasuda Trust & Banking, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank are the E rated banks.",0
"Overseas subsidiaries of Japan's top brokerage, Nomura Securities Co Ltd, virtually doubled their combined profits in the half year to September, energised by strong earnings in Europe.
An official of Nomura told Reuters its 66 subsidiaries abroad made a total of 17.7 billion yen ($158 million) in pre-tax profit in the six months, the first half of Japan's fiscal year, almost double the approximately nine billion yen ($80.36 million) in the same period a year earlier.
The main reason was a more than five-fold profit surge at Nomura's European subsidiaries, while results in the Asian and American regions were generally flat, the official said in a telephone interview.
Nomura released its half-year parent and group earnings results on Tuesday but did not give details of earnings in the regions.  Despite the buoyant business overseas, the brokerage tipped into the red on a parent and a group net basis after deciding to put large sums of money into helping an ailing financial affiliate.
In the business year that ended on March 31, 1996, pre-tax profits at Nomura's consolidated subsidiaries overseas totalled 47.1 billion yen ($420 million).
In the April-September period, European subsidiaries led by London-based Nomura International Plc posted current profits of 9.8 billion yen ($87.5 million), more than five times the amount a year earlier, the official said.
Hitoshi Tonomura, a new chairman who arrived at Nomura International in London in the spring of last year, helped to bring operations there back into profit, he said.
Current profits at Asian units were 1.5 billion yen ($13.3 million), slightly up from a year earlier, while those at subsidiaries in the American region totalled 6.4 billion yen ($57.1 million), little changed from a year earlier, he said.
The official said successful asset securitisation business by Nomura International fuelled the sharp increase in the profits there, and profits in the United States came largely from the asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities business.
As for business in Asia, he said: ""We are still in the stage of investment and not getting returns yet, although we are allocating our human and other resources there.""
Nomura used to announce its group results about a month after the parent earnings but has brought the group statement forward to provide more timely information for investors.
In the first half, it posted parent current profit of 69.87 billion yen ($623 million), while group current profit stood at 74.76 billion yen. However, it posted a hefty half-year net loss on both a parent and consolidated basis after providing financial support of 37.1 billion yen ($331 million) for an ailing non-bank financial affiliate in the Nomura group.
The parent net loss was 337.54 billion yen ($3.01 billion) and the group net loss 332.01 billion yen ($2.96 billion).
Current profit is pre-tax, and includes losses and gains on non-operating activities. Net profit is after-tax and includes extraordinary profits or losses.",0
"Japan, worried about being isolated in global capital markets, is working to harmonise its domestic accounting standards with international methods.
Finance Ministry (MOF) officials and analysts say Japan must comply with international accounting methods amid growing criticism that it is difficult to calculate how much risk a Japanese firm holds.
""To raise funds in international capital markets, financial statements of Japanese firms must be accepted by foreign investors,"" said an official in MOF's securities bureau.
Naruaki Sonoda, Nikko Research Centre's senior analyst, says: ""It is needed to harmonise Japanese standards with international ones as it is costly for Japanese firms which want to raise funds overseas to have to make two financial statements based on domestic and international standards.""
Last month, an advisory body to the ministry started a two-year discussion into whether and how far mark-to-market accounting should be used for companies' financial products holdings, such as securities and derivatives, as well as corporate pension fund accounts.
In mark-to-market accounting, unrealised gains or losses from financial products holdings must be stated in balance sheets and included in income statements.
In Japan, financial products are fundamentally appraised according to the cost of purchase, and only realised gains or losses need to be posted when positions are closed, regardless of the size of the open position a corporation is holding.
Growing financial assets at Japanese corporations and a series of trading fiascos by Japanese firms in the past year has prompted Japanese authorities to set tougher accounting rules.
At the end of March 1995, securities holdings at Japanese corporations, excluding financial industries, totalled 50.11 trillion yen ($463 billion) based on book value, accounting for 16 percent of their total assets, NRC's Sonoda said.
This compared with 21.15 trillion yen ($195 billion) of securities holdings at the end of March 1985, which accounted for 11 percent of their total assets.
Huge losses stemming from securities and derivatives trading have raised criticism for lax Japanese corporate risk management and accounting methods.
Earlier this year, Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp announced it had lost $1.8 billion through unauthorised trading in copper futures.
Last November, Daiwa Bank said it lost $1.1 billion in unauthorised bond trading at its now-closed New York office.
The MOF also announced last month that it would tighten rules on corporate disclosure, highlighting that corporations will have to disclose unlisted derivatives trading such as swap trading, based on market prices, beginning in April 1998.
Listed derivatives, which are already calculated at market values, cover futures and options traded at the securities exchanges. Unlisted derivatives include swap trading such as interest-rate swaps.
The new rules do not affect corporate balance sheets, but disclosing the data is a step towards introducing mark-to-market accounting for financial products holdings.
Japan is working toward using international standards, said Hirokazu Moriyama, general manager at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities & Economics.
""I expect Japan to introduce international accounting standards by the end of the fiscal 1998/1999, as the European Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States have stated their support for the IASC process in setting international accounting standards,"" Moriyama said.
IASC, the International Accounting Standards Committee, has been working out principles of international accounting rules that can be applied in consistent ways in different countries.
It is expected to complete the process by March 1998.
The International Organisation of Securities Commissions, comprised of governmental securities authorities, including Japan, decided in July last year that it would take steps towards accepting IASC accountancy proposals.
Sonoda said, however, it was still unclear how far Japan would go in adopting mark-to-market methods in securities holdings and derivatives trading.
The United States basically uses the mark-to-market appraisal for securities holdings.
Sonoda says if international accounting standards follow the U.S. method, the impact would be enormous on Japanese corporations.
""Japanese companies own huge amounts of stocks in unique cross holdings, and they have massive unrealised profits on those holdings as they bought the shares a long time ago at cheap prices.""
If those hidden profits are appraised in balance sheets, the boost in assets would deteriorate the return on equity (ROE) at Japanese companies.
ROE is a common financial yardstick, showing how efficiently a company is using its capital.
""This may reveal how poorly Japanese companies make use of shareholders' capital..."" Sonoda said.
Currently, the ROE for Japanese companies is about 3.8 percent, compared with more than 10 percent for U.S. companies.",0
"Japan's rule-bound markets must be fully deregulated to ensure that the nation does not fall further behind in the global finance business, an influential reform panel said on Thursday in an interim report.
Establishing markets to effectively manage 1,000 trillion yen ($8.92 trillion) of individual assets through deregulation is particularly important ahead of a rapid rise in the proportion of old people, key panel member Kazuhito Ikeo said.
""Unless Japan speeds up restructuring of the financial system, it will be left behind in global competition even more than now, particularly asset management services,"" Ikeo, a professor at Keio University in Tokyo, told reporters.
The proposal includes abolition of all rules on the range of businesses which units of banks and brokers are allowed to engage in by the end of fiscal 1997/98 year in March.
It also recommended a fundamental revision in the Securities and Exchange Law and liberalisation of commissions on stockbroking, as well as lifting an almost 50-year ban on holding companies, which control one or more companies, often through a majority stake.
Ikeo said the panel, made up of private-sector figures and academics, focused on benefits for consumers and put aside an expected negative impact on existing financial firms.
Although the panel was urging total deregulation in the financial industry, Ikeo said, if there was a need for rules in exceptional cases, they should be clearly written in financial laws so bureaucrats would not need to intervene.
In the past, deregulation plans were drawn up by bureaucrats in powerful ministries such as finance, trade and construction, which have carefully guarded industries they surpervise. But these have been slow in getting results, and criticism from the United States and other major trading partners has continued.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government has wanted to step up efforts to cut bureaucratic red tape to boost the fragile economy, because its high-cost structure is making the country less attractive to investors.
The panel, set up in July by the Economic Planning Agency, comprises six subcommittees focusing on finance, information technology, distribution, land, employment and medicine.
The subcommittees on land, distribution and medicine presented proposals last week and the two on employment and medicine unveiled recommendations separately on Thursday, all of which called for sweeping reform in each field.
The proposals will become an outline for the advisory council's final recommendation to the prime minister, which will be made in December after the council hears the opinions of bureaucrats on each issue.
Panel chairman Koichi Minaguchi told a news conference that he wanted to ensure that the panel's efforts would not be a ""total waste of energy"".
""The ministries concerned all agree that they are heading in the direction outlined in the reports, but when it comes to specifics, they said they still have different opinions,"" Minaguchi said.
EPA officials were also cautious about the future of the proposals by the panel, however, as any action taken may hinge on the outcome of general elections set for October 20.
""It is not clear how ministers in the new government to be formed will treat those proposals,"" an EPA official said.
Haruo Shimada, also a key member of the panel, said, however, that any delay in overhauling laws relating to employment would be ""suicidal"".",0
"Seven of Japan's eight biggest life insurers said on Wednesday that they experienced a drop in assets in the first half of the current fiscal year, the first such fall in many years.
Executives attributed the decline to a cancellation of pension fund management contracts after the firms cut their guaranteed rate of return in April.
""It was the first time we have seen a drop in assets since we started announcing our interim business reports (six years ago),"" said Taichi Ohtaki, managing director of Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. ""It would probably be the first time we have experienced a decline in our assets since World War Two.""
Combined assets at the eight firms totalled 142.8 trillion yen ($1.26 trillion) at the end of September, down 1.2 percent from 144.6 trillion yen ($1.27 trillion) at the end of March.
Only Nippon Life Insurance Co, the biggest life insurer in Japan, increased its assets -- to 39.44 trillion yen ($349 billion) from 39.03 trillion yen ($345 billion).
The other firms are Meiji Life Insurance, Sumitomo Life Insurance, Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance, Mitsui Mutual Life Insurance, Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance and Chiyoda Mutual Life Insurance.
Assets of the eight account for about 75 percent of the total assets held by all Japanese life insurers.
The executives said that some corporate pension funds and the Pension Welfare Service Public Corp (PWSPC) -- an affiliate of the Welfare Ministry -- had cancelled fund management contracts in the first half of 1996/97, due to a cutback in the guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers to 2.5 percent from 4.5 percent.
The PWSPC said earlier this year that it had cancelled about five trillion yen ($44.2 billion) worth of fund management contracts with 18 life insurers.
However, some insurers were optimistic and said the decline in assets was only a temporary phenomenon.
""I think the cancellation of pension funds peaked out in the first half and assets at the end of next March will likely recover to the same level as at the end of last fiscal year,"" said Minoru Mochida, senior managing director at Meiji Life.
Analysts said that despite the decline in assets, the profitability of the insurers was improving.
A serious headache for the insurers has been the negative spread between current low investment yields and already promised payouts, they said. Since the cancellation of pension fund management contracts, the gap has been narrowing.
The payouts are calculated based on prospective investment yields at the time insurance policies were written.
Meiji Life's Mochida said the overall average guaranteed rate of return offered by life insurers would fall to about four percent in 1996/97 from about five percent in 1995/96, while investment yields would remain low at around three percent.
The eight firms also announced a combined 2.15 trillion yen ($19.0 billion) of problem loans as of the end of September, the first time they had revealed such statistics.
They said that at the end of September the amount of this total classified as ""bad loans"" -- loans to bankrupt companies and those on which interest payments are in arrears of six months or more -- was 1.06 trillion yen ($9.3 billion).",0
"First-half results from Japan's 20 biggest banks show they have moved back into the black despite hefty write-offs of problem loans.
Analysts said figures released by 10 trust and credit banks on Monday showed that all of Japan's big banks had continued actively writing off problem loans resulting from the collapse of Japan's 1980s asset ""bubble"".
The 10 biggest commercial banks announced their interim earnings and loan write-off statistics on Friday.
Combined write-offs by the 20 biggest banks totalled about 2.4 trillion yen ($21.4 billion) in the first half of the current financial year to September 30.
At the end of March, the Finance Ministry said the 20 banks had about 25 trillion yen ($223 billion) worth of problem loans, which include loans made to bankrupt companies and those on which interest payments are in arrears by six months or more.
Last fiscal year, the 20 big banks disposed of nearly 11 trillion yen ($98.2 billion) worth of problem loans.
Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said the 20 banks may dispose of at least five trillion yen ($44.6 billion) worth of problem loans in the current fiscal year in order to cut the size of problem loans to manageable levels.
Analysts said many big banks were now recovering from the difficulties caused by the problem loans, but some financially-weak banks would continue to struggle to dispose of such loans in the coming years.
Yoshinobu Yamada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan, said that major banks should be able to cut their problem loans to manageable levels this financial year, but added that ""some banks are still reeling from the bad loan problem.""
Three long-term credit banks -- Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank -- all recorded parent current profits for the first half after posting parent current losses in 1995/96.
Current profit is pre-tax and includes gains or losses from sales of securities.
The three said they disposed of 255.1 billion yen ($2.27 billion) of problem loans in the first half against a total of 1.93 trillion yen ($17.2 billion) last year.
The smallest long-term credit bank, Nippon Credit, said that it hoped to cut its problem loans to manageable levels by the end of 1997/98 at the earliest.
As of the end of September, problem loans at Nippon Credit stood at about 1.4 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) or nearly 14 percent of its total loans.
Japan's seven major trust banks, all of which posted parent current losses in 1996/97, said they posted combined parent current profits of 316.76 billion yen ($2.82 billion) in the first half after disposing of 1.02 trillion yen ($9.1 billion) of problem loans in the period. This compared with disposals of 2.69 trillion yen ($24.0 billion) last year.
A trust bank executive said the banks' combined parent current profit for the first half was a record as Japanese authorities had eased special reserve requirements for trust banks in March to free up funds to dispose of problem loans.
Analysts said the seven banks would use about one trillion yen ($8.9 billion) of the special reserves to write off problem loans in fiscal 1996/97.
Atsushi Takahashi, the managing director of Sumitomo Trust, told reporters that the bank aims to reduce its problem loans to manageable levels in the current financial year.",0
"A bill to lift a 50-year-old ban on holding companies is expected to be submitted to Japan's next parliament, with passage almost assured because of the government's ""Big Bang"" deregulation plans, economists say.
They added the financial industry would likely be the one which benefits first as the lifting of the ban would help it restructure and bail out troubled financial institutions.
Political haggling has delayed a decision on the holding companies ban for almost a year.
But the economists said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's plans to liberalise the financial markets by 2001 and the proposed breakup of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) mean the ban will likely be lifted.
A holding company is a firm which controls one or more companies, often by having a majority of shares in them, but does not engage in a specific business.
Big business has demanded for years that the ban be lifted, and the pressure on the government has increased recently as many companies push for deregulation to help them streamline and compete with overseas rivals.
The plan to break up NTT calls for it to be restructured into three firms under a holding company. The firm had resisted the break-up plans until the holding company option was offered.
U.S. occupation forces introduced the ban on holding companies in 1947 to break up powerful conglomerates, known as ""zaibatsu"", which the United States said had contributed to Japan's war effort.
""I am sure the ban will be relaxed broadly in line with ideas the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has been advocating,"" said Hideo Fujiwara, senior research fellow at LTCB Research Institute Inc.
The Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the anti-monopoly watchdog, said last week it plans to submit a bill to end the ban to the session of parliament which starts in January.
Last January, the FTC sought to revise the Anti-Monopoly Law to broadly remove the ban, which had the backing of the pro-business LDP.
But that failed when the Social Democratic Party, a member in the then-ruling coalition, called for only a partial lifting of the ban.
If the bill passes next year, the ban would be relaxed by October 1997 at the earliest.
""Even if the ban is lifted, not many companies will make use of the new corporate structure immediately,"" Fujiwara said.
Companies such as Sony Corp, Canon Inc and Asahi Glass Co Ltd may be able to establish holding companies as they have already split their operations, he said, but many other companies have not.
But financial companies are in a better position to take advantage of the change, some economists said.
""Holding companies will enable banks, brokers and insurers to break down barriers between them,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, a first vice president at Smith Barney International Inc.
Ikuyo said a holding company would make it easy for a big financial institution to streamline its corporate group, in particular, bailing out an ailing financial firm in the group.
The economists also said regional banks which tie up under a holding company would be able to boost their coverage areas.
Some warn, however, that financial holding companies would not solve all the problems facing the financial industry, in which too many deposit-taking institutions are competing.
""Like the recently collapsed Hanwa Bank, not all failed financial institutions can be bailed out through a holding company,"" LTCB Research's Fujiwara said.
The Finance Ministry last month suspended most operations at Hanwa and will eventually wind down the regional bank, which collapsed under the weight of its problem loans.",0
"Japan's third biggest securities house, Nikko Securities Co, will focus on cutting personnel and other costs as it braces for ""Big Bang"" financial reforms, executive vice president Masao Yuki said on Friday.
""The Big Bang reforms will mean the survival of the fittest,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""The (Japanese) financial sector must correct its high-cost structure to cope with the Big Bang. If it doesn't, we will lose out to our Western rivals,"" he said.
The most important and urgent issue for Nikko is how to cut personnel costs while raising the salaries of talented young workers and maintaining overall morale, he said.
He acknowledged this would be a very difficult task and he had no specific ideas at this time, but Japan's manufacturers had already made impressive progress in this area.
""(Japanese) manufacturers say that brokerages and financial institutions have been living the good life. That's why they say it will be difficult for us to restructure,"" he said.
Tinkering with personnel practices is widely considered taboo at large Japanese companies.
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto unveiled plans in November for a five-year ""Big Bang"" set of policy moves to liberalise Japan's financial markets and catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.
Market sources said that since late last year the Tokyo stock market has focused on the negative impact of the Big Bang reform on Japanese financial institutions, as they would heat up the competition and create losers as well as winners in the financial markets.
On Friday, the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares ended down 220.10 points, or 1.23 percent, at 17,689.36. The index has shed nearly 2,000 points since the beginning of this year, led by the banking and brokerage sector.
Yuki said that, while Tokyo's Big Bang would eventually provide business opportunities for brokers and help revitalize Japan's financial markets, it would also pressure brokers' earnings in the near term.
""It is inevitable that we'll face a tough fight for profits in the near term,"" he said. ""Such a severe business environment may result in an industry-wide shakeout including mergers and acquisitions.""
Last week, Moody's Investors Service issued a grim rating outlook for Japanese brokerages, noting that the securities industry was faced with the dual challenges of operating in volatile markets and strategically repositioning itself in a deregulated landscape.
The likely elimination of fixed commission rates on stockbroking was cited as one move likely to undermine profitability at many brokerages, it said.
Yuki said that there would be no quick remedies to boost currently sagging bank and brokerage stocks, but policies were need to ensure Japan's economic recovery and implement drastic reforms of the nation's economic structure.
He added that the abolition of Japan's securities transaction tax, as urged by some politicians and business leaders, would also help Japan's stock market.
Japan is the only country with a securities transaction tax.
""I don't advocate any government moves to artificially prop up stock prices ... but announcing the abolition (of the tax by the end of March) would have a good effect on stocks,"" he said.
He said that, since Japan has already announced a sweeping deregulation of foreign exchange transactions beginning in 1998, failure to abolish the transaction tax would encourage institutional investors to go abroad to trade Japanese stocks due to higher costs here.",0
"Japan's financial industry suffered another blow on Tuesday when a court was asked to start bankruptcy proceedings against a major realtor which has estimated liabilities of almost $5.5 billion.
But analysts said that while the collapse of Osaka-based Sueno Kosan could affect some individual financial institutions, it was unlikely to have any major negative impact on the overall financial industry.
The Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC), a semi-governmental body set up to collect problem loans run up by seven failed mortgage companies, said on Tuesday it had asked the Osaka District Court to start bankruptcy proceedings against Sueno Kosan and two of its affiliates.
If Sueno Kosan, an unlisted real estate company which borrowed heavily from the ""jusen"" mortgage firms, is declared bankrupt, it could become one of Japan's biggest ever business failures, analysts said.
The HLAC said it has claims totalling 347 billion yen ($3.07 billion) on Sueno Kosan and the two units. The claims were transferred from the failed jusen firms to the body.
In total, Sueno Kosan group's liabilities are estimated at 620 billion yen ($5.48 billion), said Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co, a private credit research body.
Japan's banking industry was also jolted last month when a major financing company, Nichiei Finance Co Ltd, filed for liquidation with huge debt liabilities. Like the jusen and Sueno Kosan, Nichiei was a casualty of the property-related lending boom in the late 1980s ""bubble era"" and the subsequent dive in asset prices.
The Osaka court has taken steps to seize the assets of Sueno Kosan and its affiliates in response to the application, the HLAC statement said. There was no immediate comment from Sueno Kosan on the moves.
Although the overall damage to the financial system may be slight, analysts said individual non-bank financial institutions with outstanding loans to Sueno could suffer. A non-bank financial institution makes loans but does not take deposits, raising funds by borrowing from banks.
""Should Sueno be forced into bankruptcy and its assets distributed, many of the other lender non-banks will be forced to absorb huge losses relative to their size,"" said James Fiorillo, ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst.
""This will probably force many of them (creditors) into distress or bankruptcy, so the outcome...should be closely watched,"" he said.
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo did not appear to be that worried, although he told reporters the Sueno Kosan problem might spread to financial firms that had lent it money.
""However, such an impact will be resolved among related financial institutions in accordance with our financial system,"" he said.
Noboru Matsuda, governor of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC), which supervises the HLAC, said in a statement that it was inevitable such action would be taken against some ""malignant"" borrowers like Sueno, which he said had repeatedly attempted to hide assets.
In June, Japan adopted a controversial plan that allowed for the use of 685 billion yen ($6.06 billion) in public funds to help wind up the jusen.",0
"One year after the peak of Japan's banking crisis, financial institutions are still reeling from the shock, and some have not escaped bankruptcy, analysts say.
Bankers say the worst of the bad loan nightmare is over, but analysts believe Japan's financial industry remains vulnerable.
""It will take some time for confidence in Japanese banks to be restored -- at least until real estate transactions are reactivated,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International.
Bad loans largely take the form of land collateral.
""Even for big banks, it will take a few years to write off most problem loans and this will hurt their earnings,"" he said.
Financial analyst Hideichiro Nishimura at Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics said that despite vigorous efforts by the government and banks to clear the bad loan mess in the past year, confidence in Japanese financial institutions has not improved in international markets.
Currently stable share prices and low interest rates are helping banks dispose of problem loans steadily and on schedule, but their efforts to restructure operations still fall short of boosting their declining asset quality, he said.
August 30 last year saw Japan's first bank failure since World War Two. The financial system was jolted as major regional bank Hyogo Bank and the country's biggest credit union, Kizu Shinyo Kumiai, collapsed due to adventurous lending during the ""bubble economy"" of the late 1980s.
Ahead of that dark day, the biggest credit union in Tokyo, Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai, had collapsed, and then this year, second-tier regional bank Taiheiyo Bank went under.
Several analysts expect more bank failures.
""Everyone knows what has to happen (more financial failures), but no one knows when and how and who pays,"" an analyst at a foreign securities firm said.
To dispose of 10.7 trillion yen ($99.0 billion) of loan losses, many of Japan's biggest banks posted net losses in the fiscal 1995/96, ended March 31.
But counting all deposit-taking institutions, on that date there were still 8.3 trillion yen ($76.8 billion) of loan losses which need to be written off, the Finance Ministry said.
In June, parliament passed bills to clean up the nation's bad loan mess and deal with bank failures, along with a scheme to wind up failed mortgage firms, using taxpayers' money.
Analysts are cool about such efforts, however.
A spokeswoman at international credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service said it has not much changed its BFSR (bank financial strength rating) since August last year, when it unveiled the BFSR for major Japanese banks for the first time.
Moody's last week warned that some of Japan's seven major trust banks may need external support in order to survive growing competition and the burden of bad debts.
Moody's gave Chuo Trust & Banking and Yasuda Trust & Banking an ""E"" ranking, meaning that they suffer from very weak intrinsic financial strength, and gave only a slightly better ""E+"" rating to Mitsui Trust & Banking and Nippon Trust Bank.
It also kept Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Nippon Credit Bank at the ""E"" it gave them last August.
""We expect banks with very weak financial fundamentals to ultimately require assistance either from the authorities or from their respective corporate group members,"" Moody's said.",0
"Japan's depressed real estate market is unlikely to get much immediate help for its problems despite market euphoria over possible state purchases of land once owned by troubled financial firms, analysts said.
Tokyo's key stock index surged on Thursday, led by property-related issues, after a newspaper report saying the government was considering using public funds to buy collateralised land formerly owned by failed mortgage firms and other troubled financial firms.
The index, the Nikkei 225, ended up 2.43 percent at 19,051.71, its first close above 19,000 points for more than a month.
A Finance Ministry official told Reuters a government panel was considering using funds already set aside in the next state budget to buy land formerly owned by troubled financial firms.
Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa later confirmed the possibility, telling a news conference it was possible public-sector firms may purchase such land.
He said the plan would help ease the liquidity crisis affecting real estate.
A government panel, whose members include officials from the ministries of finance, construction and justice and the National Land Agency, was set up last October to tackle the tough issue of collecting problem loans for which land is being held as collateral.
At present, firms cannot afford to sell at market levels since they would realise their huge losses caused by the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy early this decade.
This has led to stagnation in the real estate market and kept the massive problem hanging over the whole financial sector.
""The panel has been discussing how to increase liquidity in the real estate market to facilitate collection of such problem loans,"" said an official at a bank involved in the discussions.
""But we have not talked about any details yet.""
However, he said that if the government decided to buy such collateralised land, it would have a positive impact since the private sector remained reluctant to buy land.
Jesper Koll, an economist at JP Morgan Securities Asia, said public land buying was not a new initiative and no new funds were likely to be allocated for the purchases.
However, he said that more important than any public purchases was Hashimoto's promise to speed up the process of turning real estate into equity assets.
""The faster banks and real estate companies are allowed to securitise property assets, the greater their prospects for increased income generation,"" he said. ""Prime Minister Hashimoto is getting serious about fixing Japan's real estate problem sooner, not later.""
Yoshinobu Yamada, a financial analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc, said that while the move by the government panel on land was not a new initiative, it would have a positive impact in the long-term.
""The government is well aware that it must take steps to stop falling land prices,"" he said, adding that a lack of land liquidity was at the core of Japan's bad-loan mess.
""If the government buys collateralised land formerly owned by jusen, this is likely to give psychological support to the the real estate markets and help the markets bottom out.""
However, he said no concrete policy steps would be available until March so that the current euphoria on the Tokyo's stock market could be only a passing fancy.",0
"Japan's Finance Ministry, which has long resisted calls from employers to reform the country's rigid corporate pension system, has finally decided to relax its tight grip.
However, industry sources say its proposals fall short of what is needed to cope with Japan's rapidly ""greying"" society and the poor financial state of employee pension funds resulting from record-low interest rates and a weak economic recovery.
""Unless Japan undertakes a drastic overhaul of the corporate pension system, it will remain out of step with the rest of the world,"" said an official at an overseas-based investment advisory company.
In the past, the amount of money Japanese corporate pension funds held was so small that authorities could regulate them without too much difficulty. But the amount has grown to about 60 trillion yen ($540 billion) and unless the current system is changed, it will hurt corporate balance sheets, he said.
Yoshihiko Miyauchi, a key member of an advisory panel to the prime minister, said on Thursday that the Finance Ministry had stated in a subcommittee meeting on deregulation that it would abolish restrictions on where employee pension funds managed by trust banks could be invested.
Under the current rules, each trust bank must invest at least half of the funds it manages in fixed-income assets, no more than 30 percent in Japanese stocks, no more than 30 percent in foreign currency-denominated shares and bonds, and no more than 20 percent in real estate.
Japan's corporate pension system is divided into employee pension funds, which are supervised by the Welfare Ministry, and Tax-Qualified Retirement Pension plans (TQPs), which are supervised by the Finance Ministry.
Miyauchi said the Finance Ministry was still considering whether to allow investment advisory firms to manage TQPs. It also told the subcommittee that it was studying whether to allow variable yields and flexible benefits, he said.
The Welfare Ministry has steadily lifted its restrictions on the management on employee pension funds, which have assets estimated at 42 trillion yen ($378 billion), and allowed investment advisory firms to manage the funds.
However, the Finance Ministry has barred investment advisory firms from managing TQPs, which have assets totalling 18 trillion yen ($162 billion). Only trust banks and life insurers are allowed to manage TQPs.
Employers participating in the corporate pension system are required to maintain specified yields, currently 5.5 percent a year, to guarantee predetermined benefits. But the actual return on investments is now only about three percent.
Because of the poor investment environment, many corporate pension funds are facing a shortage of funds to pay benefits to pensioners in the future, industry sources said. If pension funds fall short of meeting future payments, sponsoring companies must cover the shortfall.
Industry sources said that investment advisory firms, especially foreign companies, are keen to manage TQPs.
""Generally speaking, fund managers at Japanese companies are conservative,"" said the official with the investment advisory company.
""They tend to avoid investment risks because they see the risks, which are short-term volatility, as something dangerous. But experienced foreign advisors are well-qualified to manage pension funds as they take reasonable risks in long-term pension fund management over 20- to 30-year periods,"" he said.
He said British pension funds invest about 90 percent of their assets in equities, including about 15 percent in foreign stocks.
Ken Okamura, a strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson (Asia) Ltd, said in a recent report that if Japan completely abolished restrictions on asset management of corporate pension funds, it was likely to see more investment in local stocks.
He estimated that at the moment, life insurers and trust banks put an average of about 20 percent of the pension assets they are entrusted with into local stocks.",0
"Major Japanese non-life insurance company Yasuda Fire & Marine Co Ltd announced on Monday that it plans to take a majority stake in the Japanese unit of U.S. life insurance giant CIGNA Corp.
Terms of the deal, which would be the first time a Japanese non-life insurance company has purchased a life insurance subsidiary, were not disclosed.
Yasuda said it would boost its business cooperation with CIGNA Corp of the United States by taking a majority stake in CIGNA's Japanese unit, INA Life Insurance Co.
""It is the first time a Japanese non-life insurance company has taken over a life insurance company. We have cooperated over the past 15 years and that experience made this possible,"" Yasuda president Koichi Ariyoshi told a news conference.
Ariyoshi said the relationship between CIGNA and Yasuda was an example of private-sector cooperation between Japanese and American companies even though Washington has protested Tokyo's newly revised insurance law, which it says violates a U.S.-Japan trade agreement.
The companies began cooperating in 1981 and Yasuda acquired 10 percent of INA in July 1993, and now plans to boost that stake to more than 50 percent within the next year or two, Ariyoshi said.
Under Japan's new Insurance Business Law, which took effect on April 1, non-life insurers and life insurers are allowed to enter each other's business sectors through subsidiaries.
Japan and the United States have been at odds over the entry of Japanese insurance firms' subsidiaries into the so-called third-sector market, a lucrative niche market that covers accident insurance products, among others.
Japan's Finance Ministry is likely to put conditions on the entry of domestic insurance companies' subsidiaries into the third sector, industry sources said.
Ariyoshi did not disclose the cost of the planned purchase of INA shares. However, he added the cost was similar to what it had cost non-life insurance companies to establish life insurance subsidiaries.
Japan's 11 other non-life insurers set up life insurance subsidiaries earlier this month with share capital ranging from 10 billion yen to 30 billion yen ($92.5 million to $277 million).
The life insurance subsidiaries are expected to begin operations in October.",0
"Japanese banks, already groaning under problem loans, are dangerously exposed to the volatile Tokyo stock market and a further drop in the market may finally force them into a blood-letting reorganisation, analysts say.
They say that if the weaker banks are to survive, they must trim the size of their less-profitable assets, including those overseas, cut their stock portfolios and reduce the number of their employees.
""Weak banks may be thrown into the sector-wide reorganisation unless they take a serious look at reality -- that the market is urging an aggressive restructuring, even if they have to cut the number of employees,"" said Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice-president at Smith Barney International Inc.
""If share prices in (weak) banks fall to very cheap levels, it might be easier for big banks to bail out those weaker banks through cheap mergers,"" he said.
Market sources said the recent Japanese share price plunge has been led by active selling of shares in the banking sector, which represent one-quarter of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's market capitalisation.
On Monday, the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares closed down 609.70 points, or 3.37 percent, at 17,480.24.
Even though the market recovered slightly last week, the Nikkei is still down close to 2,000 points since the beginning of this year on worries about the economy and a lack of government measures to prop it up.
Japanese banks have traditionally held large chunks of shares in other companies, many of them customers. In the past, the unrealised profits on these holdings have helped burnish the banks' balance sheets and have provided a useful way of getting some of their problem loans off their books.
But the failure to tackle the problem more aggressively has in turn fueled scepticism about the soundness of the Japanese banking system, triggering more selloffs in the stock market, analysts said.
The analysts said banks should try to raise their profitability by focusing on specialised business fields, by developing new financial instruments and by lending to smaller firms with prospects for future growth.
Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst at Nikko Research Centre, said: ""To convince investors, banks must take the extra step to restructure, but they have made no such effort so far.""
In the three business years to the end of March 1996, Japan's then top 21 banks used 8.01 trillion yen ($68.4 billion) in net capital gains from the sale of equities to help dispose of 18.96 trillion yen ($162 billion) of property-related problem loans, a legacy from the late 1980s economic ""bubble"" era of inflated asset prices.
But the top banks still had 17.4 trillion yen ($148 billion) of problem loans at the end of last September, the Finance Ministry said.
Moody's Investors Service said on Friday that the sharp fall in Japanese shares will affect financially weak banks.",0
"The collapse of a major real estate company which borrowed heavily from Japan's ""jusen"" mortgage firms would be unlikely to have any major negative impact on the financial industry, analysts said on Tuesday.
Earlier on Tuesday, a semi-governmental body set up to collect problem loans run up by the ""jusen"" companies said it was seeking the involuntary bankruptcy of unlisted real estate firm Sueno Kosan.
The Housing Loan Administration Corp (HLAC) made the request to an Osaka court.  
""The action has been already factored in (to the financial markets),"" said Takakazu Nakamori, an official at credit research firm Teikoku Databank.
He said the Finance Ministry appeared to have recognised the problem and given the go-ahead for the forced bankruptcy.
Yushiro Ikuyo, first vice president at Smith Barney International, said the loan body was taking the right course of action, given the severity of the Sueno Kosan problem.  
Banks which had loans to the failed jusen firms and related companies like Sueno Kosan have mostly made loan loss provisions, as well as forgiving loans under the government's scheme to wind up the firms, he said. Those creditors will not have any problem from the expected insolvency, he said.
The HLAC said in a statement that it had also asked the Osaka District Court to start bankruptcy proceedings for two of Sueno Kosan's affiliates. The court has taken steps to seize their assets in response to the application, it also said.
The application also sought bankruptcy proceedings against three individuals associated with the firm, including president Kenichi Sueno, the HLAC said in its statement.  
The HLAC said it has claims totalling 347 billion yen on Sueno Kosan and two of its group firms. The claims were transferred from the failed jusen firms to the body, it said.
In June, Japan adopted a framework that allowed for the use of 685 billion yen of public money to help wind up the jusen.
The HLAC inherited assets totalling 6.5 trillion yen from the seven failed firms after 6.4 trillion yen worth of unrecoverable loans were written off with the help of financial institutions and public money.
Katsuhito Sasajima, a Nikko Research Centre analyst, said the action by the body was good news.  
""The insolvency of Sueno is not a matter of damage to the financial system... Rather, the market would probably appreciate the action as such legal procedures are transparent,"" Nikko's Sasajima said.
An HLAC official quoted a senior official of the Deposit Insurance Corp of Japan (DIC) as telling reporters in Osaka that the decision to seek the insolvency was taken after consultation with the Finance Ministry and that the move would not greatly affect the financial system as a whole.  
But although the overall damage to the financial system may be slight, analysts said individual non-bank financial institutions with outstanding loans to Sueno could suffer.
""Should Sueno be forced into bankrutpcy and its assets distributed, many of the other lender non-banks will be forced to absorb huge losses relative to their size,"" ING Baring Securities (Japan) analyst James Fiorillo said.
If Sueno Kosan is declared bankrupt, it would be one of the biggest Japanese insolvencies on record, analysts said.
""This will probably force many of them (creditors) into distress or bankruptcy, so the outcome...should be closely watched,"" Fiorillo said. In total, the Sueno Kosan group has liabilities of about 600 billion yen, he added.
Several analysts said that a non-bank institution, Apollo Leasing Co Ltd, may be affected. An official at Apollo said that the company has loans to Sueno Kosan and will try to figure out the impact of its collapse. He did not give further details. Non-bank financial institutions make loans but do not take deposits, borrowing money instead from banks.
There was no immediate comment from Sueno Kosan itself about the move by the loan-collecting body.  
A survey by the Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co, a private sector research arm, said Apollo Leasing had 21.13 billion yen in loans to Sueno as of the end of December 1995.
Other major creditors to Sueno at the end of last December included Inter-Lease Corp with claims of 5.35 billion yen, All Corp with 6.0 billion yen and Crown Leasing Corp with 17.6 billion yen, the research body said.
Analysts said the non-bank financial institutions had undertaken restructuring programmes by asking creditors to do such things as cut interest payments on loans and delay principal payments.",0
"France announced plans to create a major new force in the world defence industry on Wednesday, by selling state-owned defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe for a symbolic franc.
The government said it had preferred the bid by Lagardere, which owns defence company Matra, to the rival offer of largely civilian industrial group Alcatel Alsthom SA.
""The choice I made yesterday and which has been made public today is entirely based on a defence industrial logic,"" Prime Minisiter Alain Juppe told parliament
""We have opted for the offer which was the best to further our defence interest and which would constitute a world leading industrial group with strong export capacities,"" he said.
""The offers were comparable on a financial level. They both needed a capital increase,"" Finance Minister Jean Arthuis told a news conference. The state will make an 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) cash injection to Thomson SA prior to the sale.
Challenged in parliament about the cash injection, Arthuis said that ""Both Alcatel and Lagardere valued Thomson SA at minus 11 billion francs""
Loss-making Thomson SA owns 58 percent of defence electronics company Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of consumer electronics maker Thomson Multimedia which specialises in digital television and decoders and has Saba and RCA as brands.
Lagardere said it is bidding 156 francs a share, or 7.8 billion francs in total, to buy the minorities in Thomson-CSF which it will then merge with Matra. Lagardere will keep 60 percent of Thomson Matra while the French state will have a golden share to safeguard national security interests.
Lagardere will sell Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea.
The government said Daewoo was a well known investor in France and had knowledge of mass production techniques. Daewoo has made commitments on jobs -- creating 3,000 new jobs in France -- technology and investments.
Thomson Multimedia management will remain French-based.
Arthuis said the European Commission would have to approve the cash injection and study competition issues. He said the sale would take place before the end of the year and the cash for the injection would come from other privatisations.
The independent privatisation commission, which has an important say in the sale of state assets, still has to give its advice on the sale. Arthuis said the government had not wanted to keep its choice secret, as would have been usual, until the privatisation commission's advice ""to avoid insider trading"".
The decision was a surprise as markets and the media had gambled Alcatel's no-nonsense chairman Serge Tchuruk would take the prize over self-made entrepreneur Jean-Luc Lagardere, 69, who is preparing to hand over power to his son, Arnaud.
Lagardere also owns publishers Hachette and Filipachi.
Thomson SA lost 1.379 billion francs in 1995 and has 25 billion francs of debt. Wholly-owned Thomson Multimedia lost three billion in the first half of 1996, but Thomson-CSF is profitable and had 1995 earnings of 1.01 billion francs.
The government said Lagardere wanted to leave the share capital of microelectronics maker SGS-Thomson Microelectronics NV by selling its 20 percent stake to the other main shareholders. France Telecom said it and CEA Industries were ready to buy that stake and keep French interests at the same level as the stake of Italian companies .
Alcatel's shares rose sharply on Thursday morning on market relief. Analysts doubted its capacity to finance the Thomson deal. Lagardere shares were suspended for the day.",0
"French carmakers Renault SA and Peugeot PSA said on Wednesday that they were in talks with the government on a long-term plan to rejuvenate their workforce.
But the companies did not confirm a newspaper report they were seeking approval for a five-year plan to cut 40,000 jobs in an early retirement scheme in exchange for hiring 14,000 young people. Newspaper Les Echos said the cost of these operations could be 30 billion francs ($6 billion).
""Our chairman Louis Schweitzer and Peugeot chairman Jacques Calvet have written a letter to Prime Minister Alain Juppe in July with a proposal,"" a Renault spokeswoman said.
""There have been discussions since but the government has not yet replied,"" she added.
At Peugeot, officials declined to comment on the existence of the letter but a spokesman said that the French car industry needed to rejuvenate its work force.
""In France, the average age of a car worker is 42 to 43 years but our competitors, especially Asian, have an average age of below 30 years,"" the Peugeot spokesman said.
He said that this gave Peugeot and Renault a competitive handicap at a time when the markets are increasingly being opened up -- from 1999 a quota system limiting Japanese car imports in Europe will be lifted.
Younger workers are not only cheaper but also more flexible and open to new techniques such as ""empowerment"" - a management idea giving workers more responsibility for their own work, the Peugeot official said.
At Renault the average age is 45 years. ""We have old factories, the oldest is at Flins which dates from the war, and therefore the average age is rather high,"" the Renault spokeswoman said.
Renault had a worldwide staff of 139,950 people at the end of 1995. Of them, 72,163 were involved in car production in France.
At PSA Peugeot Citroen, the group number is 139,900 of whom 122,600 are in car production in France.
French car makers are experiencing difficulties and a two-year government old-for-new car incentive scheme has not helped to overcome market problems.",0
"Storage Technology Corp on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with the Swedish patent office for the sale of a disc-based storage system and was in talks with the Chinese patent office about a similar deal.
The two events follow an earlier system sale to the European Patent Office, based in The Hague.
""It's too early to talk about the details of the Chinese deal, we are still in discussions. It can still take some time before we have a contract,"" Campbell McGarvie, vice-president Europe, Africa and Midle East, said in an interview.
He gave no financial details of the Swedish deal.
StorageTek, based in Louisville, Colorado, specialises in the storage and retrieval of digital information and increasingly is moving away from digital documents to bit-map images. Bit-map images are digital pictures. Bit-map images open up the possibility of storing medical scans or video images. Potential users of StorageTek's new products are members of the medical profession or broadcasters.
StorageTek has disc-based products as well as tape-based products. In tape, it makes products for such companies as Siemens and Cie des Machines Bull.
On August 19, the company signed a deal with AT&T Corp's NCR unit under which NCR will market its Timberwolf tape system, a system for storing information.
But the NCR deal is less far reaching than a June 10 deal with International Business Machines Corp under which StorageTek will make IBM branded products.
The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the deal and in particular is looking at the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the direct-access storage devices industry. Pending completion of the probe, the deal cannot be finalised. Earlier this month, both StorageTek and IBM have said the inquiry was routine and expected.
Financial analysts say that, should the deal go through, it could add hundreds of millions of dollars to StorageTek's revenues.
""That was a major deal, it was big change for IBM. Never before had IBM allowed another company to build such major components as storage facilities,"" McGarvie said.
According to the IDC research buro, StorageTek had an 11 percent share of the disc-based storage market in the first quarter of 1996 while IBM had a 30 percent stake.
Should the deal go through, the two companies would hold just under half of the market, estimated for 1997 at 3,500 terrabytes (one thousand mega bytes), valued at $3.5 billion. The combined market share could grow to more than 50 percent in the next few years.
EMC Corp is currently market leader with 43 percent, and Japan's Hitachi Ltd Hitachi Data has a share of over 11 percent.
""The deal is mutually exclusive. IBM will also fund our research and while we begin with the Iceberg product it will also involve new products,"" McGarvie said. The Iceberg, a StorageTek product, is a storage system for discs.
StorageTek's Toulouse facility in France, opened in June 1995, will make IBM-branded products and the deal is expected to speed up the unit's expansion.
At Toulouse, some 100 people work on manufacturing and research and development. Storagetek is committed to increase this to 470 people within four years and McGarvie said that this would now easily be met, probably sooner than in four years.
In the medical imaging and video market, StorageTek sees a lot of opportunities but for the moment it has not yet signed big deals. ""We are in discussions for some deals which could be concluded next year,"" French marketing manager Eric Debray said.
On a horizon of five to 10 years, McGarvie believes the company could reap benefits from the Internet and Intranet online network services, coupling its storage facilities to online retrieval systems.
StorageTek acquired the company Network Systems about a year ago. This company offers network solutions as well as security products such as Borderguard, which is a ""firewall"" products.
A firewall shields sensitive internal computer information from the public internet and aims to prevent hackers from breaking into commercially vital information data bases.
""It's one of the main worries at the moment. Many companies want to go on the net but they fear that they will open up their internal systems to possible intrusion,"" McGarvie said.",0
"French computer maker Cie des Machines Bull now has the freedom to deal with any other computer group in Europe following the sale of some five percent of its shares held by the government.
Thierry Breton, managing director of Bull, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company still planned to be part of a restructuring of the European computer industry.
""With the support of our private shareholders, we can do that either by a market operation, by a merger or acquisition or by both,"" he said.  
""Rather than to wait for when the opportunity presented itself before doing anything, the shareholders decided to put us in a position so that we can act as a private company when the time is ripe.""
Breton said others involved in the restructuring of the European computer industry included Italy's Olivetti, Philips Electronics of the Netherlands and Siemens AG of Germany.
""There are also the European units of U.S. companies that may be interested in participating in the restructuring,"" he added.  
Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the former McKinsey consultant who became chairman in 1993, earlier this year said Bull wanted the state to sell 20 percent to a fourth industrial partner, preferably European, and to financial investors.
Bull returned to profit in 1995 after posting combined losses of 22 billion francs since 1990.
The French government has said it plans to privatise Bull before the end of 1997.
Breton said the state share sale would take place after a capital increase amounting to ""several hundreds of millions of francs.""  
The state will subscribe to its portion of the capital increase, but resell its shares to private investors.
Motorola of the U.S., NEC of Japan and France Telecom, which each have a 17 percent stake, are expected to subscribe to their part.
""They are on our strategic commission. They come here every three months for two days. I think I can say that we have the support of our shareholders,"" Breton said.
IBM, which has 1.6 percent, is not expected to join in the capital increase. It has passed up two previous opportunities.  
Japan's Dai Nippon Printing, with 3.3 percent, has been invited to join the capital increase.
Bull in February effectively withdrew from the personal computer market by merging its Zenith Data division with Packard Bell Electronics Inc.
Breton said the company was standing by its profit forecast of higher profits in 1996 compared with a 306 million profit in 1995, but he declined to confirm the group was aiming for more than 600 million.
""We keep our forecast, we are on line to deliver on our promise,"" Breton said.",0
"The planned sale of state-owned Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics has whipped up a storm of protest which on Monday drove down shares in the Korean company's French partner Lagardere Groupe.
Lagardere shares were down more than five percent at midday on investor worries about the backlash of the Thomson sale that risks clouding the outlook for future French privatisations.
French opposition parties, labour unions and most French people, according to polls, are unhappy with the government's plan to sell Thomson, the world's fourth biggest television set maker, to Lagardere and Daewoo for one franc.
Thomson Multimedia workers protested against the deal on Friday and plan a demonstration in November against what they have likened to an enforced ""fire sale"".
The mounting opposition, and the strongly nationalist tone, could augur badly for foreign buyer interest in future privatisations as the government prepares to sell insurer GAN, Credit Lyonnais and Air France.
The backlash also took the steam out of a rally in shares in Lagardere, which had risen as much as 32 percent after the government announced on October 16 that it had selected it over rival Alcatel Alsthom to buy Thomson Multimedia (TMM)- also a leader in the new digital technology.
""Lagardere is down because of the recent news articles that put in doubt the Thomson deal,"" a dealer said.
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Monday the procedure followed by the government was ""sheltered from all politicial criticism"".
Thomson owns 58 percent of defence firm Thomson-CSF and 100 percent of TMM.
The government tilted toward Lagardere's bid because of the defense connection. Lagardere plans to merge its Matra unit with Thomson-CSF and sell TMM to Daewoo -- also for one franc.
""The public authorities focused on the military aspect of the Thomson deal. They neglected the civilian (consumer electronics) aspect...it's now sticking in their throats,"" said the newsletter La Lettre de l'Expansion.
A survey of 1,004 voters published by the newspaper La Tribune found 72 percent disapproved of the sale price, saying it did not reflect TMM's value. Only 12 percent agreed with the government that the price was right given the group's debts.
TMM is saddled with the bulk of Thomson's debt, expected to reach 28 billion francs ($5.44 billion) by the end of the year.
Loser Alcatel broke its silence on Friday and said it would not have sold control of TMM to a foreign group but put together a 50-50 joint venture with an Asian partner.
""This new group would have formed the basis of a global industrial project in which French interests would have been solidly represented,"" Alcatel said in a statement.
The newspaper Les Echos said in an unsourced report on Monday that Alcatel had also pledged to transfer to the state any capital gain on the sale of part of TMM.
The deal hinges on the approvals of France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission, and speculation is rising that the privatisation commission -- which had been expect to make only a procedural review -- may turn into a more serious stumbling block.
The commission, a body of seven independent experts chaired by Pierre Laurent, has the mandate to ensure that any deal reflects the value of the company.
""Of course they can disagree with the government,"" a Finance Ministry official said. ""If they agree, the deal can go ahead. If they disagree, the privatisation procedure has to be started over again,"" he added.",0
"South Korea's Daewoo Electronics staged a charm campaign on Wednesday with newspaper advertisements after fierce criticism about its plans to buy France's state-owned loss-making Thomson Multimedia.
Under a banner ""Do you know the dwarf Daewoo?"", the 34th biggest world company"" the group tried to counter growing resentment in France that a ""tiny"" South Korean company was set to buy a ""leading"" French group for one symbolic franc.
France's Privatisation Commission will state in early December whether it agrees with a government plan to sell defence and consumer electronics Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe for one franc after an 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) capital injection.
Lagardere will sell Thomson Multimedia, a maker of televisions and video recorders and a leader in digital video technology, to Daewoo.
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, giving in a little to opposition from the Socialist Party and some members of his majority, last week said there would be a parliamentary debate before the final government decision on the deal. But the debate will not be followed by a parliament vote on the proposal.
In full-page advertisements in most French newspapers on Wednesday, Daewoo said that its electronics arm had about the same sales figure as Thomson Multimedia, at some 40 billion francs, although with a profit which the French company lacks.
It said that its global sales network, especially in Asia, would allow better market access for Thomson's new products such as flat screen television sets and televisions that can be connected to the Internet computer network.
The company also said that ""Daewoo believes in France"" and said it had made investments in the country and had close ties with a number of French companies.
""Contrary to all other competitors who have based themselves in or moved to neighbouring countries, Daewoo has chosen France. Simply because it believes in France"".
Parliamentarians of the Communist Party are organising a seminar on the privatisation of Thomson on November 13. They want the promised parliament debate to be televised and joined a call by the Socialist Party for an inquiry commission to study the way the government came to its decision.
The European Commission, meanwhile, is studying the Lagardere bid as well as a rival offer by Alcatel Alsthom and could make its findings on competition issues and the state cash injection known by December 4.
Lagardere finance dirtector Philippe Camus said on Wednesday that a change in the government's decision would be a ""total catastrophe in the international financial community"".
Speaking to a seminar organised by brokers Ferri, Camus said he did not understand the hostility toward Daewoo.
""Daewoo has made commitments on jobs and people say to them, Out! France is going to have a big credibility problem,"" he said.",0
"French state-owned Air France said on Thursday it was ready to take on the tougher competition posed by the planned foray into the French domestic market of British flag-carrier British Airways Plc (BA).
BA's TAT French unit on Wednesday announced a joint 780 million franc bid ($151.2 million) with French private bank Rivaud for domestic carrier Air Liberte that will double its share of takeoff and landing slots at Paris' busy second airport Orly to 20 percent.
An Air France spokeswoman acknowledged BA's increased presence in France aviation would have an impact.
""It certainly has consequences for us. But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices,"" she said.
BA, one of the world's most profitable airlines, will in first instance manage its French assets from a distance. TAT and Air Liberte will operate separately at least until 1999 when the latter should have returned to profit.
The Creteil commercial court will meet on Friday to study the BA/Rivaud offer while an Air Liberte creditors meeting has the final say. Such a meeting is due within a month.
But the way to the finishing line is not without obstacles.
In Brussels, Richard Branson's Virgin Express said it planned to raise its bid for Air Liberte, in administration since September 26. The court-appointed administrator, Maitre Baronnie, reacted sceptically.
""I have never seen any bid by Virgin so I do not see how they can increase a bid,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
""Strictly theoretically, a new bid could be made just up to the moment that the creditors meet and accept the offer on the table. In the end the creditors decide,"" he added.
The pilot's union of Air France's domestic unit Air France Europe urged the government and chairman Christian Blanc to join the bidding battle for Air Liberte.
""It will allow our country to remain master of its skies. Otherwise, there will not be any French competition because there will be no French air transport industry left,"" the SNPL pilots union said in a statement.
Air France is constrained from expanding in France until 1997, under conditions imposed by the European Commission for state rescue capital injections.
Air Inter dominated French domestic routes and Orly airport until as recently 1995 when the French government decided to open some major domestic routes to competition ahead of full liberalisation from April 1997.
A spokesman for Air Inter, now renamed Air France Europe, said the company had at the moment a 60 percent share on the total French market.
Domestic airlines Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war. As a result they have suffered financially.
Industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside British Airways.",0
"Several thousand employees of French consumer electronics company Thomson Multimedia held protest marches in Paris and other towns on Wednesday against the planned sale of the group to South Korea's Daewoo.
Workers of the state-owned company came in busloads to Paris to demonstrate in front of the group's headquarters in the centre of the capital before heading to the parliament buildings. There were also protest marches in Rennes, Bordeaux, Nice and Grenoble.
Thomson staff are angry that they have not been involved in the decision and say they do not understand the economic logic behind it.
""The sale of Thomson Multimedia to the Korean group Daewoo is unacceptable,"" said a protesting Thomson worker in Rennes, the capital of the western Britanny region where police said 1,200 people marched.
""This company is running fine and makes top quality products, we do not want to make low quality products,"" he added.
In Grenoble in the east about a thousand people marched, some shouting ""Daewoo, mechant loup"" (Daewoo, big bad wolf).
Industry Minister Franck Borotra told parliament during question time that privatisation was the only way to secure the future of Thomson Multimedia.
""This company is in a situation of a serious financial disaster,"" he said about the loss-making and indebted French state-owned group.
Workers, however, maintain the company is fundamentally profitable.
""Thomson is sold for one franc and the buyers will hit a 20 billion franc jackpot,"" said a slogan carried in the Rennes march.
The French government said last month it planned the sell the Thomson SA group to Lagardere Groupe for one franc after an 11 billion franc ($2.17 billion) capital injection.
Lagardere will keep Thomson SA's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF and sell television set and video recorder maker Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics, also for one franc.
France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission still have to approve the deal.
""What we want is a halt to the privatisation procedure and the start of serious discussions about the future of the electronics industry in this country,"" a labour union spokesman told France 2 television.
The Communist-led CGT wants to see a public sale of the Thomson Multimedia company on the market, with Lagardere taking a big stake.
Soon-hoon Bae, chairman of Daewoo Electronics, told a French parliamentary commission on Tuesday that the South Korean group could float part of Thomson Multimedia on the share market when it had returned to profit.
He said Daewoo planned to invest 13 billion francs in Thomson Multimedia, of which five billion would be invested in the next five years in France.",0
"A decision on the fate of ailing airline Air Liberte is not due until the start of next week and no bidder has yet formally submitted an offer to acquire the company, the president of the Creteil commercial court said.
""At the moment, no bid has been submitted,"" Dominique Leveque told Reuters by telephone. He denied newspaper reports that there was a 1400 GMT deadline for the bids.
""Bids have to be in today. That can be this afternoon or this evening. We are not going to close the mailbox,"" Leveque said.
He said the court would on Tuesday afternoon at the earliest make a statement about the bid or bids. After that it would study the offers.
""According to the law we have six months to study the situation. But it is clear that the company's cash position cannot hold another six months,"" he said.
""We will do all we can but the court cannot decide in 48 hours,"" Leveque said, adding a decision was due at the start of next week at the earliest.
British Airways is preparing a bid for the regional airline, proposing to merge it with its French TAT unit.  
A spokesman for British Airways in London said the company feared the French government would like a French company to acquire Liberte to prevent BA or another foreign airline from obtaining the carrier and its valuable slots at Orly airport.
Air Liberte owns between 20 and 25 percent of the slots at Orly, Paris' second largest airport specialising in domestic routes, which represents 20,000 take-offs and landings per year.
Air Liberte lost 650 million francs in the first nine months of 1996 and has debts of 1.5 billion francs. The company was placed under bankruptcy protection on September 26 after merger talks with other French airline AOM failed.  
Jacques Maillot, head of French travel company Nouvelles Frontieres and charter airline Corsair, said he planned to bid for both Air Liberte and AOM.
AOM, formerly Air Outre-Mer, is being put on sale by the state agency Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which is divesting former Credit Lyonnais assets.
Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic, said last week he might also bid for Air Liberte if BA did so. But a Virgin executive told Le Monde on Monday that the company was not yet sure whether a bid for Air Liberte was the best way to develop its business in France.  
Air Liberte is owned 32.3 percent by Groupe Rivaud. Banque Indosuez has 13 percent, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) 12 percent, Euralair 10 percent, Club Mediterranee has 8.5 percent, Lyonnaise de Banque 6.2 percent and SAE five percent.
Chairman and founder Lotfi Belhassine has six percent and other interests have the remaining seven percent.
Air Liberte expanded its network rapidly in the past year, making full use of the opening up of the big national routes such as Paris-Marseilles, Paris-Toulouse, Paris-Nice and Paris-Bordeaux.
Air France unit Air Inter, renamed Air France Europe, previously had a monopoly over these routes.
Air Liberte, AOM, Eurolair, BA's TAT and others cut their prices in order to win market share on the routes prior to the complete opening up of the French -- and European -- air market in 1997.
But Air Liberte was unable to fill its planes and posted losses. The company also claimed it suffered from a forced regrouping of its activities to Orly Sud terminal, while Air France and Air France Europe remained based in Orly Ouest.",0
"Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed-line telephone network in a residential area in this southern city.
""Local telecommunications are for CEGETEL a major strategic axis,"" Philippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit CEGETEL, told a news conference.
He said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.
In mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.
SFR expects to have one million customers by March 1997, Glotin said, against some 725,000 at the moment.
The local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in annual sales by 2003.
Glotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.
CEGETEL, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using DECT technology.
The version of DECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, applied in Nice uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.
DECT is also available in totally wireless versions.
The Nice experiment is small, with Glotin expecting 1,000 to 3,000 subscribers by the end of 1997, but it is a precursor of CEGETEL's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in local loops with radio links in the coming years to hone its skills ahead of market liberalisation in 1998.
A DECT service in Paris is expected to be ready in 1998 as the biggest part of an initial series of 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.
In Nice, subscribers pay between 20 and 50 francs per month for a subscription, get a 10 percent discount on calls using the France Telecom network and pay about 0.22 francs per minute for local calls.
The CEGETEL shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs at the start of 1997 to fund investments. Glotin said that the final make-up of CEGETEL's sharecapital would be known by year-end but he said it would be very close to the October agreement with BT taking 25 percent, SBC 15 percent and Mannesmann 10 percent.
""Changes are within the five percent limit,"" he said.
Glotin said that the success of CEGETEL, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.
Telecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.
""The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,"" Glotin said.
Another future rival to France Telecom is building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET.",0
"French Telecommunications Minister Francois Fillon has granted a telecoms operating licence to state-owned railroads group Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) as a further step towards the sector's liberalisation.
In a decree published in the Official Journal on Monday, Fillon said he was granting a 15-year licence to SNCF's Telecom Developpement unit to offer telecommunications services in an alternative to the France Telecom network.
SNCF still has to detail what assets it is going to put in the Telecom Development unit and also needs to get vetting for its tariffs. The operating licence sets technical standards, privacy issues and interconnection obligations.
The SNCF licence is the second such licence for a so-called ""alternative infrastructure"" in France. The first, for Eurotunnel unit TransManche to offer telecom links between London and Paris, was granted late last month.
A spokesman for the ministry said that ""in the next few days"" licences would be granted to MFS Communication Co of the U.S. and Colt Telecom Group of Britain, owned by financial group Fidelity Investments.
MFS and Colt will specialise on business networks in highly-populated areas but the SNCF licence covers the railroads' existing network of 8,000 kilometres of optic fibre all over the country, as well as radio links, which will be expanded to some 12,000 kilometres in the next six years, SNCF sources said.
The licence also allows Telecom Developpement to use other means beyond its own network.
SNCF aims to decide before the end of the year which company will operate the network. It has at least three offers from interested companies.
One is from CEGETEL, the Generale des Eaux unit in which British Telecommunications Plc and Mannesmann of Germany have a stake and which aims to become France's second biggest operator. It already runs the SFR mobile network.
Another is Bouygues which teamed up with Italy's STET for the SNCF offer and is also talking with Germany's VEBA.
A third offer is by the Unisource consortium of Dutch KPN, Telia AB of Sweden, Swiss Telecom PTT and Spain's Telefonica.
AT&T of the U.S. is keeping silent about its intentions but the operator, aiming to play an important role in France, is rumoured to be playing several cards at the same time -- industry sources said it bid both with its usual European ally Unisource as well as on its own account and there are also rumours it is in talks with Bouygues.
Bouygues and AT&T had no comment on the rumours.
SNCF declined to name the bidders and said it had recently asked them for more details on their bids before taking a decision.
The SNCF network could be a vital part in any operator's plans, cutting the time to set up a network in time for the 1998 start of competition as well as reducing investment needs.
Telecom Developpement, like any future rival to France Telecom, will have to contribute to the costs of running the public service of telecommunications which will remain assured by the national operator.
A first tranche of 20 percent in France Telecom is expected to be floated on the share market this spring.",0
"France Telecom chairman Michel Bon said on Tuesday the French operator wanted to grow internationally in order to offset the impact of competition in France.
""We will not enjoy all the market growth in France,"" Bon told a news briefing.
From 1998, France Telecom will lose its monopoly position entirely and both Generale des Eaux and Bouygues have formed international alliances to take it on.
France Telecom officials said the group aimed to generate at least 10 percent of its sales abroad.
Bon, in Belgium for the inauguration of the country's second mobile telecommunications operator, Mobistar, said France Telecom's international policy was based on three main goals.
Firstly, the group wanted to answer the international needs of its clients. This is mainly done through the Global One joint venture with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp of the United States.
Secondly, the group wants to use its know-how in building modern infrastructure networks and is setting up such networks in Latin America and Indonesia.
Thirdly, the group is looking for ""new growth areas"" to compensate for the impact on sales of the new competition in France, Bon said.
Mobistar, in which France Telecom has a majority stake, is part of this policy. The Beglian operator started six weeks ago and has 20,000 subscribers, aiming for a 25 percent market share in 2005.
France Telecom hopes to hear in November that a consortium it leads has won a GSM licence in Romania and the group is in negotiations with the government of Poland.
In Poland, France Telecom is operator of an analogue network but was excluded from getting a GSM digital licence. After a state visit by French President Jacques Chirac, the situation has improved for France Telecom, but negotiations are still continuing.
In Italy, France Telecom has no ambitions in mobile telecommunications, because of the presence of state-owned TIM Omnitel, which is run by Olivetti.
France Telecom is talking with Olivetti about co-operating in Infostrada, a fixed-line venture which is bidding for the network of the Italian railways.",0
"French state-owned airline Air France said on Thursday it was ready to take on the toughening competition in its domestic market posed by British Airways Plc (BA).
BA's TAT French unit on Wednesday announced a joint 780 million franc bid ($151.2 million) with bank Rivaud for domestic carrier Air Liberte that will double its share of takeoff and landing slots at Paris' busy second airport Orly to 20 percent.
An Air France spokeswoman acknowledged BA's increased presence in France aviation would have an impact.
""It certainly has consequences for us. But we will continue with improving our product and service while cutting our costs and prices,"" she said.
After approval by the Creteil commercial court, scheduled to meet on Friday, and an Air Liberte creditors meeting due within a month, BA would take a 70 percent stake in loss-making Air Liberte.
A spokesman for Air France Europe, the domestic wing of the Air France operation, said the company had an 80 percent market stake on the routes it operates and 60 percent on the total French market.
But from April 1997, European liberalisation of the airline industry will fully throw open French airspace to competition.
The French government moved the door ajar at the start of 1996 by allowing competition on the busy Paris-Toulouse and Paris-Marseille routes which were controlled by state-owned Air Inter, part of the Air France group.
Other French airlines had been allowed to fly less busy domestic routes as well as European and international routes.
British Airways bought its first 49.9 percent stake in TAT in 1993 and obtained the remainder last July.
Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war against Air France Europe, the renamed Air Inter. As a result they have suffered financially.
AOM, headed by Alexandre de Couvelaire, had been in talks with Air Liberte with an eye to a merger but the worsening financial situation at Air Liberte, which sought creditor protection on September 26, made a deal impossible.
AOM, 99 percent owned by the Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which was set up to sell assets of bank Credit Lyonnais, is now going it alone with some 10 percent of the slot at Orly.
But industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside British Airways.
Air France Europe plans to launch its ""Shuttle"" service between Paris and Toulouse next Monday, offering more departure times and a ""turn up and go"" service without reservations, as a major plank in its new commercial approach.
Other airlines in France are Air Littoral, owned by the Dufour family, the Dubreuil family's Regional airlines, Xavier Leclerq's Brit Airlines as well as Nouvelles Frontieres' Corsair and Euralair.
For Air France, these domestic lines are important potential feeder operations for its international operations.
Last week Air france signed cooperation pacts with Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines Inc of the U.S. and it aims to sign a similar deal with an Asian airline in 1997.",0
"Shares in French sports equipment maker Groupe Salomon SA fell sharply for the second day in a row on Thursday after a long and steady rise which saw the share more than double in value this year.
Dealers said that the company, headed by Jean-Francois Gautier and based in the mountain region of Annecy in the east of France, had become the victim of a number of rumours which cast a pall over the dynamic picture of the company.
Salomon executives were in London on Thursday on the second day of an investors' road-show, discussing the recent first half sales figures.
""There are two rumours in the market. One is that a Japanese distributor has gone bankrupt, which could cost the company money, and the other is that the roadshow is going badly,"" a share dealer said.
Salomon was down 17 francs, or 3.83 percent, at 427 francs at 1141 GMT after having given in 26 francs on Wednesday.
""In fact one of our distributors in Japan, Olympic Sports Co has gone bankrupt. But that is already in the first half figures and it will not change anything on the group level,"" Salomon spokeswoman Linda Champtenois told Reuters.
Olympic Sports applied for court mediation with creditors on September 20 with debts of 34.83 billion yen and the Japan Securities Dealers Association (JSDA) cancelled the company's Over-the-Counter registration.
Salomon's Champtenois said that ""everybody knows about the difficult market for winter sport equipment in Japan"" and brushed off the effect on Salomon's results.
Meanwhile Salomon's Japanese subsidiary Salomon & Taylor Made Co was trading in Tokyo at 810 yen, just above its life low of 790 yen and far below its year high of 1,790 yen. It was introduced on the OTC market in November 1995 at 1,800 yen.
On November 5, the Japanese unit reduced its parent six-months net results forecast to 288 million yen from 620 million yen and a comparable figure of 556 million.
Champtenois said that the roadshow in London had been long planned, followed on a September 30 visit to Edinburgh and was ""going fine"".
French dealers said that even if the rumours were unfounded and the Japan effect limited, they were a catalyst for profit-taking, especially now that the French market has hit a year high at a level not seen since in 1994.
Salomon has been a stock market darling. From a low of 171.50 francs on March 14 in 1995, Salomon rose to an all-time high of 494 francs on October 22 this year.
On October 30, it said its first half sales to end September, at constant currency rates, rose by 21.8 percent to 2.021 billion francs.
While hiking equipment -- walking boots and mountain gear -- was up by 68 percent and the Taylor Made golf equipment brand had a 77 percent increase in sales. Winter equipment, however, was down 16 percent. The Mavic cycle brand was up 4.1 percent.
Salomon had earlier forecast that its operating results for the 1996/97 year would be stable due to the cost of further diversification into snowboards with the aqcuisiion of Bonfire and the planned launch of new boards, shoes and fixtures in 1997 as well as new roller skates in 1998.
In the year to March 1996, Salomon made a net attributable profit of 308 million francs against 161 million last year.",0
"The planned sale of state-owned Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics has whipped up a storm of protest, which on Monday drove down shares in the Korean company's French partner Lagardere Groupe.
Lagardere shares closed nearly seven-percent lower on Monday on investor worries about the backlash of the Thomson sale that risks clouding the outlook for future French privatisations.
French opposition parties, labour unions and most French people, according to polls, are unhappy with the government's plan to sell Thomson SA, the world's fourth biggest television set maker and a leading defence group, to Lagardere and Daewoo for a symbolic one franc.
Thomson Multimedia workers protested against the deal on Friday and plan a demonstration in November against what they have likened to an enforced ""fire sale.""
The mounting opposition and the strongly nationalist tone, could augur badly for foreign buyer interest in future privatisations as the government prepares to sell insurer GAN, Credit Lyonnais and Air France.
The backlash also took the steam out of a rally in shares in Lagardere, which had risen as much as 32 percent after the government announced on October 16 that it had selected it over rival Alcatel Alsthom to buy Thomson.
Thomson has a 58-percent stake in defence group Thomson-CSF and 100-percent of Thomson Multimedia (TMM), a leader in new digital images technology.
""Lagardere is down because of the recent news articles that put in doubt the Thomson deal,"" a dealer said.
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said on Monday the procedure followed by the government was ""sheltered from all politicial criticism.""
The government tilted toward Lagardere's bid because of the defense connection. Lagardere plans to merge its Matra unit with Thomson-CSF and sell TMM to Daewoo -- also for one franc.
""The public authorities focused on the military aspect of the Thomson deal. They neglected the civilian (consumer electronics) aspect...it's now sticking in their throats,"" said the newsletter La Lettre de l'Expansion.
A survey of 1,004 voters published by the newspaper La Tribune found 72 percent disapproved of the sale price, saying it did not reflect TMM's value. Only 12 percent agreed with the government that the price was right given the group's debts.
TMM is saddled with the bulk of Thomson's debt, expected to reach 28 billion francs ($5.44 billion) by the end of the year.
Loser Alcatel broke its silence on Friday and said it would not have sold control of TMM to a foreign group but put together a 50-50 joint venture with an Asian partner.
""This new group would have formed the basis of a global industrial project in which French interests would have been solidly represented,"" Alcatel said in a statement.
The deal hinges on the approvals of France's Privatisation Commission and the European Commission, and speculation is rising that the privatisation commission -- which had been expected to make only a procedural review -- may turn into a more serious stumbling block.
The commission, a body of seven independent experts chaired by Pierre Laurent, has the mandate to ensure that any deal reflects the value of the company.
""Of course, they can disagree with the government,"" a Finance Ministry official said. ""If they agree, the deal can go ahead. If they disagree, the privatisation procedure has to be started over again,"" he added.",0
"South Korea's Daewoo Electronics on Thursday defended a proposed controversial deal to buy France's Thomson Multimedia by pledging to make investments in the company.
The head of Daewoo Electronics and the founder of its parent company tried to allay French fears through interviews in two leading French newspapers, promising hefty investment and a long term commitment to the country.
The chairman of Daewoo Electronics, Bae Soon-hoon, was trying to counter criticism about a South Korean company acquiring leading-edge French digital television technology cheaply. He said his company would spend at least 10 billion french francs ($1.9 billion) on TMM.
French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis meanwhile reaffirmed that the government was set on selling defence and consumer electronics group Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo even if Prime Minister Juppe wanted a public debate on the sale of the state group.
Juppe told parliament on Tuesday he would call a debate on the sale, for one symbolic franc, after an 11 billion franc ($2.2 billion) capital injection, in reaction to a public outcry and criticism from opposition parties and also from within his own coalition.
Arthuis dismissed criticism on the government's decision to sell the company by way of a private placement instead of a public sale.
""This is a company that could not be privatised through a public offer,"" Arthuis told reporters at a press briefing on Thursday. ""How could we ask several investors to bid on a company with a negative net value.""
Thomson has debts of some 14 billion francs.
Lagardere wants to merge Thomson SA's 58-percent-owned and profitable defence group Thomson-CSF with its Matra unit and sell loss-making consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia (TMM) to Daewoo Electronics.
The state's Privatisation Commission is currently studying both the preferred bid by Lagardere/Daewoo and one by Alcatel Alsthom and is expected to give its opinion in early December.
The chairman of Daewoo Electronics said his company would spend at least 10 billion francs on TMM in an effort to still the rising criticism about the deal.
""In total, the immediate cost of acquisition and recapitalisation of Thomson Multimedia for Daewoo is some 10 billion francs. But these 10 billion are only a first stage,"" Bae Soon-hoon told the La Tribune Desfosses newspaper, breaking his self-imposed silence on Daewoo's bid details.
He said South Korea and France had increasingly direct links, adding that French companies had sold the TGV high-speed train and nuclear power stations to his country and were planning to sell battle planes and other weapons.
France's trade minister Yves Galland is due to travel to South Korea on Monday to promote the country's economic interests during a trip lasting until Thursday.
France hopes to sell Dassault Rafale combat planes to South Korea to monitor its northern Communist neighbour.
Kim Woo-choong, chairman and founder of the Daewoo conglomerate, told France's Liberation newspaper in Seoul that big Japanese companies would want to see the Thomson deal fail.
""Certain big international electronics companies are against ths deal because they believe that the merger would make Daewoo too competitive,"" Woo-choong said, adding, ""These big companies are perhaps busy lobbying the French government.""
Liberation said he referred to Japanese companies.
""The French government cannot come back on its decision if there is not an important reason to do so,"" Woo-choong said.",0

A spokesman for Air France Europe, the domestic wing of the Air France operation, said the company had an 80 percent market stake on the routes it operates and 60 percent on the total French market.
But from April 1997, European liberalisation of the airline industry will fully throw open French airspace to competition.
The French government moved the door ajar at the start of 1996 by allowing competition on the busy Paris-Toulouse and Paris-Marseille routes which were controlled by state-owned Air Inter, part of the Air France group.
Other French airlines had been allowed to fly less busy domestic routes as well as European and international routes.
British Airways bought its first 49.9 percent stake in TAT in 1993 and obtained the remainder last July.
Air Liberte, AOM and TAT have all tried to carve out market share ahead of liberalisation with a price war against Air France Europe, the renamed Air Inter. As a result they have suffered financially.
AOM, headed by Alexandre de Couvelaire, had been in talks with Air Liberte with an eye to a merger but the worsening financial situation at Air Liberte, which sought creditor protection on September 26, made a deal impossible.
AOM, 99 percent owned by the Consortium de Realisation (CDR) which was set up to sell assets of bank Credit Lyonnais, is now going it alone with some 10 percent of the slot at Orly.
But industry sources said Air France could strike back in 1997 and make a bid for AOM to prevent another foreign airline from setting foot in France alongside British Airways.
Air France Europe plans to launch its ""Shuttle"" service between Paris and Toulouse next Monday, offering more departure times and a ""turn up and go"" service without reservations, as a major plank in its new commercial approach.
Other airlines in France are Air Littoral, owned by the Dufour family, the Dubreuil family's Regional airlines, Xavier Leclerq's Brit Airlines as well as Nouvelles Frontieres' Corsair and Euralair.
For Air France, these domestic lines are important potential feeder operations for its international operations.
Last week the company signed cooperation pacts with Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines Inc of the U.S. and Air France aims to sign a similar deal with an Asian ailrine in 1997.",0
"Cie Generale des Eaux on Tuesday launched its bid to become the main rival to state-owned France Telecom with the start a fixed telephone network in a residential quarter in the southern city of Nice.
Philippe Glotin, managing director of Generale's telecoms unit Cegetel, said the group aims to have a market share in 2003 yielding 40 billion francs ($7.9 billion) in annual sales, of which more than half would come from mobile communications.
In mobile telecommunications, Generale already competes with France Telecom with its SFR unit and it is allied to British Telecom Plc and MCI for business services.
SFR expects to have one million customers by March 1997, Glotin said.
The local residential market is expected to grow at a moderate pace but nevertheless represent 55 billion francs in 2003.
Glotin said he aimed at gaining a 40 percent share in mobiles, 20 percent in long-distance and 10 percent for so-called local loops, or small networks.
Cegetel, which counts BT, Mannesmann and SBC of the United States among its owners, has received permission from the French authorities for a telecoms experiment in Nice and from the start of 1997 it will offer residential telecoms services, using the DECT technology.
DECT, digitally-enhanced cordless telephone, uses radio waves to connect buildings to a telephone switch, while the connections inside the building are of the classical type using a telephone socket.
DECT is also available in totally wireless versions but the Nice experiment will not use this. DECT can handle high capacities and is relatively secure as far as privacy of calls is concerned.
Glotin said that Nice was the precursor of Cegetel's assault on France Telecom and the company would invest three billion francs in Nice and Paris to hone its skills ahead of market liberalisation in 1998. The Paris service is expected to be ready in 1998.
Cegetel is aiming to start its business in some 30 towns which will add up to a population of some 10 million inhabitants.
To part finance this five-year plan, Cegetel shareholders will inject 6.8 billion francs into the company at the start of 1997.
In business services, Cegetel is considering putting a local loop in the La Defense office complex on the Paris outskirts -- where parent Generale des Eaux is the main building developer.
In that area, MFS Communications Ltd already offers business services with a local loop in competition to France Telecom.
Glotin said that the success of Cegetel, or any other rival to France Telecom in France, depended to a large extent on the interconnection costs and other payments telecom operators have to make to France Telecom to use its installations.
Telecommunications minister Francois Fillon has started a wide consultation, set to end on November 30, in order to establish in early 1997 a price list of the services France Telecom can provide to its rivals.
""The level of the interconnection costs for us means either the right to live of the right to die,"" Glotin said.
Other future rivals for France Telecom are building and communications group Bouygues which has teamed up with Italy's STET. Bouygues started France's third mobile telecommunications service earlier this year.
AT&T has also expressed a desire to become a major force in the French market.",0
"The former long-time head of Britain's General Electric Plc said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday the group was ready to deal with whoever won ownership of state-owned Thomson SA.
The comments to the Les Echos newspaper by Lord Weinstock, GEC's chairman emeritus since September, followed a statement by Alcatel Alsthom chairman Serge Tchuruk that he was ready to make a new offer for the state electronics group if a December 31 validity deadline for current offers passes.
Tchuruk added he was willing to adjust his company's bid to recent developments and suggested the state might want to spread the privatisation of Thomson SA out over time.
In October, the French government decided to sell Thomson SA for one franc to Lagardere Groupe after a 11 billion franc ($2.1 billion) cash injection, instead of to Alcatel.
This decision awaits approval of the European Commission (EC) as well as France's Privatisation Commission.
While the EC decision could be due in the first half of December, the Privatisation Commission will not render its decision until after the Brussels' stance is known.
The French Finance Ministry has conceded that the entire operation may not be finished before December 31, a date after which theoretically both the Lagardere and Alcatel bids expire.
The announcement of a possible new Alcatel bid caused a slide in the company's shares, down 1.5 percent at 455.20 francs at midday, because investors did not like the new uncertainty.
Lagardere plans to merge Thomson's 58 percent-owned defence unit Thomson-CSF with its Matra Defence Espace unit while selling consumer electronics group Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo Electronics of South Korea for one franc.
The second sale has caused a public outcry and thousands of Thomson employees have protested in France's main cities, fearing for their jobs and severe Korean working conditions, despite job creation promises by Daewoo.
A group of Thomson workers in the western town of Angers are currently walking to Paris in a protest action, aiming to arrive in the capital in time for a December 6 shareholders meeting.
Part of Alcatel's plans were to combine the Thomson-CSF business with its own defence activities and then merge these with GEC's Marconi to create a defence electronics giant.
Weinstock said that neither Lagardere's plan to merge Matra with Thomson-CSF, nor Alcatel's defence activities with Thomson-CSF, would give spectacular effects.
""Only a merger between Thomson-CSF and Marconi would produce the necessary economies of scale and a good combination of products,"" he said, adding the combined company would have about $11 billion of annual sales.
Alcatel had said it intended to find a European industrial partner for Thomson-CSF. While the company has long standing links with GEC through GEC-Alsthom, Tchuruk did not want to exclude a link with Germany's Deutsche Aerospace.
In a statement, Foreign Affairs minister Herve de Charette formally denied his staff would have handed a report to President Jacques Chirac about an alleged dinner conversation between Weinstock and GEC chief executive George Simpson in which they allegedly planned to seize control of the new defence grouping.
Weinstock told Les Echos such a conversation had not taken place but said a report which contained a summary of the alleged conversation existed.
""Yes, that report exists and has been very damaging for the Alcatel position, people told us,"" Weinstock said.",0
"French diversified conglomerate Bouygues on Thursday said Italy's STET was joining its efforts to become a leading player in France's telecommunications market after full liberalisation of the sector in 1998.
Bouygues, active in construction, television and communication, said STET would take a 49 percent stake in a new joint venture with Bouygues, called Bouygues-STET, in which the French group would hold 51 percent.
This company, together with German partner VEBA, plans to bid to run the telephone infrastructure of French state railways group SNCF.
Bouygues will compete in French telecommunications with state-owned France Telecom, of which a 20 percent stake will be floated in April, and with CEGETEL the telecoms company majority owned by Generale des Eaux.
STET will also buy into the BDT holding company which is 51-percent owner of Bouygues Telecom. Bouygues said that BDT was valued at 13.75 billion francs and STET would during 1996 and 1997 pay 1.71 billion francs to buy new shares in BDT.
After this increase, Bouygues will have 59.5 percent of BDT, Jean-Claude Decaux International 20.9 percent and STET 19.6 percent.
VEBA has a 15 percent direct stake in Bouygues Telecom. Other stake holders are Cable & Wireless Plc, US West International and banks BNP and Paribas.
Last month, Generale des Eaux said it was forming a telecoms unit CEGETEL with British Telecommunications Plc, SBC of the United States and Mannesman AG of Germany.
Analysts have said they are also awaiting a move by AT&T on the French market.
France Telecom has Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp as partners.
Bouygues in May started France's third mobile telecommuncitions network, aiming at a 20 percent market share in the year 2000.
The activity in the French telecommunications sector are similar to alliances forming in Germany.
British Telecom Plc is allied to German utility Viag AG. On Wednesday, RWE dropped their company from an alliance with Veba and Cable and Wireless.",0
"GTE Corp. Wednesday said earnings rose 9 percent in the third quarter, boosted by strong demand for new phone lines from people setting up businesses or hooking up computers at home.
The results were in line with expectations, but GTE's stock jumped as investors cheered the report from the nation's largest local telephone company, as well a court ruling late on Tuesday that suspended key parts of federal rules designed to foster competition in local phone markets.
Other local phone company stocks also rose after the ruling by a three-judge appeals court panel in St. Louis. The judges said they had ""serious doubts"" about the Federal Communication Commission's authority to impose its pricing policies.
The FCC rules, among other things, would require the Baby Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.
Analysts said state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts. The appellate panel put the new rules on hold while it considers a court challenge to the FCC's plan.
The challenge to the FCC rules had been spearheaded by GTE, which was joined by some of the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.
""(The legal challenge) improves the probability for getting higher prices to resell local networks than under the FCC guidance,"" said Bette Massick at brokers Bear Stearns.
GTE jumped $3.625 to $42.25 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Other Bell stocks that rose included BellSouth, up $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic, ahead $2.125 to $60.875, Nynex, which gained $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech, up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis, which added $1.375 to $34.625, all on the NYSE.
In its report, Stamford, Conn.-based GTE said net income rose to $756 million, or 78 cents a share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $695 million, or 72 cents a share, in the 1995 period.
The results matched analysts' forecasts of 78 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates. The 1995 figures included a gain of $11 million, or 1 cent a share, from the sale of secondary telephone properties.
Sales grew 7 percent to $5.34 billion from $5.0 billion.
In addition to strong line demand, GTE cited growth in its cellular and long-distance services.
""The continued pace of our revenue growth, driven by record line growth as well as strong demand for new and enhanced services, is particularly encouraging,"" Chairman Charles Lee said in a statement.
The number of domestic access lines grew 7 percent in the quarter, with more than half the growth in the residential side of the business from additional lines to the home, GTE said.
GTE said its number of cellular customers grew almost 5 percent in the quarter, while cellular revenue surged 15 percent.
It also said it doubled its number of long-distance customers to more than 500,000 from the end of the second quarter.",0
"MCI Communications Corp said on Sunday its $20 billion merger with British Telecommunications Plc will give the combined company great strength in international calling, consulting and in U.S. local calling.
""Collectively we have the size and strength to compete with any telecommunications company in the world,"" MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told Reuters in an interview.
Maine, also a director at the new combined firm Concert, said putting together MCI's Systemhouse with BT's Syntegra would give huge power in consulting and systems integration.
""This is a scale game and this really positions us to compete with the likes of EDS (Electronic Data Systems Corp) and Andersen (Consulting),"" Maine said.
Analysts agreed MCI had a lot to offer BT in consulting.
""BT is getting its lunch eaten in U.K systems integration,"" said Danny Briere of consultancy Telechoice.
Maine predicted the deal could help hasten the end of the creaking international settlements system, which restricts the carriers and rates used on most of the world's international call connections and which keeps calls expensive.
""It positions us to take advantage what will probably be the coming collapse of the international correspondent relations market, which is the settlement system,"" he said.
The system is under siege because liberalisation is opening up domestic markets in several key countries like Germany, and new carriers domestically will want to get into the international calling market too.
Analysts say that as the international market opens up, calling rates for customers will fall.
Maine said there is big money to be made in the $90 billion a year U.S. local market as well, partly through MCI Metro, MCI's business market local calling subsidiary.
""If you want to look at return on capital there is no better investment BT could make than investing in the local market where we have 46 percent EBITDA margins,"" Maine said.
EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
""BT will invest through MCI into the local market and earn considerable returns on the capital, far more than I believe they could investing in their own market,"" Maine said.
He also expected that MCI's aggressive management team would be a great asset to BT, particularly in the U.S. market.
Maine said that on top of all the business advantages there would be a great deal of money saved by cutting out overlaps and inefficiencies between the two companies.
""Financially we have the synergies...$2.5 billion dollars over the next five years,"" Maine said.
Maine, who will be getting a board position at Concert, said that he was determined to make sure that investor relations (IR) efforts were kept up in the United States to avoid the shareholder base switching over too much to Britain.
""I believe its partly a result of the fact that the sell-side analysts who tend to follow the company tend to be those in the larger company. When you lose the sell side analysts you lose the involvement of the institutional sales forces,"" Maine said.
Telechoice's Briere said that the new company would tighten up a lot of areas which didn't work in the existing 20 percent stakeholding partnership.
""Huge areas will disappear now, where they had been duplicating effort,"" said Briere. He saw it as the right decision, and a brave one to make the partnership work.
""Now there will be no excuses,"" he said.",0
"John Walter believes that making strategies work within the machinery of AT&T Corp will be the core both of his job as chief operating officer and when he steps up to become chief executive (CEO) in 1998.
""You can have the greatest strategy in the world, but if you dont execute, it doesnt matter,"" Walter told Reuters.
Walter, chairman and chief executive of commercial printing firm R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co, was on Wednesday appointed by AT&T as president and chief operating officer, and heir apparent to AT&T CEO and chairman Robert Allen.  
Walter will immerse himself in the operations of AT&T during the 14 months when he and Robert Allen work as a team, and emerge capable of holding the reins.
""I'm very comfortable with my ability to move this enterprise forward,"" he said in a telephone interview.
Walter declined to outline areas where he believed AT&T had failed, but underlined achieving objectives and having an appropriate cost base as his clear focus.
""We have to have a cost platform which allows us to compete effectively or we are disadvantaged even before we come into the ring,"" he said.  
Analysts have repeatedly criticised AT&T's inability to meet its objectives, which has resulted in an erosion of the value of the brand name and a sliding share price.
AT&T has flung tens of millions in $100 checks at consumer long distance customers only to find them desert again to rivals in the industry. Its share in the $75 billion market has fallen to around 55 percent from 60 two years ago.
""They haven't had the level of execution on the consumer side that we should have seen,"" said consultant Chris Landis of TeleChoice, who is also an ex-AT&T executive.  
AT&T has made repeated attempts to make money in online services and the Internet, but has sold off almost all its creative content efforts and has retreated to a core offering of Internet access.
For every acquisition that worked well, like the 1994 purchase of McCaw Cellular, there have been others that failed, like the $7.5 billion 1991 takeover of NCR Corp.
Adjusted for the split-off of Lucent Technologies Inc, AT&T shares have fallen 16 percent this year, about the same as the broad market has risen.  
Among Walter's favorite quotes: ""When you hire, hire people better than you and then you'll build a company of giants. Hire people worse than you and you'll disappear.""
Printing industry analysts say Walter has used technology very effectively to make Donnelley grow, but some say growth came at a price.
""A lot of things have been going wrong,"" said one analyst, citing the lower earnings outlook and falling stock price.
But analyst Rudolf Hokanson of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said Walter was an effective manager.
""He tried to make people more accountable, tried to flatten some of the reporting structure,"" said Hokanson.",0
"Sprint Corp said on Tuesday  it put its local telephone ventures with cable television companies on a back burner because there are more immediate opportunities in reselling existing local telephone service.
""For a lot of reasons the wireline ventures with the cable TV companies moved ... to a back burner,"" Arthur Krause, Sprint chief financial officer told Reuters.
Sprint's cable partners are Tele-Communications Inc, Comcast Corp and Cox Communications Inc, which together reach 30 million households.  
They had planned to be an early part of Sprint's plan to offer bundled local, long distance and wireless telephone with cable TV on a single bill across the United States.
Krause said faster-than-expected legislative action from the Federal Communications Commission had opened up chances of earlier interconnection deals with incumbent local telephone companies than had been expected two years or so ago.
Some analysts believe there are technical and strategic difficulties too, which have already led to local services being arranged as several separate ventures rather than one common branded service as originally planned.  
Krause predicted Sprint's first such resale deal would precede any offerings of local service in partnership with the cable TV companies, but gave no exact timings.
He noted that resale was always a major part of the plan, because Sprint can only reach 11 million of the 100 million U.S. homes through its own local telephone service unit, and its cable partners reach only another 30 million.
Eventually local service would be provided broadly on Sprint-owned facilities, he said.  
Sprint reported third quarter earnings on Tuesday and pleased analysts with its operating performance, but the stock remains weighed by worries over its ambitious plans, like Sprint PCS, a multi-billion dollar wireless venture.
Krause said the market should see Sprint as two companies.
""We have been encouraging people to look separately at the core operation and at the ventures,"" he said.
Sprint's core telephone operations should be analyzed based on their earnings, while the new cash-hungry ventures  should be approached on a discounted cash flow basis, he said.  
""(Otherwise)...the value of the new ventures ends up as less than zero,"" he said.
Krause declined comment on estimates of dilution caused by Sprint PCS ahead of the finalization of the venture's 1997 business plan, which he expected within 30 days.  Analysts expect dilution of $450 miilion to $650 million in 1997.
Krause said he was encouraged that churn, or customer turnover, was declining in its long distance operations, particularly when others were being hit hard.
""(Nevertheless) churn rates still exceed what anyone would hope they would be,"" he said.
AT&T Corp said in September that high churn in this competitive marketplace was one of the reasons that it predicted an earnings shortfall for the third quarter.
Krause said Sprint's marketing encouraged customers to remain with the company.",0
"A $22 billion merger between British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp looks as good as agreed, crystallising the largest ever international business combination in record time.
Analysts and consultants said on Saturday that news of a London news conference at 8 a.m. EST (1300 GMT) on Sunday means the boards needed minimal time to wrap up the deal after the negotiations were reported on Friday.
MCI announced it would hold a news conference in New York at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT).
""At this point it really does sound like a done deal,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
At the conference, BT executives are likely to announce a $40 per share stock and cash offer valuing the 80 percent of MCI that it doesn't already own at $22.1 billion, and the entire company at $28 billion, analysts said.
If BT, with a market capitalisation of around 22.2 billion stg ($36.3 billion) uses mainly stock to foot the bill, it could mean MCI shareholders would own up to 37 percent of the combined company.
As a single company BT/MCI would be a true colossus, with revenues of $38 billion, 182,000 employees and a market value of $64 billion.
In the international big league it would be behind only Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp of Japan and AT&T Corp of the United States. In Europe, it would be roughly the same size as Deutsche Telekom AG.
MCI directors, meeting on Saturday in ""The Mausoleum,"" the name MCI staff give to their granite-domed Washington headquarters, have reason to be well pleased with the deal.
Analysts say MCI management will be left in charge of the U.S. market, and be given more money to fight in new markets and defend existing ones in the new deregulated environment.
""It is inconceivable to me that BT would change the MCI management,"" Kagan said.
For MCI the deal brings a 30 percent fillip to a stock price that had languished for almost two years, but for BT the benefits may be more symbolic than actual, analysts say.
""What does BT get for its $22 billion?"" asked David Goodtree of Forrester Research.
""You only need a global strategy to serve big businesses and they already have their Concert venture to serve that market. Other markets are regional,"" he said.
Economies of scale would be hard to find. Both companies already squeeze their suppliers to the limit, their brands are already strong in their respective markets, and geography and local market knowledge will continue to dictate fortunes.
According to one source close to the deal, staff numbers are not going to be cut as part of the deal, although existing job and cost cutting initiatives will continue.
A final hurdle, long thought insuperable to such a deal, is U.S. regulatory objections. But regulatory experts say the Federal Communications Commission itself opened a loophole earlier this year.
The FCC made a ruling that said bidders from truly open markets would be allowed to exceed the 25 percent limit on foreign ownership of U.S. media and communication assets.
""BT's home U.K. market is the most open in Europe and arguably the most open in the world,"" said Bill Gaik, telecommunications director for Deloitte & Touche Consulting.",0
"With most of their third quarter results in, regional Bells are fulfilling their promise to build out more telephone lines, to put more new services on each line and to make more money doing it.
Share analysts say the Bells and GTE Corp show no signs of slackening demand and are preparing themselves well for the challenge of full competition in their local markets.
""I would characterise the quarter as a cause for celebration in just about every instance,"" said Bill Vogel of Dillon Read, a long-time bull on regional Bell stocks.
Thursday saw results of Bell Atlantic Corp BellSouth Corp Pacific Telesis Group and SBC Communications Inc, following results on Tuesday from Ameritech Corp and on Wednesday from GTE Corp. NYNEX Corp and U S West Inc report next week.
Earnings per share growth averaged 8.25 percent, ranging from 3.0 percent at Ameritech to BellSouth's 12.5 percent. All were within a cent of analyst's First Call estimates.
""Generally the bottom line results have come in as expected,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst Julie Kennedy.
Annual access line growth has averaged 4.9 percent, well above levels seen in the 1980s and early 1990s, boosted by demand for Internet access, home computers, facsimile machines and extra business lines.
""The temporary scare the market had with Ameritech's line growth seems a one-off,"" said Kennedy.
Ameritech saw a dip in line growth to 3.7 percent from 4.4 percent from a year ago, but it followed a drop in advertising and seemed to reflect changed priorities, analysts said.
Pacific Telesis, which is being taken over by SBC, reported strong results which reflected a bounce-back in the California economy. The toll market, a problem area for the company in previous quarters, came good with stable market share and a 6.1 percent increase in revenues year-on-year.
Vogel said the market was absorbing competitive access providers (CAPS) like MFS Communications Co Inc and Teleport Communications LP, without hitting the Bells' growth.
""Results show that the main business lines of the Bells are untouched in both price and volume by the CAPS,"" he said.
Nevertheless, Bell shares remained muted on Thursday, with none of those reporting results moving more than 1.5 percent.
The Bells have underperformed the broad market this year, with analysts saying investors remain concerned about regulation and competition stemming from the 1996 Telecom Act.
This week's good news, in the shape of a legal challenge to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) jurisdiction over the pricing process for reselling local circuits to competitors, is still lost in the broader Bell worries.
The FCC has to review the prices the Bells can charge for access to their local customers in 1997.",0
"MCI Communications Corp is ducking the trench warfare in the consumer long distance telephone market by quietly using data warehousing  to target key customers who are unlikely to flee to the enemy.
MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine said these customers are looking for advanced services, preferably in a package, but have hitherto been hard to pinpoint.
""It has taken tens of millions of dollars and many years to develop profiles of customers who can be targeted in our marketing,"" Maine told Reuters in an interview.  
Data warehousing requires powerful computers to assemble profiles of users from thousands of individual spending decisions and was a technique first applied by retailers.
""I always tell investors it is a hidden asset you cannot put a value on,"" Main said.
Sales people use these profiles to sell new services to existing customers, or target those of rivals who are likely to move across for the right services -- and stay.
""We've done this for some time in the business sales force,"" Maine said.  
The main enemy is churn, the tendency for some customers to switch between providers, which wastes all the marketing, promotional and administrative money spent recruiting them.
Third quarter results on Tuesday from MCI showed the benefits in the business and data markets that account for two-thirds of MCI's total revenues, but it is early days to see much improvement in the consumer market.
MCI said churn was higher than a year ago in the consumer market, but lower than in the second quarter.  
While AT&T Corp slugs it out with tiny but tenacious resellers in a costly battle for customers using millions of dollars in promotional ammunition, MCI has cut its promotional spending for customer sign-ons by 70 percent from a year ago.
Maine said MCI One, a service package on one bill, has no sign-on bonus but half of new users take the Internet service. MCI One users are five times as likely to take cellular and calling cards than when services are billed separately.  
It is not just a land war. MCI has cross promotions with Northwest Airlines, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc, seeing overlaps between frequent fliers and heavy users of calling cards and wireless services.
Offering free air miles is much cheaper than offering cash, but just as alluring to certain markets.
""Our line-up gives us access to 70 percent of frequent fliers,"" said Maine.
Maine said that AT&T and Sprint Corp have been mining their databanks too, and the whole industry will have a headstart against the regional Bells, which are much newer to the game, when markets are all open to competition.
Despite all its data warehousing, MCI still makes errors.
MCI said it is in the process of revamping its paging services, which resell the networks of Paging Network Inc and Mobile Telecommunications Technologies Corp after it discovered heavy churn.",0
"AT&T Corp's proposed successor to Robert Allen as chairman and chief executive will be a surprise, not one of those whose names have been mentioned in the press, sources close to the company said on Wednesday.
Neither Michael Armstrong, President of Hughes Electronics Corp nor William Esrey, chief executive of Sprint Corp are in contention, despite broad press speculation.
The sources declined to identify the true candidate.
AT&T declined comment, as did Korn Ferry International and Spencer Stuart, the executive search firms involved.
AT&T's board met earlier in the day to examine a slate of candidates put forward by the executive search groups for the post of president and chief operating officer, and sources expect an announcement in the next few days.
AT&T reports its third quarter results on Thursday.
""The search had (already) been narrowed to a critical few... and the board, not just Bob Allen, will make the final decision,"" said one source, declining to be identified.
The post is vacant after Alex Mandl resigned in August to head a tiny new wireless company, Associated Communications.
One possibility is that Allen would split out the role of chief executive to the new candidate in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until nearer retirement.
Allen, a 32-year AT&T career veteran would be reluctant to depart early, but in a recent press interview said he would consider it if a perfect candidate came along.
""AT&T wants a world class marketer and technologist, with considerable experience of leading a major business,"" one source said.
It is unclear yet whether AT&T will give a clear succession timetable in the announcement for the new post.
Armstrong, Esrey, Eastman Kodak Co chairman George Fisher and James Barksdale, chairman of Netscape Communications Corp, have ruled themselves out of the candidature, but this has not stopped the speculation.
Expectation of an earlier end to Allen's career has been fanned by AT&T's profit warning in September in which it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts expectations.
The warning crowned a bad year for the largest U.S. telecommunications firm.
AT&T incurred the wrath of politicians and the media for announcing 40,000 job cuts in January, but an improved stock performance it was meant to produce has not appeared, so Wall Street and investors are not happy either.
While the company's split into three parts is going ahead as planned, the remainder of AT&T is now more firmly wedded to long distance telecommunications services sector, in which competition is hotting up.",0
"MCI Communications Corp., embracing merger partner British Telecommunications Plc  in a $20 billion match, is growing increasingly distant toward media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and their joint offspring.
At the same time, BT and MCI are seeking Asian telecom partners for Concert, their new global company.
MCI said on Sunday it would cut its stake in a U.S. satellite joint venture with Murdoch's News Corp from 50 percent to 20 percent.
MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts told Reuters that no major new launches were expected from the $400 million media joint venture with Murdoch's News Corp, and that MCI would sell to Murdoch a $700 million satellite license if it could.
MCI has a stake of just under 9 percent in News Corp, which it bought for $1.35 billion, and has an option to splash out an extra $1 billion to take this to 13.5 percent.
""It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp)"" Roberts told Reuters in an interview. He said that News Corp was aware of MCI's position.
This is all a world away from the first flush of enthusiasm when Murdoch and Roberts announced a broad-ranging alliance in May 1995.
The plan was to take the Australian magnate's publishing and television expertise and put it together with MCI's communications network and marketing skill, especially in the emerging market of the Internet.
But so far, the venture has produced some duds.
MCI's electronic malls on the Internet are now closed, and News Corp's ideas of producing supermarket tabloids to lure middle-aged readers to the Internet have been shelved.
Low-level cross-promotion, like advertising MCI calling cards in Murdoch's U.S. TV Guide, have continued.
The crux of the problem, analysts say, is that there never was much overlap between MCI's blue-chip business clients and Murdoch's blue-collar sports and publishing expertise.
""BT/MCI is going after the High Street, not Melrose Place,"" said Danny Briere, an industry analyst at consultancy Telechoice.
The satellite offspring American Sky Broadcasting (ASkyB) has been a problem child, expensive and slow to develop in comparison with some rivals.
In January, MCI and News Corp said they would offer digital television direct to the home across the U.S. market within two years, using the $700 million license MCI won in an auction.
But the same month, AT&T announced an alliance with General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics  DirecTV, a company that was already offering digital satellite services, and which now has two million subscribers.
MCI is clearly taking a second look.
""We would be willing, consistent with our lowering our investment position (in ASkyB), to move those to News Corp. That will take FCC approval,"" Roberts said.
BT Chairman Sir Iain Vallance said he expected to look hard for new partners to fill out the global telecommunications alliance in Asia.
""I think we will be more attractive to Asian partners than we would had we stayed separate,"" Vallance told Reuters in an interview. He declined to say which companies he had his eye on, but sources close to the company say Japan's NTT Corp. is considered the real prize.
Vallance said any partner would tie up closely to the business venture first.
""I think it is more likely that, in the first instance, we would invite partnership in Concert Communications Services rather than the parent itself,"" he said.",0
"Whoever takes over from Robert Allen as chairman and chief executive of AT&T Corp has a major task on hand to wake the sleeping giant, reverse its loss of market share and move strongly into new market opportunities.
""You need to do something to increase the growth rate at the margin, to throw out this rearguard mentality,"" said analyst Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns.
AT&T's core long distance market share has fallen to 55 percent from 60 percent in two years, while it has failed to capitalize profitably on the growth of new areas.  
""They need to get away from the price game; they cannot win that way,"" said Chris Landis, a consultant at TeleChoice Inc, and a former AT&T executive.
While AT&T made the right move into wireless with the purchase of McCaw Cellular, the integration of the products on one invoice is very important and has yet to happen.
""You need someone who can sell a bill because that is how you communicate with your customer,"" said Landis.  
Whoever is recruited to fill the vacant slot of chief operating officer, created when Alex Mandl left in August, will expect to take over as chief executive and chairman from Allen quickly, and will insist on a firm timetable.
""The problem is going to be getting the talent you need while Bob Allen is still around,"" said Landis.
Sources close to the company say AT&T has narrowed down its search to a shortlist of eager candidates -- none yet identified in the press -- but say an announcement is unlikely until the latter part of the week at the earliest.  
Television channel CNBC said Tuesday that Ameritech Corp's Richard Notebaert is the latest to emerge as a possible successor to Allen.  Ameritech said chief executive Notebaert was abroad and unavailable for immediate comment.
As a regional Bell chief executive he has powerful credentials for the post, but it remains unclear whether AT&T's search is focused within the industry, or would be broadened to a candidate with powerful marketing skills from some other industry.  AT&T, and the two executive search firms involved, Korn Ferry International and Spencer Stuart, have declined comment consistently on the succession issue.  
However, while the guessing game over successors has held sway in the press, it has been a snooze for investors, said analyst Bill Deatherage of brokers Bear Stearns.
""This is discussed much more in the press than by investors,"" Deatherage said.
He said that even if investors knew the candidate, it would be months at least before he or she would be able to have a discernible effect on the huge inertia in the corporation.
Some analysts have suggested that Allen may stay on as chairman while the new recruit rapidly steps up to become chief executive, but Landis thought Allen's continued presence would overshadow the new executive.",0
"MCI Communications Corp., the nation's second-largest long distance provider, said Friday it was in talks with British Telecommunications Plc on a possible merger of the two companies.
British Telecom already holds a 20 percent stake in MCI.
An MCI spokesman told Reuters the company expected the talks to be concluded this weekend, although he noted that there were no guarantees an agreement would be reached.
""We have entered into negotations with BT on a possible business combination,"" the spokesman said, reading from a prepared statement.
Industry analysts applauded the talks, saying a combination of the two companies would be a good fit in the super-competitive U.S. long distance phone industry, where MCI and No. 3 Sprint have been battling an ailing AT&T Corp.
""This is an extremely competitive business, and horizontal mergers like this make sense,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economic Advisors. ""The economies of scale in this case could be considerable, and the leverage in terms of potential profits is high ... It would be good purchase.""
MCI's stock was halted for trading at $27.25, up $1.875 on Nasdaq, although it jumped as much as $5 to $30.625 after CNBC television reported that the companies were talking. The exchange said it would investigate those trades.
""It would be a good fit for British Telecom and provide a major foothold in this country,"" said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.
""It wouldn't take away from the long-distance battle. Before that's over, there will be losers and winners,"" he added.
CNBC said Lazard Freres, MCI's investment bankers, and Morgan Stanley were working on the deal, which it said could be worth upward of $22 billion.
""It makes sense,"" said Kevin Haggerty, senior vice president and manager of equity trading at Fidelity Investments. ""I think BT is a great company.  The synergy is there. BT made a great initial investment.""",0
"AT&T Corp chairman and chief executive Robert Allen will step down early as the price of attracting a talented enough successor to take over, sources close to the company said on Friday.
The sources said that whoever is chosen to succeed Alex Mandl, who quit in August as president and chief operating officer, would expect to be able to succeed Allen, 61, well before the four years still to run on his contract.
""I think it is fair to assume that,"" said one source, declining to be identified.  
AT&T would not comment on the search for Mandl's successor and whether the candidate would succeed Allen.
""The search by the board is a private matter and we won't comment beyond that,"" said AT&T spokesman Jim Byrnes.
Analysts say one possibility is that Allen would split out the role of chief executive to the new candidate in a year or so but retain his chairmanship until retirement.
""I expect the (AT&T) system would allow and wish Allen to stay on in a senior official position for some time,"" said Mark Bruneau of consultant COBA MID.  
An ambitious candidate would wantct on the strategic direction of AT&T, one source said, noting he fast-changing telecommunications market may be barely recognizable in ars.
The sources declined to comment on who the candidates might be, but many aired in the media already seem to have ruled themselves out.
""There is probably more speculation out there than truth in the media at this juncture (on who the candidates are),"" said one of the sources.  
The AT&T board meets next Wednesday, a day before its third quarter results, and may discuss the issue then.
Allen, a 40-year AT&T career veteran, would be reluctant to depart early, but in a recent press interview said he would consider it if a perfect candidate came along.
AT&T has hired executive search groups Korn Ferry and Spencer Stuart to look for an outside candidate, but officials at the firms declined to comment on the process.  
Two candidates mentioned by the New York Times on Friday virtually ruled themselves out. William Esry, chairman of long distance telephone company Sprint Corp, said through a spokesman he was unaware of being on any AT&T candidate list.
""His contract with Sprint precludes working with competitors for several years after he leaves the company,"" the Sprint spokesman added.
Similarly, Hughes Electronics Corp said president Michael Armstrong was unaware of being an AT&T candidate.  
The Wall Street Journal reported that Eastman Kodak Co chairman George Fisher and former AT&T director James Barksdale, who is chairman of Netscape Communications Corp, also ruled themselves out of the speculation.
Expectations of an earlier end to Allen's career have been fanned by AT&T's profit warning in September, in which it said earnings per share for the third quarter may be 10 percent below analysts' expectations.
The warning crowned a bad year for the largest U.S. telecommunications firm.  
AT&T incurred the wrath of politicians and the media for announcing 40,000 job cuts in January, but an improved stock performance it was meant to produce has not appeared, so Wall Street and investors are not happy either.
While the company's split into three parts is going ahead as planned, the remainder of AT&T is now more firmly wedded to the long distance telecommunications services sector, in which competition is heating up.",0
"British Telecom and MCI Communications on Sunday announced a $20 billion merger, using the largest cross-border takeover deal in history to spawn a global telecommunications powerhouse.
The merged company, to be called Concert Plc, creates the world's second-largest telecommunications group, based on market capitalization, behind Japan's NTT Corp.
Valued at $54 billion based on Friday's closing stock prices, Concert is neck-and-neck with U.S. long-distance leader AT&T Corp., which is MCI's arch-rival in the super-competitive U.S. market.
For customers, the deal promises better service and lower international calling charges, while for businesses it means a company that can support them wherever they are. For for shareholders, it means faster earnings growth, analysts said.
""This is not a pebble we're throwing onto a quiet pool. It is a big rock, and it's going to make a big splash,"" Sir Iain Vallance, chairman of British Telecommunications Plc, told a news conference in New York.
The deal values all of Washington,D.C.-based MCI at a total $25.2 billion. But as British Telecom already owns 20 percent, it will issue Concert stock and cash worth $20.1 billion for the 80 percent it does not own. Holders of this MCI stake will thus control 33 percent of the stock in the combined company.
Because the companies have already worked together for three years, they expect the merged company to function well.
""Mergers don't always work, but this one will,"" Vallance added.
AT&T, which would be the hardest hit by a financially muscular enlarged rival, said it was confident any MCI/British Telecom deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government and called on both U.S. and European regulators to condition approval of the deal on a further freeing of competition in British Telecom's home market.
Already strong in long distance, MCI hopes to use BT's service and back-up expertise, plus plenty of cash, to help take a big chunk of the $100 billion a year U.S. local calling market from the regional Bells.
That market is expected to gradually open to competition following legislation earlier this year. Since 1984 it had been the monopoly of the seven regional Bells.
MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts said he was confident the combination with British Telecom would win the approval of federal regulators, noting that ""the U.K. is the most competitive telecommunications market in the world.""
He added that the deal would result in lower expenditures for both companies because ""costs will be reduced by building networks once, not twice."" The companies expect to save $1.5 billion in costs over five years.
Employees, usually tense during mergers, can relax.
""Minimal job cuts, that is the joy of this. MCI will operate in the Americas, and BT will operate in the U.K and the rest of the world,"" Vallance told Reuters.
Concert Plc would be one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, with 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.
""The complementary strengths and skills of BT and MCI will enable Concert to take full advantage of the great opportunities provided by the forthcoming liberalization of the telecommunications market in the U.S. and Europe,"" said Vallance.
Under the terms of the agreement, which has yet to be approved by regulatory authorities on either side of the Atlantic, MCI shareholders would receive 0.54 new American Depositary Shares in the new combined group for every MCI share. Each Concert ADS is equivalent to one British Telecom American Depositary Share and $6 cash.
British Telecom's ADSs closed at $55.50 in New York on Friday, giving a value of $30 per MCI share, plus $6 in cash per share before the effect of a buyback by British Telecom that is part of the deal, MCI Chief Financial Officer Doug Maine told Reuters.
British Telecom said Concert will buy back up to 10 percent of its shares after the deal closes. The maximum buyback would increase the value of the deal to MCI shareholders to $39.60 per MCI share. MCI's stock closed Friday at $30.25 on Nasdaq.
The new company, incorporated in Britain, would have headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the British Telecom and MCI brand names.
British Telecom has been looking for a major acquisition since its proposed merger with British rival Cable and Wireless failed in May. It had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world's fastest-growing market.
Analysts now expect British Telecom and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
But while seeking an Asian partner, MCI is putting another one on a backburner.
MCI is to cut its stake in a U.S. satellite venture with Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch to 20 percent from 50 percent, and will not increase its stake in Murdoch's News Corp as originally expected.
""It is unlikely you will see us increasing our investment (in News Corp),"" Roberts told Reuters.
MCI paid $1.35 billion for a stake of just under 9 percent, and could increase it to 13 percent with another $1 billion investment.
Roberts added that if U.S. regulatory permission could be obtained, he may even sell the $700 million license that goes with the U.S. direct-to-home broadcast satellite to Murdoch.",0
"AT&T Corp. Chairman Robert Allen is likely step down early to help attract a talented enough successor to take the helm of the nation's largest long-distance company, sources close to AT&T said Friday.

AT&T's split into three parts is proceeding as planned, leaving the company to concentrate on its core long-distance telecommunications business, where competition is heating up.
While the Dow Jones industrial average is up nearly 17 percent so far this year, AT&T shares -- adjusted for the company's breakup -- are off 16 percent.
AT&T has hired executive search groups Korn Ferry and Spencer Stuart to seek an outside candidate. Officials at both firms declined to comment.",0
"Long distance and local telephone company Frontier Corp. said on Monday it is investing up to $500 million in a $2 billion fiber optic network being built across the United States.
Frontier said it will be the largest fiber optic network built in the United States as a single project, and will put it ahead of AT&T Corp., MCI Communications Corp. and others whose networks include both old and new technologies.
Lucent Technologies Inc., spun off from AT&T Corp. in September, will supply the network cable. That contract is worth at least $100 million, a source close to the deal said.
The network is being built by privately owned Qwest Communications, which began work in 1995 and has already spent $500 million. Qwest said it is open to other telecommunications partners to help fund the remaining $1 billion.
The network will connect almost 100 cities and use the technical standard known as SONET, or Synchronous Optical Network, which gives high performance and reliability.
""Used in a ring, SONET allows you to recover from a network failure in milliseconds,"" said analyst Christine Heckart of consultants TeleChoice. ""This investment will expand Frontier's network reach to customers it was hard to get at low cost,"" she said.
Frontier, based in Rochester, N.Y., currently leases its network from others. But it expects to be able to cut costs significantly by this investment, which will increase its network capacity forty-fold.
Robert Barrett, president of Frontier's Network Systems unit, said the network would begin to bring benefits in 1997, halving network transport costs, and cutting incremental network costs by 80 percent.
""Clearly it makes better sense for us to own the network,"" Barrett told a teleconference.
Qwest, a company specializing in network construction, is based in Denver, Colo. It is a subsidiary of Anschutz Co. Anschutz's owner and chief executive is Philip Anschutz, the largest shareholder in Union Pacific Corp.
Frontier will fund $350 million to $400 million of its investment from its own cash flow, and may use short- and medium-term debt for the remaining $100 million to $150 million.
Frontier's stock lost 25 cents to end at $27.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"With AT&T Corp losing market share and floundering in new markets, Wall Street had been expecting a well-known industry leader to take over from Chairman Robert Allen and turn the company around.
Instead, AT&T has recruited a relative unknown, John Walter, chairman and chief executive of R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co. He may be up to the job, but the market will be kept guessing for 18 months while Allen serves out his time.
""He may be exactly what they need, but we won't know for a while,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.  
Analysts and consultants say Walter is well respected but has never faced the scale of challenge he will find at AT&T, which bestrides the crossroads of communication, software, computing and the Internet.
""AT&T is the biggest battleship you have ever seen. Donnelley is not a small company, but AT&T is 10 times the revenues and has three times the employees,"" said David Goodtree, a consultant at Forrester Research.
AT&T appointed Walter as its new president and chief operating officer, effective November 1.  
But he will not take over as chief executive from Allen until January 1998. Four months later he will become chairman at AT&T's annual meeting.
""Allen does have an image problem, though I don't have that opinion of him,"" said Barry Sine of SBC Warburg, who cut his rating on AT&T stock to hold from buy today. ""The long handover period is an issue for the market.""
AT&T's share in the $75 billion long distance telephone market has fallen to around 55 percent today from 60 percent two years ago. Marketing stumbles hurt earnings in the recent third quarter, and investors are losing patience, analysts say.  
AT&T stock was down two points at 37-7/8 at noon EDT/1600 GMT in heavy volume. Adjusted for the split-off of Lucent Technologies Inc, AT&T shares have fallen 16 percent this year, about the same as the broad market has risen.
Sine said of Walter, ""This is not a candidate to lead the rally.""
Analysts say top candidates to succeed Allen, such as George Fisher of Eastman Kodak, may have been put off by the lengthy 18-month transition time while Allen remains in charge.  
""I heard the reason Fisher didn't take the job was the 18-month delay before taking the reins,"" Kagan said.
However, a source close to AT&T, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no tentative or firm offer was made to any candidate who subsequently withdrew. AT&T declined comment on the matter.
""I was expecting 12 months (handover) at most,"" said Chris Landis, an analyst at consultancy Telechoice Inc and a former AT&T executive. ""I think most insiders were too.""  
Walter has qualities and experience that AT&T will be able to make good use of, analysts said. His printing company specialized in high volumes and quick turnarounds.
""That's a good quality to have at AT&T because you are talking about billions of phone calls a month,"" said Goodtree.
Donnelley is a formidable user of technology and has used telecommunications to transform its business. It is also a significant customer of AT&T.
Cable & Wireless Plc Chief Executive Richard Brown spoke favorably of Walter.  
""I think AT&T is fortunate to get John Walter,"" Brown told Reuters. ""John Walter is a leader...He know the telecoms world but he is not directly involved. He's a quick study.""
On the downside, there is the huge leap of scale and the different nature of AT&T's business. Donnelley is a project-based company, while AT&T is a process-based company requiring different management techniques.
While Walter has made great inroads in the business market where Donnelley finds its customers, he has little experience in consumer markets where AT&T is having its biggest trouble fighting off aggressive competitors.
In an interview this summer, Allen told Business Week magazine that he would be prepared to step down early ""if we find God, or something short of that..""
John Walter has found some adherents at AT&T, but the stock market is not yet ready for a conversion.",0
"Like an ageing prizefighter, AT&T Corp is destined to slug it out with vigorous rivals both big and small in the $75 billion long distance telephone arena, with no lift in earnings performance in sight.
Though AT&T has just started to improve its marketing punch, share analysts say by the time it shows up in earnings it will be facing fresh opponents -- muscular regional Bells.
""It is hard to find a positive medium-term outlook for AT&T,"" said Bette Massick of brokers Bear Stearns, adding that more attractive stocks could be found elsewhere.  
Thursday's third quarter earnings were in line with analysts' estimates, revised after September's profits warning.  But few analysts give hope for a quick profit rebound now that the company's fortunes are so clearly tied to its long distance marketplace.
AT&T earlier reported a 12 percent earnings per share decline to $0.84 from $0.96 a year ago -- with increased competition and higher marketing expenses hitting long distance -- while financial services sank into losses.  
""I don't see much earnings improvement next quarter or in the first two 1997 quarters,"" said Simon Flannery of brokers J.P. Morgan.  The shares were 1/2 lower at $39-3/8.
AT&T said it has been encouraged by early responses to its new $0.15 a minute flat price for long distance, and analysts say this should stem the weakness for now.
AT&T has a higher proportion of revenues from the consumer long distance market place than its two archrivals MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp.  
The spinoff of Lucent Technologies Inc in September and of NCR Corp at the end of 1996, plus numerous unit sales, can only tighten the dependence.
Companies like GTE Corp -- which took half a million long distance customers in its first six months -- and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp are entering the market in a big way, mostly in the consumer area.
They join hundreds of tiny aggressive companies like Excel Communications Inc, which lease the circuits of the big players and then compete with them at low prices.  
By the second half of 1997, dependent on the state of a legal tussle over U.S. Federal Communications Commission resale rules, regional Bells will be starting to enter the long distance market themselves.
By this time AT&T, like other long distance players, is hoping to offer local calling using the circuits of the regional Bells. But the legal challenge led by GTE may succeed in shutting the FCC out of the resale pricing process.
""If so, it will cost AT&T more to get into the local market,"" Massick said.  
Major players by then will be starting to offer packages including wireless, local and long distance and in some cases satellite or cable television too, all on one bill.
This should shut out some of the small resellers and throw the fight onto brand names, where AT&T should be strong -- but the outcome is far from clear, analysts say.
In the meantime, they are hoping for strong action at the loss-making Universal Card credit card unit.
""The credit card business was very disappointing; that's something to watch going forward,"" Flannery said.",0

"Third quarter results at both MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp will be restrained by the cost of new ventures, and in Sprint's case the issue of new shares will lower per share earnings.
But analysts say both have so far escaped the problems which have hit AT&T Corp in the consumer long distance market, and which led to AT&T's profit warning in September.
""MCI will have increased earnings, but will continue the second quarter trend of slower long distance volume growth,"" Massick said Bette Massick of brokerage Bear Stearns.  
Sprint's earnings per share are expected to be lower than a year ago because of investment in the international Global One venture and in Personal Communications Services.
Sprint's shares in issue will rise to about 435 million, from 351 million a year ago, because of stock issued to partners Deutsche Telekom  DTK.CN and French Telecom.
MCI's heavy investment in media, Internet and satellite services with News Corp Ltd is not expected to break even for several years.
""The dilutive effects of the MCI ventures will increase year over year,"" Massick said.  
AT&T said on September 24 that earnings per share could be as much as 10 percent below analysts' forecasts of $0.92 per share for the third quarter.  If this fear were realized, it would report earnings of $0.83, 13.5 percent below the $0.96 of a year earlier.
Analysts say AT&T's problems were an expensive and flawed consumer market strategy of trying to win customers by offering them $100 checks and the competitive effect of small, fast-growing resellers and ""dial around"" services.  
Resellers include companies like Excel Communications Inc, which have produced 50 percent-plus annual revenue growth by using independent sales representatives to sell to friends, family and associates.
Dial around is so named because customers use a 1-800 number to access a rival service advertising cut price rates for long distance or international calling, without switching their long distance provider.
The long distance giants do not lose the customer, but notice a fall in average billable revenue.  
MCI expects higher customer turnover in consumer markets because of increased competition. But neither it nor Sprint depends as heavily on the consumer market as AT&T does.
Merrill Lynch analyst Dan Reingold said in a research report that demand demand for Sprint's services is robust.
""Our forecast minute (of use) growth rate of 9.1 percent should be almost double the industry average...indicating that Sprint continues to take market share,"" Reingold said.
By contrast he expected AT&T minutes of use to grow by 6.2 percent from a year ago, and revenue on this to rise just 1.5 percent.
This growth gap of 4.7 percentage points would exceed the 3.4 percent of the second quarter, he said.
Analysts say Sprint and MCI are not immune to the threat from dial around and resellers, but in any case the threat will be contained in the next two or three years.
""I think the idea of packages or bundles of services will be very much a threat to the small dial around competition because they won't be able to compete up and down the product chain,"" said Guy Woodlief of brokers Dean Witter Reynolds.  
AT&T's adoption of a flat rate 15 cent long distance charge should help it regain market share, especially against Sprint, which charges a flat 25 cents during the day.
Such is the danger is adopting a clear pricing policy -- when more than one major competitor does it comparisons become easy and can lead to a downward spiral in calling charges.
""Given AT&T's brand position in the market place, it is going to remain a formidable competitor,"" said Woodlief. Company   (all in dollars)    Q3 est   yr ago  results date

"The keys to WorldCom Inc's $14 billion takeover of MFS Communications Co Inc are savings on duplicated costs and a chance to be the first with end-to-end service in U.S. businesses telecommunications.
WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers acknowledged that there was a substantial premium in the stock terms offered for MFS but said savings would soon cover the cost of the deal.
""It is not to say that price isn't important, but it really depends on how quickly you pay for it,"" Ebbers told Reuters in an interview on Monday.  
MFS, with local networks in dozens of major U.S. cities, was in a unique position to outflank the regional Bell's lock on access to local business customers. It was in a position to get the terms it wanted.
""There aren't a lot of MFS's out there,"" Ebbers said.
""He (Ebbers) had the only one sizeable company to merge with whose stock we really wanted (to own),"" James Crowe, chief executive of MFS, told reporters.
WorldCom stock soared a heady 57 percent a year over the last ten years. MFS has grown 41 percent a year in the three years since it was floated.  
Ebbers said savings and new market opportunities would mean the deal would pay for itself within five or six years, though for the first three years, 1997-1999, earnings per share would be diluted, but solidly accretive thereafter.
Worries that the stock transaction was too generous for MFS hit Worldcom stock, which was 3-3/4 or 15 percent lower at 22-5/8 in early afternoon. MFS soared 10 to 44-7/8, with both atop the active shares list on Nasdaq.
Ebbers said communicating the deal's advantages may take time. ""If that happens we will have a significantly increased stock price from where we are today,"" he said.  
UUNET, the internet service provider which MFS completed buying earlier this month, will have the biggest savings.
Now it can provide both local and long distance connections without having to pay fees on outside networks. These fees had previously swallowed up half of its revenues.     Most
importantly, the combined company MFS WorldCom can present a comprehensive business package without having to use the networks or pay the fees of others.
End-to-end service is the promise of the U.S. deregulation which became law early this year, but neither AT&T Corp nor any regional Bell can yet achieve it either because of regulatory checklists or negotiating tussles.
""We think this gives us at least a two-year headstart over our competitors,"" Ebbers said.
By being first, Ebbers expects to reap wholesale business from the regional Bells and GTE Corp, companies which at a retail level are its competitors.",0
"Quarterback Doug Flutie led the Toronto Argonauts to a 43-37 victory over the Edmonton Eskimos and the championship of the endangered Canadian Football League on Sunday.
In what may have been the last Grey Cup game, the Argonauts overcame a driving snowstorm and a gritty Eskimo club to capture their first CFL championship since 1991.
Flutie, named the Grey Cup's most valuable player, silenced critics who labelled him a fair-weather quarterback after the Argonauts lost last year's bitterly cold championship game to the Baltimore Stallions.
The former Boston College star and Heisman Trophy winner as U.S. college player of the year also won the CFL's most outstanding player award this week after leading the Argonauts to a 15-3 season, the league's best record.
""That's the full package. That's what has been missing the last few years,"" Flutie said after winning his second Grey Cup since 1992 when he was with the Calgary Stampeders.
Flutie completed 22 of 35 passes for 302 yards and made a 10-yard scramble for a touchdown.
Canadian newspapers have reported that the CFL's new salary cap may prevent Toronto from paying Flutie's annual salary of $1 million Canadian (about $750,000 U.S.) -- the highest in the league.
The snowy, slippery contest was a typical Grey Cup in which weather played a critical role. The steady snowfall blanketed Hamilton's Ivor Wynne Stadium for most of the game and kept field crews busy.
Despite the conditions, it was the second-highest scoring Grey Cup game. The highlights included a 91-yard kick return by the Eskimos' Henry ""Gizmo"" Williams which set a new Grey Cup record.
The championship capped a chaotic, money-losing season which left many fans wondering if they will see the venerable Grey Cup next year.
""After a game like this, it would be a real shame if the CFL folded,"" said parka-clad Bob Forbes, one of 38,595 spectators who huddled against the weather.
Despite returning to its Canadian roots this year after a failed expansion into the United States, the CFL is dripping red ink.
The Grey Cup was not a sell-out, and all but one of the CFL's nine clubs will lose money, due to dwindling crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season.
The 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded in Canada's capital at the end of the regular season.
The cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players' wives to the game.
Average CFL attendance slipped to around 22,000 fans a game from 24,400 in 1995, despite a slick ""Radically Canadian"" marketing campaign trumpeting the league's national heritage.",0
"Three Canadian financial institutions on Tuesday launched North America's first city-wide, reusable ""smart"" card designed to replace cash in retail transactions.
The Exact card will be tested under a pilot programme operated by Bank of Montreal, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canada Trust, a unit of CT Financial Services Inc.
The project will be in Kingston, Ontario, city of about 100,000 people located 168 miles (270 km) northeast of Toronto.
About 600 Kingston merchants -- including convenience stores, gas stations and fast food outlets -- signed up with the test project.
The consortium is advertising Exact as an alternative to cash, credit and debit cards. Canadians currently spend between C$40 billion ($29 billion) and C$60 billion ($44 billion) using small coins and bills.
""With Exact you don't have to carry as many small bills and coins, and you'll always have the exact change required to make fast, convenient purchases,"" said Ron Hodge, vice president of card and direct services for TD Bank.
Canadians are among the biggest users of plastic cards in the world. They carry an estimated 46.2 million debt and credit cards, while use of these cards has jumped 43 percent in the past year, according to a recent industry survey.
""Technology is rapidly changing the face of money, providing faster, easier and more secure transactions. This is only the beginning,"" said Tim Hockey, vice president of core banking services for Canada Trust.
Exact will be followed in early 1997 by a community-wide test of Mondex, a rival ""smart"" card system developed in Britain. Exact is based on smart card technology developed by Belgium-based Banksys.
Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce will roll out their Mondex system in Guelph, a city of about 100,000 people 50 miles (80 kms) west of Toronto.
Both systems are similar in that they involve storing money on a computer chip embedded within a card. When a customer uses the card to make a purchase, the value is subtracted from the card.
Customers simply insert their card in the merchant's special, hand-held purchase terminal. The merchant enters the purchase price and the customer presses the ""OK"" button.
The electronic value of the sale is collected in the purchase terminal and transferred via telephone modem to the merchant's bank account at the end of the day.
Exact users can load, or electronically transfer cash from bank account to the card, up to C$200 ($147) from terminals in the Kingston branches of Bank of Montreal, TD Bank and Canada Trust. Load terminals will also be located in shopping malls, student campuses and selected stores.
The card will initally be offered at no charge. But after an introductory period, each financial institution will set a fee for its own customers.",0
"Toronto, Canada's biggest city and financial capital, is bracing for a near shutdown Friday when protesters hit the streets against deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.
The so-called ""Days of Protest"" on Friday and Saturday are shaping up to be the biggest labour protest in Canada since the Winnipeg General Strike in 1919 in which one person died and 30 were injured after a confrontation with police and the army.
In a bid to paralyse this city of 2.2 million people, organisers hope to close businesses and disrupt services, including underground trains and Toronto's Pearson Airport, the country's busiest airport.
Thousands of unionized workers, civil servants and activists will picket outside the Toronto Stock Exchange, government offices, corporate headquarters and factories.
""I must tell you to prepare for days of inconvenience and frustration Friday and Saturday,"" Alan Tonks, chairman of Metro Toronto, said in a letter to residents on Thursday.
Ironically, the labour chaos comes as Toronto basks in the glow of being chosen by Fortune magazine as the world's best city for quality of life.
The protesters are furious with the government's plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.
Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.
""We want to put pressure on the government and its corporate supporters that we're not going to accept this anymore,"" Linda Torney, co-chairwoman of the ""Days of Protest"", said in a telephone interview.
Premier Mike Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution.""
City officials were bracing for a disruption of Toronto's bus and subway services, which handle about 1 million commuters a day. Transit officials on Thursday won a partial injunction against picketing at subway stations.
GO Transit, the train service that links suburban communities to Toronto, warned commuters that ""service may be delayed, adjusted, interrupted or even cancelled.""
Air travellers can also expect delays at Pearson Airport, which handles about 65,000 passengers a day, said airport spokesman Bruce Reid.
A Canadian court ruled Wednesday that picketers cannot interfere with essential airport workers, but can set up informational pickets. Airlines have promised to re-schedule flights if there are significant delays.
Meanwhile, several major manufacturers have cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant will be off the job Friday.
The protest will not affect General Motors Corp.'s Canadian unit, which is getting back to work after a nearly three-week strike ended earlier this week.
The Breeders' Cup, a major international horse-racing event on Saturday, will not be affected by the protest.
On Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community, traders not lucky enough to get a scarce hotel room are planning to sleep in their offices.
""Some essential people will be in the office. They might grab a couch or a sleeping bag,"" one broker said.
Other firms are sending their employees to offices outside Toronto or telling them to work from home. Many workers are expected to take the day off.
The Toronto Stock Exchange, Canada's biggest stock exchange, is planning a ""business-as-usual day,"" despite a large rally planned outside the exchange.",0
"Canada's Big Six banks are cruising toward a record C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) annual profit with strong earnings from three banks and buoyant profits expected from Canada's two other largest banks next week.
Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia -- the number three and four banks respectively -- cracked the C$1 billion ($740 million) mark this week.
Toronto-Dominion Bank fell short of the billion dollar club, but Canada's fifth largest bank still turned in a record year.
The profit parade continues when Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce deliver their results on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
""They will have whopping earnings. They will be record earnings, rest assured,"" Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with TD Sercurities Inc., said on Friday.
National Bank of Canada, the smallest of the Big Six, also reports its earnings next Thursday.
Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank and TD posted double-digit increases in net income this week -- with strong growth in personal, corporate and investment banking. The earnings so far have been in line with analysts' forecasts.
""There were no surprises. Just really solid quarters from everybody,"" said CIBC Wood Gundy analyst Mark Maxwell.
The banks' investment, brokerage and mutual fund businesses enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.
Royal Bank's investment arm. RBC Dominion Securities Ltd, has already posted a record profit. RBC said on Thursday its earnings jumped to C$154.3 million ($114 million) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, up from C$77 million ($57 million) a year ago.
""In addition to two major mergers...each of our four global businesses turned in strong performances contributing to record results for the year,"" said RBC president Reay Mackay.
RBC recently completed its C$480 million ($355 million) purchase of brokerage firm Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., and merged some operations with parent Royal Bank.
CIBC's investment unit is also expected to post bullish earnings when the bank reports its results next week.
Analysts said earnings growth for the Big Six is expected slow in 1997, particularly if bond and stock markets cool off.
However, TD Bank expects the boom to continue. ""The current low level of interest rates should result in increased economic activity in Canada in 1997 and the gradual return of consumer confidence,"" said TD president Charles Baillie.
More dividend hikes are possible next week following increases at Scotiabank and TD.
Scotiabank raised its payout by C3 cents (2 cents) to C37 cents (27 cents) a share, its second increase of 1996. TD boosted its dividend by C3 cents (2 cents) to C28 cents (21 cents) a share.
""I would be astonished if CIBC did not increase its dividend at this time,"" said Palmer. CIBC last raised its dividend by C5 cents (4 cents) to C45 cents (33 cents) last June.
Maxwell said there is less pressure on Royal Bank and National Bank to raise their dividends now, but an increase may come in early 1997.
Improved credit quality also contributed to bottom lines of Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal and TD.
All three banks reported lower loan loss provisions for 1996. TD surprising analysts with a deeper-than-expected drop in its provision to C$152 million ($112 million) from C$180 million ($133 million) in 1995.
Analysts said loan losses for the Big Six appear to have touched bottom and are expected to creep higher next year.",0
"Shivering icewine enthusiasts, battered by icy winds, headed into a snow-covered vineyard on a recent night to harvest one of the world's rarest wines.
Although Germany discovered the luscious dessert wine in the late 18th century, Canada is the world's largest producer of icewine -- capturing many international awards and helping shed an industry reputation for screw-top plonk that neither amuses nor has any pretentions.
If you can find it, this ""liquid gold"" can cost up to C$200 ($150) a bottle in icewine-crazy Japan -- four times the price in Canada. Japan is by far the biggest export market, but China and South Korea are also developing a taste for it.
But on this cold winter night a cup of piping hot coffee could fetch a better price than any chilled wine. ""It's cold, hard work. You're outside in the dark picking frozen grapes and wondering why you're not asleep like normal people,"" Greg Berti, general manager of Hillebrand Estates Winery, said on a recent midnight tour of Hillebrand's icewine fields.
Most of the Canadian vintage comes from the Niagara wine region where 24 wineries produced 29,700 gallons (112,500 liters) in 1995. That is up 57 percent from 1994 but paltry compared to the eight million gallons (30 million liters) of regular wine produced yearly in Ontario, Canada's most populous province.
Some California wineries produce sweet wines but they are shunned by icewine purists because the grapes are artificially frozen. ""Their wine is interesting, but it's not in the same league as icewine,"" Berti said.
IT MAY BE RARE BUT IT TASTES LIKE PEACHES
Although Niagara wineries say their products are unique in taste, icewine is generally amber or golden in colour with a full-flavored taste similar to honey, apricots or peaches. It is thicker than regular wine, with an alcohol content of about 10 percent, compared to 40 percent for a cognac or brandy.
Canada exports icewine to Germany, Denmark, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States. China and Korea are also emerging markets. But the biggest buyers are Japanese tourists who flock to the Niagara region by the busload -- snapping up several bottles of icewine after a visit to nearby Niagara Falls.
Hillebrand sells about 75 percent of its icewine to Japanese who tour its winery. ""Their image of Canada is Banff, Anne of Green Gables and Niagara Falls, and icewine fits in with that image,"" Berti said.
Last summer, a group of 74 Japanese race horse owners descended on another Niagara winery and drove off with more than $10,000 worth of icewine. ""They came into the winery, sampled, bought and were back in their bus in 45 minutes,"" recalled Debi Pratt, director of public relations for Inniskillin Wines Inc.
ALMOST AS HARD TO PRODUCE AS GOLD
It takes every grape from an entire vine to yield enough juice to make one bottle of icewine -- 10 times the amount used to make regular wines. Many grapes are lost to hungry birds, hail or harsh winter winds before they are picked.
But Canada has plenty of what is needed most to make icewine -- consistently cold weather.
The grapes -- hardy Vidal or Riesling varieties -- must be picked off the vine when temperatures are well below freezing.
Most wineries set aside part of their vineyards in October when the regular wine harvest ends. By mid-December or early January the shriveled grapes have turned a brownish hue and pickers are on call, waiting for the right weather.
Berti said Mother Nature has sometimes forced crews to pick on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve -- although that did not happen this year.
""The wind is the biggest problem. Every hour or half hour we take a break for hot coffee and donuts,"" Gregory Synos, a six-year veteran of the icewine harvest, said.
The grapes are sorted and rushed to the winery where presses work into the night. The juice then goes through several weeks of fermentation, followed by a few months of ageing in oak barrels to smooth out the acidity and tanins in immature icewine.
Although Hillebrand has tried to modernise the process by using special presses and protective netting for the grapes, Berti conceded: ""There is nothing efficent about it. You have to get into the fields when the getting is good.""",0
"Anti-government protests swept across Canada's biggest city on Friday as demonstrators in Toronto shut down the transit system, disrupted businesses and tried to break into the Toronto Stock Exchange.
""We've come to the place where the real power is ... They get their power and strength from inside this building,"" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange.
Demonstrators chanted ""Shut it down, shut it down,"" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors.
Protest organisers later moved the rally away from the doors of the exchange.
In another part of the city, Ontario Finance Minister Ernie Eves said it was ironic that some of the groups that are protesting have huge pension funds that invest in stocks.
Protesters hit Toronto streets, paralysing rush-hour subway trains and closing businesses in Canada's biggest city to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government.
Subway and bus service ground to a halt in this city of 2.2 million people, forcing about one million commuters to walk, drive or cycle to work or just stay home.
Unionized workers, civil servants and social activists also descended on government offices and factories in the first day of the so-called ""Days of Protest"" against budget cutbacks.
But picketers failed to disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Expected traffic jams on the city expressways also did not materialise.
In the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community.
At least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.
Other companies hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities.
The protesters are furious with Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a huge deficit by the turn of the century.
Since sweeping to power in 1995 promising a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments, introduced workfare and announced plans to close hospitals and trim education budgets.
""These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,"" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.
But Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution.""
""Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,"" Harris told reporters.
The Conservatives' popularity has held at around 50 percent in recent opinion polls.
Many commuters took the delays in stride.
""I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,"" said John Ivarey.
A poll taken this week found that 67 percent of Toronto residents opposed the ""Days of Action"" rallies.
Protesters waved placards and temporarily blocked cars from entering government parking lots, but Toronto police said there were no major incidents of violence.
One man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat outside a bus garage. There also were skirmishes outside a postal station.
Several major manufacturers cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc. , said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant would be off the job Friday.",0
"Profits at Canada's six big banks topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) in 1996, smashing last year's C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) record as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada wrapped up the earnings season on Thursday.
The six banks each reported a double-digit jump in net income for a combined profit of C$6.26 billion ($4.6 billion) in fiscal 1996 ended Oct. 31.
But a third straight year of record profits came amid growing public anger over perceived high service charges and credit card rates, and tight lending policies.
Bank officials defended the group's performance, saying that millions of Canadians owned bank shares through mutual funds and pension plans.
Shareholders of four of the six banks were rewarded with healthy dividend hikes this year.
""Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy,"" CIBC chairman Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday.
CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, said net income climbed to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) in fiscal 1996 from C$1.01 billion ($743 million) in 1995.
CIBC also boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents (3.6 cents) to C50 cents (37 cents), the second increase in 1996.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada previously raised their payouts as well.
Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion).
Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively.
National Bank, the smallest of the big six, posted a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million ($234 million) this year.
The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses also enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.
Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996.
The group's earnings and dividend hikes were in line or slightly better than analysts' forecasts.
""It was good news and a fairly good outlook for 1997 in terms of earnings and dividends,"" said Hugh Brown, a banking analyst with investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc.
Brown said he now had a more positive outlook for bank earnings in 1997, saying Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent next year, up from previous growth forecasts of about 7 percent.
Bank stocks, which have led the Toronto Stock Exchange to new heights since September, fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market. CIBC led the decline, dropping C$2.50 ($1.84) to close at C$57 ($42) in brisk trading.",0
"Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, said Tuesday that it would take a huge C$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) charge in 1996 to strengthen its financial structure.
The debt-laden, Ontario government-owned utility said its board of directors also approved a C$600 million ($440 million) charge against 1997 earnings.
The charges, related to accounting and operational changes, come as the ruling Conservative government of Canada's most-populous province ponders the privatisation of the massive utility.
The heavy writedowns add up to an estimated 1996 net loss of C$1.9 billion ($1.4 billion), Ontario Hydro said in a statement. The utility previously forecast net income of between C$600 million ($440 million) and C$625 million ($460 million).
""These decisions are driven by our determination to improve nuclear performance and to make capital and policy decisions that enable us to succeed in the business environment we face,"" said Ontario Hydro Chief Executive Officer Allan Kupcis.
He said the move will not affect Hydro's ability to pay down its debt, estimated at more than C$30 billion ($22 billion) due to overexpansion.
Ontario Hydro is the continent's largest electricity producer based on installed generating capacity and one of the world's biggest non-sovereign borrowers.
It operates 96 hydro-electric stations, five nuclear plants and six fossil-fuel stations.
But competitive pressures from within and outside Ontario have forced changes on Hydro in recent years.
Last June, a government commission recommended that Ontario Hydro lose its 90-year power monopoly and face competition from private Canadian power suppliers and U.S.-based competitors.
Among the operating decisions made Tuesday, the utility said it will scale back or cancel some projects. The biggest single charge was a C$1.2 billion ($882 million) writedown reflecting the costs of surplus heavy water at its nuclear operations.
The decisions will not affect employee staffing levels at the utility.",0
"Veronika Hirsch, a flamboyant Canadian stock picker whose high-profile move to Fidelity Investments was marred by controversy, parted with the Boston-based fund company on Tuesday.
""We've concluded the discussions and Fidelity wishes Ms. Hirsch well in her future endeavours,"" Fidelity spokesman Chethan Lakshman said in a telephone interview.
Hirsch was a star fund manager hired last summer to spearhead Fidelity's drive to dominate the Canadian market.
But Canada's so-called ""Fund Diva"" was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company.
Lakshman did not give details of the agreement with Hirsch, who has kept a low profile since her investments in a small Vancouver company, Oliver Gold Corp., grabbed headlines and the attention of regulators last November.
Hirsch's lawyer, Tom Lockwood, said on Tuesday that she is weighing her options, including offers to go on the lecture circuit or write a book.
""There's private money management prospects and there are mutual fund prospects. There have been a number of approaches made and she's considering what she will do next,"" he said.
At issue was Hirsch's purchase of 65,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold through a private placement while she was a fund manager with AGF Management Ltd. in Toronto.
Shortly after the warrant purchase, Hirsch's AGF Growth & Income Fund bought 295,000 special warrants of Oliver Gold at more than double the price paid by Hirsch, according to filings with the British Columbia Securities Commission and reported by Stockwatch, a Canadian investment publication.
Fidelity removed Hirsch from her True North Equity Fund last November after Canadian securities regulators confirmed her personal investments were under investigation.
The dramatic move came barely three months after Fidelity poached Hirsch from AGF to lead its expansion drive in Canada where it ranks ninth with C$8.2 billion ($6.1 billion) in assets.
Canadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year, analysts forecast.
While at AGF, Hirch was the focus of a multi-million dollar advertising campaign which made her Canada's top celebrity fund manager.
When Hirsch jumped to Fidelity, her leather outfits and blood-red nails appeared an uncomfortable fit with Fidelity's ultra-conservative culture, but the hiring was considered a major coup within the industry.
Hirsch's old True North fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$280 million ($208 million) in assets since its launch last September.
While analysts have said it is difficult to assess the damage to Fidelity's expansion drive, the Hirsch affair has changed how fund companies sell their product.
Brash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the ""team"" is in, analysts said.",0
"""The Times They Are a-Changin"" -- Bob Dylan's counter-culture anthem of the 1960's  -- is being used in a commericial for a Canadian bank and some fans are up in arms.
The Bank of Montreal is running a television commercial using the American singer's 1964 folk classic to lure baby boomers into the country's third biggest bank. The TV spot shows children running down country roads and across lush fields as a choir sings Dylan's song.
The commercial ends with a Bank of Montreal logo and the promise of a big announcement on Oct. 16.
The new campaign has drawn fire from Dylan fans angry that a big institution has co-opted this protest song from their youth. But a senior bank official said Dylan's lyrics reflect the bank's desire to change in the 1990s.
""Our view is a bank has to change because the times are changing. We thought the lyrics caught rather nicely the imperative for large institutions, like banks, that they face having to change,"" George Bothwell, senior vice-president of public affairs, said in a telephone interview.
Some callers to a morning radio show in Toronto were outraged at the ad campaign. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. played the commercial and Dylan's version, then asked listeners for their reaction.
""I was appalled. The bank failed to understand the spirit of the song. It has so many associations for people our age. I hope they reconsider. They went over the line with this one,"" one female caller said.
Another listener said: ""Bob Dylan, I can only say, shame on you.""
Dylan still owns the copyright to the song but was unavailable for comment.
Some younger callers said aging baby boomers have only themselves to blame.
""I don't know why you're surprised. You had high ideals when you grew up. Then you started making money and buying cars. And all the ideals are no longer convenient so you sold out. Every single one of you. Dylan is just doing what everyone is doing,"" a young listener said.
Another caller scoffed at the controversy: ""Baby boomers spare us the crocodile tears. A lot of people have sold out.""
One listener found it ironic that in these tough economic times a bank would use a song that warned: ""You better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone.""
Canada's big banks, which are on track for a third straight year of record profits, have been criticized for high service fees and tight lending policies.",0
"Canada's six biggest banks are poised for a further round of buoyant profits when they begin reporting third-quarter earnings Tuesday, setting the stage for a third consecutive record year, analysts said.
An improved interest rate picture, higher investment banking and dealing revenues and better loan quality are expected to drive profits in the third quarter ended July 31.
On average, earnings for the so-called Big Six are expected to be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than the third quarter of last year, analysts said.
""I would expect more sectors of the banks to be more profitable than they were in the corresponding quarter of last year,"" said Roy Palmer, an analyst with TD Securities.
Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third- and fourth-largest banks, respectively, kick off the earnings parade on Tuesday.
Canada's fifth-biggest bank, Toronto-Dominion Bank, and the smallest, National Bank of Canada, report on Thursday.
The country's top two banks, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, are scheduled to deliver their results Sept. 5.
Despite a recent downturn in financial markets, analysts said securities earnings should be stronger than last year. Canada's brokerage industry is dominated by subsidiaries of the countries major banks.
The banks are also expected to benefit from lower loan losses as the industry continues to rebound from disastrous loans in commercial real estate, which collapsed in the late 1980's.
Despite the correction in stocks earlier this summer, bank stocks have remained strong performers. Lower Canadian interest rates have helped push bank stock prices to all-time highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
""I think that if the combination of strong profitability couples up with lower interest rates, then it probably will set the backdrop for higher share prices,"" said Susan Cohen, an analyst with Deacon Capital Corp.
Analysts said they do not expect any of the banks to raise their dividends during the reporting period.
But the string of record bank profits are expected to yield dividend hikes at the end of the fiscal year.
The big banks are on track for a third straight year of record annual profits. The group rang up a combined profit of C$5.17 billion in fiscal 1995 ended Oct. 31, up from C$4.25 billion a year earlier.
As for 1997, Palmer said he expects a modest increase in profits.
""Investment banking is a cyclical business. It may tail off a bit, but there is no sign of a recession yet, so I would think we could get modestly higher earnings next year,"" he said.
Bank of Montreal is expected to report a third-quarter profit of 97 cents Canadian (70.8 cents) per share, up from 93 cents Canadian (67.9 cents) per share a year ago, according to figures supplied by the International Brokers Estimates Service.
Scotiabank's earnings are seen climbing to C$1 (73 cents) per share in the third quarter, up from 86 cents Canadian (62.8 cents) a share.
Toronto-Dominion Bank is expected to post a 72 cents Canadian (52.5 cents) per share profit, up slightly from 71 cents Canadian (51.8 cents) per share in the third quarter of 1995.
National Bank's third quarter earnings are forecast to rise to 41 cents Canadian (29.9 cents) per share from 33 cents (24.1 cents) Canadian a share a year earlier.
CIBC's third quarter results are pegged at C$1.42 ($1.04) a share compared to last year's C$1.13 ($82 cents) per share.
Royal Bank of Canada is seen improving to 96 cents Canadian (70 cents) a share in the third quarter, up from 88 cents Canadian (64.2 cents) per share a year earlier.",0
"Royal Bank of Canada, the country's largest bank, rolled up a record annual profit Wednesday and surprised shareholders with a dividend hike.
The Toronto-based bank said net income jumped to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion) in the year ended Oct. 31, from C$1.26 billion ($931 million) in 1995.
Royal Bank also boosted its quarterly dividend by C3 cents (2 cents) to C37 cents (27 cents) a share, the third increase in the past 15 months. It was the third Canadian bank to raise its dividend recently.
Royal Bank was the fourth of Canada's Big Six banks to post a third straight year of record profits.
Results from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada, which are due on Thursday, were expected to push the group's earnings past the C$6 billion level ($4.4 billion), up from last year's record C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion).
""We're announcing strong results ... and this dividend increase is evidence of our commitment to rewarding shareholders and enhancing shareholder value,"" Royal Bank Chairman John Cleghorn said in a statement.
Higher asset volumes, lower credit losses and strong performances from wealth management and investment banking fattened Royal Bank's bottom line.
The bank's brokerage arm, RBC Dominion Securities Ltd., turned in a record year due to strong financial markets.
Royal Bank's credit quality also continued to improve. The provision for credit losses fell C$140 million ($103 million) to C$440 million ($325 million) in 1996 and was expected to fall more in 1997.
Royal Bank continues to seek an acquisition in the United States, but soaring stock prices have made it very expensive.
""Indeed in some sectors of wealth management, some of the asking prices have gone right out of sight,"" Cleghorn told reporters during a conference call.
Royal Bank's fourth-quarter earnings were slightly better than analysts' estimates.
Earnings rose to C$1.09 (80 cents) a share in the quarter from C90 cents (66 cents) in the same period in 1995. The consensus forecast from analysts was about C$1.04 (77 cents) a share.
Royal Bank's dividend increase surprised some analysts who expected the bank to wait until early next year.
The bank is in the middle of a massive share buyback that analysts said had become expensive due to the recent surge in Canadian bank stocks.
""It (the dividend hike) is rather surprising. Maybe they won't be going as far with the buyback and this is compensation,"" said Roy Palmer, a banking analyst with investment dealer TD Securities Inc.
But Cleghorn said the bank will continue with its buyback of up to 10 percent of its common stock.
""We have not indicated any upside price to analysts or the press and we are continuing with our buyback programme,"" he told reporters.
Despite the strong results, Royal Bank's stock fell along with a sagging Toronto Stock Exchange Wednesday. The bank's shares closed down C65 cents (48 cents) to C$48.25 ($35.68).
In New York, Royal Bank's stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $35.625.",0
"A furry hedgehog, idyllic sunsets and the meaner streets of Budapest seem unlikely moneyspinners, but such images are crowding Canada's airwaves as the annual mutual fund season kicks into gear.
Armed with high-powered ad campaigns, eager fund sellers are vying for the billions of dollars Canadians will pour into registered retirement savings plans (RRSPs).
With interest rates at 40-year lows and stocks at stratospheric heights, investors are expected to shun interest-bearing investments for higher yielding mutual funds before the March 1 deadline for RRSP contributions.
""We're in the thick of it right now and it's going to get busier and busier toward the end of the (RRSP) season,"" said John Wiltshire, vice-president of marketing for Investors Group, Canada's top fund company with C$25 billion ($18 billion) in assets.
TAX BENEFIT IS A DRAW
Canada introduced RRSPs in the late 1950s to allow people without registered pension plans to save for retirement. Investors can deduct the amount from their taxes for the previous year's income.
Besides being a tax benefit, RRSPs have become more popular as traditional pension benefits are scaled back.
Canadians have more than C$211 billion ($156 billion) stashed in mutual funds, an eight-fold increase from 1990. An estimated C$23 billion ($17 billion) will be added to the pot this year.
Fund companies also expect a big chunk of the C$250 billion ($186 billion) currently invested in guaranteed investment certificates and term deposits to shift into funds.
In what has become an annual rite of the Canadian winter, fund sellers flood the airwaves with promotions, hype and gimmicks to lure RRSP dollars. But, unlike the United States, Canadian broadcast rules prohibit companies from making performance claims on television or radio.
""That's why you get fuzzy advertising. They talk about lifestyle and emphasise branding,"" said John Kaszel, director of research for Investment Funds Institute of Canada, a lobby group representing 40 fund companies.
Soft-sell ads feature happy people in tranquil settings with simple messages such as ""We're here to get you there,"" or ""quietly creating wealth.""
NEXT GENERATION THE TARGET
Some firms are targeting the next generation of investors. GT Global, a member of Liechtenstein Global Trust, launched a Kid's Kit in December to teach youngsters about mutual funds.
When a parent opens a minimum C$500 ($370) account, his child gets a stuffed ""Henry the Hedgehog"" toy, a certificate and a colourful book explaining ""Henry's Mysterious Gift.""
""This is a chance to give a gift to your kids that is tangible and gets them into the habit of investing,"" said CT Global President Joe Canavan.
Other ads feature smartly tailored people using words such as ""discipline"" and ""performance"" to trumpet their firm's investment strategy.
Spectrum United Mutual Funds' gritty commercials highlight its team of tough global fund managers, including one who scored a big success investing in a Budapest security company.
To add levity to the RRSP season, Bank of Montreal's campaign pricked the balloons of so-called ""experts"", but there was little information on the bank's own funds.
Critics complain that Canada's advertising rules insult investors' intelligence.
""Mutual fund regulators are convinced that mutual fund investors are ignorant dolts who need to be protected from themselves and the industry. The result, as far as radio and television are concerned, is a multimillion dollar river of non-information,"" Toronto Globe and Mail columnist Terence Corcoran wrote recently.
SCANDALS MAY MEAN TIGHTER CONTROLS
But regulators are unlikely to relax their grip on the industry. In fact, the rules could tighten after recent scandals such as the Veronika Hirsch affair.
Hirsch was a star stock picker hired last summer to spearhead Boston-based Fidelity Investments' drive to dominate the Canadian market. But she was removed from her portfolio in November amid a controversy over personal trades she made before joining the world's biggest mutual fund company.
Fidelity also offered clients their money back without penalty. ""We were pleased that the number of people who did take advantage of it was less than our expectation,"" said spokesman Chethan Lakshman, but he did not give any numbers.
Hirsch's True North Equity Fund is now under a less flamboyant manager and has accumulated C$211 million ($156 million) in assets since its launch last September.
Hirsch's status was under discussion, Lakshman said, but a separation package was rumoured to be under negotiation.
FALLOUT PROMPTS GUIDELINES REVIEW
The fallout from the Hirsch affair prompted a review of the industry's guidlines for fund managers. ""It has opened up some concerns, but those are being addressed. Now we are seeing whether more should be done,"" Kaszel said.
While analysts said it was difficult to assess the damage to the industry's credibility, the Hirsch affair changed how companies sell their product.
Brash campaigns built around high-profile stock pickers are out and the ""team"" is in, analysts said.
Canada's Big Six banks are also heavy advertisers this year as they strive to become bigger players in a industry dominated by independents.
Three banks are now among the top 10 firms, with Royal Bank of Canada number three behind Investors Group amd Trimark Investment Management Inc.
The banks were allowed to enter the mutual fund business in 1987 and now account for 29 percent of the industry's assets. Fund management fees have helped propel bank profits to record highs in recent years.",0
"Anti-government protests swept across Canada's biggest city Friday as demonstrators in Toronto shut down the transit system, disrupted businesses and tried to break into the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Thousands of union workers, civil servants and other citizens descended on government offices, transit stations and factories across the city, organisers said.
Over 1 million commuters stayed at home, walked, drove or cycled to work after the city's subway and bus services were shutdown, officials estimated. City officials said transit services would resume early Saturday.
But picketers did not disrupt commuter trains from Toronto's bedroom communities or interrupt service at Pearson Airport, the country's busiest. Instead of the traffic jams on the city expressways which had been expected, ""It was like a Sunday afternoon,"" one city official said.
Toronto police said there were no major acts of violence, though a few people were arrested, mostly for misconduct.
The so-called Days of Protest was organised by labour unions to protest deep budget cuts by Ontario's Conservative government affecting many of this city of 2.2 million people.
Some critics said the protest did not succeed.
""Today's protest was a flop. Yes. They inconvenienced a lot of people, but they failed to shut down the city,"" said Colin Brown of Ontarians for Responsible Government, a right-wing lobby group.
""Hundreds of thousands of people didn't come to work and that is what counts,"" said Aleda O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the organisers.
Ironically, the labour unrest came after Fortune magazine called Toronto the city with the world's best quality of life.
Most of the protests were peaceful, but hundreds of demonstrators tried to smash into the Toronto Stock Exchange, a symbol of the business community that has supported the government's tough fiscal policies.
Protesters chanted, ""Shut it down, shut it down,"" as they pounded on the glass doors of Canada's biggest stock market. One man wearing a mask and combat fatigues was seen hurling himself against the doors.
Riot police were moved into the vicinity of stock exchange, but did not intervene. Rally organisers later moved the raucous group away from the doors of the exchange.
""We've come to the place where the real power is ... They get their power and strength from inside this building,"" Jim Stanford, an economist for the Canadian Auto Workers, told hundreds of protesters outside the exchange.
In the days leading up to the protest, a siege mentality gripped Toronto's Bay Street, the heart of Canada's financial community.
At least one brokerage firm flew traders to its offices in New York and Montreal, while other brokers slept in hotel rooms or in their offices overnight.
Other companies, including the Globe and Mail newspaper, hired boats to ferry employees across Lake Ontario from nearby communities.
The demonstrators expressed fury at Ontario Premier Mike Harris' plans to cut spending by C$8 billion ($5.9 billion) to wipe out a big budget deficit by the turn of the century.
Since coming to power in 1995 on the promise of a right-wing revolution in Canada's most populous province, the Conservatives have revamped labour laws, slashed welfare payments and required recipients to work, and announced plans to close hospitals and cut education budgets.
""These cuts that Harris made are hurting the workers. This is part of the polarisation that is happening in Ontario. The anger is going to grow and grow,"" Syd Ryan, president of the Ontario division of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told picketers outside a government building.
Harris, who has been dubbed ""Newt of the North"" in reference to Republican U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, has vowed the protests will not stall his ""Common Sense Revolution.""
""Will they discourage us from creating more jobs? No. Discourage us from workfare? No. That's what we were elected to do and I don't expect that most of the public want us to change from that agenda,"" Harris told reporters.
The Conservatives, who hold their annual convention in Toronto this weekend, have seen their popularity hold at about 50 percent in recent opinion polls.
Many commuters took the delays in stride.
""I see the protesters have a point, but I think it's going to inconvenience a lot of people who don't have any other choice,"" said John Ivarey.
Police said one man was charged with a weapons offence after allegedly threatening picketers with a baseball bat and five protesters were charged with public mischief.
Several major manufacturers cancelled day shifts. De Havilland Inc., a unit of transportation firm Bombardier Inc., said 6,200 employees at its Toronto aircraft plant would be off the job Friday.
Other companies that closed Toronto operations included school bus operator Laidlaw Transit Inc., auto parts firm A.G. Simpson Co. Ltd., and candy maker Nestle Canada Inc.",0
"Toronto stocks soared to new heights on Wednesday, powered by a rally in bank shares as foreign investors stampeded into Canada's financial markets, lured by falling interest rates and a recovering Canadian economy.
Shares in Canada's big six banks hit 52-week highs on the Toronto Stock Exchange, propelling the country's biggest stock market to its 53rd record close of 1996.
The Canadian dollar has also surged this week, hitting its strongest level since October 30, 1995.
Declining interest rates, low inflation and falling budget deficits have combined to make Canada the flavor of the month, economists said.
""Overall, foreign investors have just become enamored with Canada as a place for investment,"" Michael Gregory, an economist with Lehman Brothers, said in a telephone interview.
The Toronto Stock Exchange jumped 85 points to close around 5749, fueled by brisk action in interest-rate sensitive issues such as banks and utilities.
The key 300 Index has gained more than 20 percent this year, compared to about 19 percent for the Dow Jones Average and 16 percent for the Standard & Poors 500.
The Bank of Canada is expected to ease interest rates again as early as this week. The central bank has cut rates 19 times since May 1995 in a bid to revive a sluggish economy.
Bank of Canada Governor Gordon Thiessen said on Wednesday that Canada's improving economy gives the central bank more latitude to set Canadian rates independent of U.S. rates.
He added Canada is now in a better position to withstand a hike in U.S. rates than it has been in recent years.
""The economic outlook is favorable. We will soon see signs of the payoff for the difficult restructuring decisions taken in both the private and public sectors,"" Thiessen said.
After several years of belt tightening, Canadian governments have either balanced their budgets or are on track to wipe out huge deficits.
Canada's 1.2 percent inflation rate is one of the lowest in the world and less than half the U.S. rate.
Several Canadian banks cut residential mortgage rates on Wednesday to levels not seen in about three decades.
Gregory said he expected Canada to continue to outperform the United States on the rate front and that offshore investors recognized that. ""I think investors are coming to terms with the fact that Canadian interest rates -- because of low inflation and improving currency prospects -- should be below U.S. rates,"" he said.
""Many investors are jumping on that and the Canadian dollar is undervalued. It's cheap,"" Gregory said.
The Canadian currency closed around C$1.3312 (US$0.7512) on Wednesday after trading around C$1.3300 earlier in the session. The dollar broke through C$1.3300 on Tuesday, its strongest level since October 1995.
In stocks, the country's big six banks have been big beneficiaries of favorable interest rates and the overseas scramble to buy Canadian stocks.
The TSE's financial services group jumped 2.5 percent on Wednesday after soaring three percent on Tuesday. The sector has gained nearly 1,400 points since September.
Declining interest rates make bank lending more profitable and bank dividends more attractive for investors.
Soaring bank profits have also lured investors. The major banks report their year-end results in a few weeks and are on track for a third straight year of record profits.
Recent listings on the New York Stock Exchange have given Canadian banks a higher profile in the United States where they are considered cheap compared to U.S. bank stocks.
New York-based Morgan Stanley issued a bullish recommendation on two Canadian banks on Tuesday and predicted a strong fourth quarter for the entire group.",0
"The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Index reached its 50th record close of 1996 on Thursday and broke the 5600 barrier for the first time.
The TSE 300 Composite Index rose 8.01 points to close at 5598.82, surpassing a streak of 45 record finishes in 1987.
The Index also breached the 5600 barrier, setting an intraday high of 5601.88.
""It's just another record in a string of more to come. This won't be the last,"" said Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president and director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc, a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia.
Toronto's record-setting run was led by banking, communications, conglomerates and technology issues. Of the TSE's 14 sub-groups, 10 finished higher.
The rally was restrained by 162-point loss in golds.
Trading was brisk with 113.8 million shares exchanging hands for a value of C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion).
Advancing stocks outnumbered declines 538 to 434 with 294 issues unchanged.
Traditionally, October has been a scary month for investors who remember the massive crash of 1987.
""This is the time when everything is supposed to fall apart, but it has been a rather strong month,"" Ketchen said.
* Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada set all-time highs as the bank group continued their climb since summer. Scotiabank closed up 0.45 at 42.25 after reaching a 52-week high of 42.40. Royal Bank added 0.60 to close at 44.30 after hitting a 52-week peak of 44.40.

"The Canadian Football League is set to hold what many fear may be its last Grey Cup championship on Sunday after a chaotic, money-losing season.
The championship between the Toronto Argonauts -- led by former Boston College star quarterback Doug Flutie -- and the Edmonton Eskimos, is the 84th league title game.
But some wonder if there will be a Grey Cup next year.
Despite returning to its Canadian roots this year after a failed U.S. expansion, the CFL is dripping red ink. All but one of its nine clubs will lose money, due to small crowds and cash bailouts to keep teams in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver afloat during the 1996 season.
The 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise folded earlier this month at the end of the regular season.
So precarious are the league's finances that the cash-strapped Eskimos could not afford to fly players' wives to the Grey Cup game in Hamilton, Ontario, 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Toronto.
""The LAST Grey Cup?"" asked the Toronto Star, Canada's biggest newspaper, in a front page story on Friday.
Some say the CFL needs the bigger and richer National Football League to survive.
CFL Commissioner Larry Smith said he is interested in ""building a relationship"" with the NFL, but that the CFL will not become a Triple A minor league.
""I have no interest in a farm system. If we could have some developmental relationships like we've done in the past with guys like Warren Moon and Joe Theismann, then that would be great,"" Smith said in a telephone interview.
Moon and Theismann were star CFL quarterbacks in the 1970s and 1980s before jumping to the NFL.
""What we have been doing is exploring some ideas on ways we could possibly work together. But we have not reached an agreement on anything at this point,"" said Greg Aiello, director of communications for the NFL.
CFL purists fear closer ties with the NFL would threaten the distinctiveness of Canadian-style football.
Canada's game closely resembles the U.S. brand, but there are a few key differences. The playing field is longer and wider. Canadian teams get only three downs instead of four to gain 10 yards and keep possession of the ball.
There are 12 players a side compared to 11, and single points are awarded for missed field goals not run out of the end zone.
Football writer and former CFL player Frank Cosentino said the NFL could help pay the salaries of developing players, but that closer ties could alienate the CFL's remaining followers.
But fans already appear to have turned off the CFL.
Average attendance slipped to 22,095 this year from 24,400 in 1995, despite a slick new ""Radically Canadian"" marketing campaign trumpeting the league's Canadian heritage.
In major markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, the league is considered second-rate.
A 1995 pre-season NFL game between the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills in Toronto drew about 60,000 fans. This year, the Argonauts, despite the league's best record of 15-3, averaged just 20,400 fans.
Unless there is a late surge in ticket sales, the Grey Cup game will fall short of a sell-out. ""The way it looks now we may have about 36,000. We have capacity for about 40,000,"" organiser Matthew Moreland said on Friday.
It is a far cry from the 1950s and 1960s when the CFL attracted huge crowds and players such as Ron Lancaster, Joe Kapp, Angelo Mosca and Sam Etcheverry were household names.
Players now rarely stay long enough to become known by fans. Poor marketing has also left the CFL far behind other sports in the race for the public's entertainment dollars.
In a bid to save the league, Smith has proposed a restructuring plan to cut costs. All clubs have until January to secure enough season-ticket sales to operate next year.
Smith is confident there will be eight teams next year, but he said the CFL was prepared to operate with fewer.
There will likely be no football in Ottawa, next year after the league revoked the franchise in Canada's capital from Chicago businessman Horn Chen.",0
"Bank of Montreal, Canada's third biggest bank, said Tuesday annual profits soared past C$1 billion ($750 million) as it kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings reporting season for the country's largest banks.
The Toronto-based bank, which has operations in Canada, the United States and Mexico, said net income jumped 18.4 percent to C$1.17 billion ($873 million) in the year ended Oct. 31. The bank's return on equity, a key measure of profitability, rose to 17 percent from 15.4 percent last year.
""These results represent the seventh consecutive year of record earnings and the seventh consecutive year return on equity was over 14 percent,"" Chairman Matthew Barrett said in a statement.
Bank of Montreal is the third bank to break through the C$1 billion threshold in recent years, following the Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The bank attributed the record earnings to higher fees, volume growth in Canada and the United States and the impact of acquiring a 16 percent stake in Mexico's Grupo Financiero Bancomer SA de CV.
About 47 percent of the Bank of Montreal's total income came from operations outside of Canada in fiscal 1996.
Net income from its U.S. operations, where the bank owns Chicago-based Harris Bankcorp Inc., rose 6 percent to C$390 million ($291 million).
Earnings from Mexico rose 4 percent to C$57 million ($42 million). Other international businesses contributed C$102 million ($76 million) to the bank's bottom line, up 1 percent from 1995.
Speaking to reporters, Barrett said the bank should meet or exceed 10 percent growth in annual earnings per share going forward.
""There is sufficient counter cyclicality built into the range of businesses and range of geographies that we're operating in now that we continue to feel that we would be able to maintain that 10 percent EPS growth or better in the years ahead,"" Barrett said.
The bank's earnings were generally in line with estimates.
Fourth quarter earnings rose to C$1.04 (77 cents) a share from 93 cents (69 cents) in the same period in 1995.
""They were a little weaker than what I was looking for, but pretty much in line for intents and purposes,"" said Kevin Choquette, an analyst with Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.
Choquette had forecast fourth quarter earnings of C$1.06 (79 cents) a share.
Improved credit quality also contributed to the bank's strong performance. It's provision for credit losses fell to C$225 million ($168 million) in 1996 from C$275 million ($205 million) in 1995.
Barrett told reporters that the bank will plan for a credit loss provision of C$275 million in 1997.
""We'll stick with that until we are six months into the year and see how the credit cycle shakes out,"" he said.
Bank of Montreal's stock closed down C$0.45 (33 cents) to C$44.20 (33 cents) in heavy turnover of 1.5 million shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
The recent rally in Canadian bank stocks pushed Bank of Montreal's return on investment up 42.4 percent in 1996, compared to a 24-percent gain last year.
Despite today's weakness in Bank of Montreal shares, the TSE's banks and trusts index climbed 14 points to a new high of 6164.60.",0
"Profits at Canada's six big banks topped C$6 billion ($4.4 billion) in 1996, smashing last year's C$5.2 billion ($3.8 billion) record as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada wrapped up the earnings season on Thursday.
The six banks each reported a double-digit jump in net income for a combined profit of C$6.26 billion ($4.6 billion) in fiscal 1996 ended Oct. 31.
But a third straight year of record profits came amid growing public anger over perceived high service charges and credit card rates, and tight lending policies.
Bank officials defended the group's performance, saying that millions of Canadians owned bank shares through mutual funds and pension plans.
Shareholders of four of the six banks were rewarded with healthy dividend hikes this year.
""Our activities mean jobs, investment, tax revenue, dividend payments and foreign income for Canada's economy,"" CIBC chairman Al Flood said after the bank reported a 35 percent jump in net income on Thursday.
CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, said net income climbed to C$1.36 billion ($1 billion) in fiscal 1996 from C$1.01 billion ($743 million) in 1995.
CIBC also boosted its quarterly dividend by C5 cents (3.6 cents) to C50 cents (37 cents), the second increase in 1996.
Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada previously raised their payouts as well.
Royal Bank, Canada's largest bank, reported the highest corporate profit in Canadian history on Wednesday, with 1996 net income rising 13 percent to C$1.43 billion ($1.05 billion).
Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal cracked the billion-dollar barrier this year, joining CIBC and Royal Bank, which crossed the threshold in 1995 and 1994 respectively.
National Bank, the smallest of the big six, posted a 30 percent jump in net income to C$318 million ($234 million) this year.
The banks attributed their performances to lower credit losses and healthy commercial and personal banking. Investment banking, brokerage and mutual fund businesses also enjoyed a banner year as financial markets soared in 1996.
Earnings at CIBC's Wood Gundy Inc. investment arm skyrocketed 122 percent to C$528 million ($389 million) in 1996.
The group's earnings and dividend hikes were in line or slightly better than analysts' forecasts.
""It was good news and a fairly good outlook for 1997 in terms of earnings and dividends,"" said Hugh Brown, a banking analyst with investment dealer Nesbitt Burns Inc.
Brown said he now had a more positive outlook for bank earnings in 1997, saying Big Six profits may grow between 9 and 10 percent next year, up from previous growth forecasts of about 7 percent.
Bank stocks, which have led the Toronto Stock Exchange to new heights since September, fell on Thursday in tandem with the rest of the market. CIBC led the decline, dropping C$2.25 ($1.65) to C$57.25 ($42) in late trading.",0
"Canada's big six banks, which have long ruled the country's street corners with their vast branch networks, face a challenge to their dominance by the Internet and the rise of new ""virtual banks.""
Telephone and computer banking, debit cards and automated teller machines (ATMs) are rapidly transforming Canada's old-style bricks-and-mortar banking system.
New technology has eliminated the need for costly branch networks and lured offshore rivals to jump into Canada's $66.5 billion consumer banking market.
""Virtual banks have the potential to send our branch networks the way of the passenger train -- much loved, but seldom used,"" said Bank of Montreal chairman Matthew Barrett in a speech to Toronto's business community.
BIG BANKS PREPARE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE
The big banks, which dominate regular banking, trust and brokerages in Canada, are marshalling their forces against this cyber-onslaught.
Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada are spending millions of dollars to develop new distribution channels and upgrade branches.
ING Groep N.V., with nearly $260 billion in assets, is by far the biggest electronic challenger. The Dutch financial services giant dwarfs Royal Bank, the country's biggest financial institution with assets of $147 billion.
ING, already a player in Canada's insurance market, plans to offer a wide range of electronic banking services through a new subsidiary, ING Trust Co. of Canada, based in Toronto.
ING is keeping a low profile until its application for a trust licence is approved, but bank officials are confident of success where others have failed.
In recent years, several foreign banks abandoned Canada because of its restrictive banking laws and stiffer than expected competition from the big domestic banks.
""It would be fair to say that we will be competing on several fronts. It won't be hard to offer better service,"" said Jim Kelly, vice-president of marketing for ING's Canadian operations.
ING WILL DRAW ON ITS EUROPEAN EXPERIENCE
He said ING will draw on its extensive experience in electronic banking in Europe.
Analysts have said ING can use Canada to fine tune its virtual bank before offering similar services in the larger U.S. market. But Kelly said there are no plans yet to take ING's virtual bank south of the border.
""To say we're definitely going to the U.S. would be wrong. To say that we would look at it and see if there is a market opportunity, yes, of course we would,"" he said.
Also eyeing Canada's consumer banking market is Citibank Canada, a unit of U.S. giant Citicorp, which is joining with Canadian fund manager AGF Management Ltd., to create a virtual trust company.
The venture is Citibank's second foray into Canadian consumer banking after abandoning a bid to establish a traditional branch system in the 1980s.
Charles Stuart, country manager of Citibank's consumer banking operations in Canada, said the joint venture gives the bank access to AGF's customer base. Citibank plans to offer customers a full-service banking package, including credit cards, access to ATM service and telephone banking.
""We're not locked into the costs of a bricks-and-mortar structure. So we can serve them through technology and that enables us to price ourselves very competitively,"" he said.
The Citibank/AGF venture could set a pattern for other foreign banks seeking to enter Canada with an established customer base, Stuart said.
BIG BANKS UNDER PRESSURE FROM LOCAL RIVALS
The Big Six banks are pressured by local rivals as well.
Last month, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union, the country's biggest credit union with $3.6 billion in assets, applied to open a nationwide branchless bank early next year.
While cyber competitors are poised to invade the retail market, Canada's major banks are also on the move.
The banks spent a record $1.7 billion on new technology in 1995 and that is expected to reach $1.9 billion by 1998, according to a report by accounting firm Ernst & Young.
Much of the money is being poured into alternative delivery channels such as point-of-sale credit and debit cards, ATMs, telephone and computer banking.
Cards account for more than a third of all payment transactions in Canada, up from 25 percent a year ago.
Telephone and computer transactions are climbing as well. Traditional bank transactions are seen falling to 21 percent in 1998 from 38 percent last year.
Among Canadian banks, Royal Bank is the top player in telephone banking with more than 800,000 subscribers. Bank officials expect 40 percent of their eight million customers to be using alternative channels in five years.
Last month, Royal Bank joined 14 other North American banks to set up a computer banking network with computer giant IBM in early 1997.
All the banks are struggling to decide the future of their branch networks, but CIBC has taken the first steps to overhaul its 1,400 branches.
In a recent pilot project, CIBC employed greeters to guide customers to ATMs for their basic banking needs. Bank tellers were retrained to advise customers on such products as mutual funds, loans and mortgages.
Billing it as the bank branch of the future, CIBC said transaction costs had fallen dramatically, while customer lineups were much thinner.
But by using these low-cost channels, customers will expect a break on service fees, which many consumers complain are too high, Ernst & Young said.
Bank of Nova Scotia has taken the acquisition route to boost its Internet services. It recently bought a 10 percent stake in iSTAR Internet Inc., an Internet solutions firm, to help develop new channels and services for the bank.",0
"China said on Monday it expected talks with the United States soon on a dispute over U.S. sanctions on its textiles and its own threat to retaliate.
Beijing also said it was still too soon to say which U.S. imports would be banned if Washington failed to withdraw penalties on imported Chinese textiles.
""We expect to see working level talks with the U.S. in the near future,"" an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation told Reuters.
""The two sides will exchange views,"" he said.
Beijing said on Sunday it would suspend temporarily its imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods, animal husbandry products, fruits and alcoholic drinks in retaliation for Washington's imposition of punitive charges on American purchases of Chinese textiles.
The temporary import ban would take effect on December 10.
In September, Washington announced punitive charges against import quotas for Chinese textile goods, accusing China of using transshipments to avoid U.S. quota restrictions.
China said the action was taken without consultation and with no clear supporting evidence, adding it had no choice but to impose retaliatory sanctions.
""We are still seeking the views of Chinese enteprises about which products should be included under the ban,"" the Chinese official said.
""That will be determined in another 30 days.""
The total of trade affected by Washington's action was estimated at $19 million -- only a fraction of Sino-U.S. trade, which is now heavily in China's favour. The United States says its trade deficit with China last year was more than $35 billion.
But China's threatened trade ban, made ahead of a planned visit to Beijing this month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, meant yet another face-off in the frequently testy Sino-U.S. ties.
Relations have been strained over the last year by a range of issues from Taiwan to arms proliferation to trade and human rights.
China and the United States have said they saw an improvement in relations since they narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Beijing's political rival Taiwan earlier this year.
The two sides are preparing for high level exchanges next year, including a possible visit to China by U.S. Vice President Al Gore and a summit between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
Christopher's visit was expected to pave the way for these meetings.",0
"China's once strained ties with the United States have improved dramatically in recent months with a series of top level visits healing some of the old wounds.
But as the two nations move closer, the United States is sidestepping one of China's most sensitive figures -- Premier Li Peng -- who is still too closely linked to the 1989 crushing of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, diplomats said on Sunday.
They said that Li is one Chinese leader who does not fit into the agenda for a visit to Washington.
""It may be a bit unfair but he is the one leader everyone remembers for his role in the (1989) crackdown,"" said a senior foreign diplomat.
Last month U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made his first visit to China in two years, setting the stage for the series of meetings between other high ranking officials of the two countries.
During Christopher's visit, the two sides reached an understanding that their relationship should not be side-tracked by any one issue. That meant contacts would proceed despite continued disagreements over a range of issues from human rights, to trade and China's political rivalry with Taiwan.
Chinese Minister of Defence Chi Haotian is now in the United States after twice delaying a visit -- both times due to tension over Taiwan. He met President Bill Clinton on Monday last week.
Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin held talks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines last month, and an exchange of visits by the two leaders is planned over 1997 and 1998.
U.S. Vice President Al Gore is expected to visit China some time during the first half of next year.
But there is no talk yet of a return visit to the United States by Premier Li, Gore's counterpart in the Chinese government.
U.S. officials in Beijing played down the lack of an invitation, saying the timing of the Gore visit itself had not been set.
Other foreign analysts said an invitation would be made but there was little chance of a visit before a new premier takes office in 1998.
China is expected to sort out its leadership line-up at the Communist Party congress late next year and then formally install new government figures at the parliament meeting in March 1998.
""They (the Americans) seem to be waiting for the selection of the next premier,"" said another foreign diplomat.
Western leaders, including Americans, have been willing to meet Li in China. But for some of them, hosting him in their own country is another matter, diplomats said.
Li has been tarred with the decision to use military force to crush the pro-democracy protests in Beijing in 1989, though paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was the only man with sufficient clout to order in the army.
President Jiang was also elevated to his role as Communist Party chief because of his tough stance on dissent.
Li has not visited the United States, the United Kingdom or Australia since 1989. He has travelled to Germany, France and Canada since then, though he has been dogged by controversy on each trip.",0
"China's Communist leaders may be fretting about the erosion of the ailing state sector at the expense of more nimble private firms.
But for one of the nation's newest banks -- the China Minsheng Banking Corporation -- this is an opportunity.
Formally inaugurated in January, the bank is aiming to lend the bulk of its funds to China's non-state sector, a rapidly expanding area of the economy.
""We are focusing our business on the non-state sector,"" chairman Jing Shuping said in an interview. ""Many banks are not looking at this area or are unwilling to lend to it.""
Much of China's creaking state industry is losing money and unable to compete in domestic or export markets. But for now, Communist leaders are unable to shed an ideological albatross, insisting the state retain the leading role in the economy.
""The state sector will still play the dominant role but there will be a growing non-state sector,"" said Jing. ""This will be good for the economy and good for us.""
China Minsheng is a non-state entity, founded with the backing of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.
It has 59 shareholders, most federation members. Two of the biggest stakes, worth 90 million yuan ($10.8 million) each, are held by diversified Guangzhou Yitong Group and Xiamen Fuxun Group that has interests from real estate to pharmaceuticals.
The bank is relatively small by Chinese standards with total capital of 1.38 billion yuan and assets of 5 billion yuan.
Jing says it may not be profitable in its first year due to start-up costs but it aims for a 50 percent return on shareholder capital by the third year of operation.
By then, it hopes to have assets of over 10 billion yuan.
It differs from many of China's state-run banks that are unable to recover their loans -- made as policy decisions in support of struggling, government-run enterprises.
""We have no policy loans,"" said Jing.
China Minsheng has extended over 1.0 billion yuan in loans this year -- all on commercial terms.
""Most loans are for working capital and not for more than one year,"" he said. ""All have collateral or a guarantee.""
The bank's headquarters are a short walk from the Beijing city government, but Jing said officials do not stroll over to ask for special favours for hard-hit local companies.
""They go to the other banks,"" he said. ""The state banks are trying to become commercial banks but they still have to make some policy loans.""
Besides its headquarters and an office for international business, China Minsheng has three branches in Beijing. One is in the Haidian district where many high-technology, non-state companies have sprung up -- just the type of customer it wants.
The bank cannot lure deposits with higher interest rates since all deposit rates are fixed by the central bank.
Instead, it must compete in terms of service, staying open longer hours and pumping funds into improving technology by installing computer and automated teller equipment.
It has some flexibility on the interest it charges borrowers, though, with a range of 10 percent above or below levels set by the central bank.
In the future, China Minsheng will face more competition from foreign banks -- now barred from taking deposits or making loans in Chinese currency.
""At the moment, they cannot do local currency business,"" said Jing. ""But that will change.""
The bank is already looking at new areas of business, such as home mortgages, to meet expected demand as China develops a real estate market.
It may also want to tap domestic or foreign capital markets to ensure it has the financial muscle to stay competitive.
""There could be a movement in this direction in the future,"" Jing said. ""But first we need a good performance over the next three years.""

"China ushered in 1997, a year it has hailed as one of the most significant of the communist era for the impending recovery of Hong Kong, with a paean to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the man who made it all possible.
China Central Television broadcast on Wednesday the first episode of a documentary lauding the 92-year-old political patriarch, a man whose pragmatic policies turned a backward Stalinist state into an economic powerhouse and helped regain capitalist Hong Kong from Britain.
The primetime programme, to be shown over 12 days, would set the tone for a crucial Communist Party congress due later this year, largely by defining Deng's legacy to the current party leadership, Chinese and Western political analysts said.
""This is an extremely important year for the Communist Party with the recovery of Hong Kong and the holding of the 15th party congress,"" a Western diplomat said.
""China's leaders are reminding people that Deng was instrumental in regaining Hong Kong, and they are also using him to define their own policies at the congress and in the post-Deng era.""
Deng has not been seen in public in nearly three years. At his last appearance he looked frail and unsteady.
The documentary showed a vigorous leader, larger than life and portrayed against a background of golden clouds radiating across the sky.
He was seen inspecting factories while donning a hard hat, shaking hands with children and receiving gifts of poppies in Paris in the 1970s.
The main theme of the one-hour show was clearly reform, underlining China's commitment to its course of market-oriented economic change charted by Deng and continued under his chosen successor President Jiang Zemin.
But its use of adulatory tones -- opposed by Deng who abhorred the personality cult of revolutionary leader Mao Zedong -- suggested that the ageing party veteran had little or no control over the documentary's contents.
Speculation about Deng's health surfaces periodically and an unconfirmed report described him as lapsing briefly into unconsciousness this week.
Some Hong Kong newspaper reports said he had been admitted to a top military hospital but there were no unusual movements this week at the Beijing medical centre where senior officials are usually treated.
Deng had vowed to visit Hong Kong to witness the historic transfer of power at midnight on June 30 this year but a Beijing official believed to be close to the Deng family said recently this was unlikely.
On Wednesday, the People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, called on China's 1.2 billion people to uphold Deng's credo of pragmatism known as ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"".
In an article published earlier this week the newspaper described the television series on the life of the nation's paramount leader as one that ""showed in their entirety the glorious achievements and greatness of the theories of comrade Deng Xiaoping.""
The documentary had taken four years to complete and included interviews with more than 100 senior officials, according to official media.
Previews from the series showed Deng giving words of encouragement to party officials and reviewing China's military might -- interspersed with glimpses of sleek skyscrapers and modern factories, symbols of the material progress inspired by the party patriarch.
""This is very much linked to the party congress,"" said a Chinese academic. ""It is setting the tone for those taking part in the party congress.""
President and Communist Party chief Jiang narrated parts of the episode seen on television and was shown giving his assessment that Deng had made an important contribution to the building of a modern, socialist China.
Jiang is widely seen as the man who has the most to gain from the adulation for the paramount leader.
""This shows he (Jiang) has the mantle of Deng,"" said another Western diplomat.
""He is building up himself by building up Deng.""",0
"European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan suggested on Thursday that China might soon see progress on its plan to join the World Trade Organisation but Beijing played down chances of a breakthrough.
Brittan said he might press the United States to move forward on China's drive to join the WTO if Beijing would give an assurance that it supported the European position.
""I will certainly take up the matter with the Americans with extreme urgency ... urging them that the time has come to adopt the approach that Europe has pioneered,"" he told a business conference in the Chinese capital.
""I hope even before the end of this visit to be able to announce some specific action"" in advancing the process, he said.
Europe has maintained that it would be flexible on requirements for China's full implementation of WTO rules. But Beijing had to make clear its commitment to full compliance and show progress on granting access to its domestic markets.
China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi on Thursday appeared to be unconvinced that the United States, which has been a key hurdle to Beijing's drive to join the global trade organisation, was ready to change its stance.
""Their intentions are kind-hearted,"" said Wu in a reference to the European effort. ""But the question of China's accession to the World Trade Organisation is not entirely decided by the European Union,"" she told reporters at the same business conference.
Beijing has been pushing to join the WTO under the more lenient terms of developing nation status but Washington has insisted that China's economy is too big for such treatment.
Brittan, who is leading a delegation of 30 European business leaders hoping to tap into the Chinese market, said he would meet senior Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and foreign trade minister Wu.
Brittan made it clear that a reaffirmation of Chinese acceptance of the European position would be enough for him to try to take his case to the United States.
""The U.S. was erecting very high hurdles to be surmounted,"" he said of the American position.
But he said the end of the U.S. presidential election campaign could be an opportunity for making progress in the negotiations.
""Recent stirrings in the media...suggest that the U.S. is perhaps readier now than over the past two years to heed European calls for decisive engagement on this negotiation,"" Brittan said.
Brittan praised China for making strides in strengthening intellectual property rights though he said more market access was needed.
He also warned that Europe would not be discriminated against in the Chinese market, and he singled out bilateral shipping agreements as an area of concern.
""Europe cannot accept unequal treatment and will not be discriminated against,"" he said.
On Wednesday, Chinese leaders denounced Beijing's exclusion from the WTO as unjust, saying the world's largest developing nation had made great strides in opening its markets to trade and investment.
Beijing also lashed out on Thursday at European Union investigations into Chinese textile exports, hinting at retaliatory measures if the probes led to anti-dumping measures.",0
"The Stone Group, a Chinese high technology company, plans to inject assets into its Stone Electronic unit to boost trading in the Hong Kong-listed firm, a top group official said.
The asset injections could begin next year as the Hong Kong company recovers from its steep slide in profits in 1995, president Duan Yongji told Reuters.
""We want to expand our float,"" Duan said in an interview late on Tuesday.
""We don't have enough stock on the market. Many investors say 'you are not big enough',"" he said, adding that more shares would be sold once the assets were injected into the listed vehicle.
The plan requires a sharp reduction in the price-to-earnings ratio of the company's stock -- now at about 23 -- to about 10.
Duan said a sharp rise in earnings expected this year and in 1997 would help to set the stage for the plan.
The Beijing-based Stone Group Corp listed shares in 1993 with a HK$300 million ($38 million) flotation for Stone Electronic Technology Ltd.
The group still has a controlling 57 percent stake in the Hong Kong company, which makes integrated word processors and printers and distributes a wide range of products, including computers as well as office and lighting equipment.
Stone Group now has 18 joint ventures and it plans to start placing some of those assets into the listed firm.
""We are preparing to inject some of the profitable companies into that vehicle,"" Duan said.
Stone Group probably will inject a large part of its 40 percent stake in a $60 million China-based joint venture with Matsushita of Japan to produce light fixtures. The plant has required heavy start-up costs but should be profitable next year, Duan said.
Stone Group also has a stake in a $1.6 billion semiconductor project with Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsui in China, although that will not begin production until late 1997 or early 1998.
Stone, one of the success stories of China's electronics industry, was started with a loan of 20,000 yuan ($2,400) in 1984.
""We used to compete with just the little guys,"" said Duan.
""That has changed dramatically in recent years,"" he said, adding that all major multi-nationals were now in the domestic market as China has relaxed its once-tight curbs on imports.
""Technology is also changing rapidly so we have to make use of our capital,"" the executive said. ""We can't let it stand still.""
Stone Electronic's profits slumped to HK$17 million in 1995 from HK$63.88 million in 1994. But earnings for the first half of this year were up 44 percent over the year-ago period to HK$10.22 million.
""I can't give a profit figure for all of this year but the full year growth will be better than first-half growth,"" Duan said, adding that 1997 should continue that trend.
Stone sees specialised electronic products for the banking system and tax collection as areas where it has major advantages over its competitors.",0
"China is preparing a lobbying campaign to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at the ministerial meeting in Singapore this month, officials said.
It will send a team led by Long Yongtu, assistant minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and an experienced trade negotiator, to the meetings that begin next Monday, Chinese officials said.
China, which will be an observer at the meetings, has waged a lengthy battle to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its successor body governing global trade, the WTO.
It has pushed to gain entry on the favourable terms of a developing nation but Western countries, particularly the United States, have insisted its economy was too big for such preferential treatment.
""We will be there as an observer,"" said a Chinese trade official of the Singapore meeting. ""That is all we will be doing.""
BEIJING TO PRESS CASE
But foreign diplomats said China would continue to press its case, mainly outside the official meetings in bilateral talks with member countries.
""The real work will be in the corridors around the meeting,"" said a diplomat who monitors international trade issues.
""China wants support from as many countries as possible to put pressure on the United States,"" said another diplomat.
China views gaining entry to the WTO as a symbol of its growing prestige but it also is eyeing the benefits of fixed mechanisms for settling trade disputes.
Beijing has had numerous trade spats with its major trading partners -- from annual review by the United States of its Most Favoured Nation status to copyright protection for textiles and shoes.
By joining the global trade body, China could ensure that any penalties imposed on it conformed with WTO dispute settlement procedures. Diplomats said that could be of considerable value to Beijing as mounting exports increase the prospect of trade disputes.
Western diplomats familiar with the trade issue described China's current position on WTO as ""woefully inadequate"".
MOVING TOWARD COMPROMISE
But diplomats said Beijing was aware that it must put more on the table and there appeared to be some movement toward a compromise.
China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last month at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines that China expected to conclude talks with the United States on WTO in the first half of next year.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has also offered to aim for an average 15 percent import duty by the year 2000 compared with 23 percent now.
More important to the United States is ensuring access to the big Chinese domestic market and the removal of a whole range of practices that are seen as discriminating against foreign firms.
Washington would like to see an end to unpublished restrictions on purchases of foreign made goods, changes in agricultural import practices and more relaxed requirements on producing components in China.
China says these restrictions are needed to protect infant domestic industries that are unable to compete with established foreign companies.",0
"China gave new hints on Monday that its three-year austerity programme was over, pronouncing its anti-inflation fight a success and saying the new task was ensuring stability as the nation prepared to recover Hong Kong.
China's top leaders, after winding up four days of meetings on the economy, also said a key goal next year was to speed reform of ailing state enterprises.
""After three years of strenuous efforts, our national economy has had sustained, rapid and healthy development. The main task of keeping inflation under control has been achieved,"" the official Economic Daily said in its report on the meeting.
""Next year is an important one in our history as it marks the recovery of Hong Kong and the year of the 15th Communist Party congress,"" the official People's Daily said in a commentary that also called for economic progress in the midst of stability.
China slapped tight controls on government spending in 1993 to keep mounting inflation in check.
The credit curbs are likely to bring inflation below 6.5 percent this year, compared with 14.8 percent last year and a Communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
The fall in inflation has allowed China to cut interest rates twice this year.
Many economists have been expecting a further easing of monetary policies in the coming months as China is expecting a smooth handover of Hong Kong and social stability ahead of the key policy meeting of the Communist Party.
The British colony reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997 and political planners in Beijing have been eager to ensure that there are no social or economic dislocations in the territory or on the China mainland to mar the transfer of power.
The party congress, scheduled for the second half of next year, is widely expected to result in an infusion of cash into the economy to bolster the standing of the current leadership as party personnel matters come up for discussion.
Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson recently forecast credit expansion of 20 to 25 percent next year, compared with 17 percent this year.
""Naturally there will be some easing (of monetary policy) next year,"" said Cheng Xiusheng, an economist with the Development Research Centre under the State Council, or cabinet.
He added that the monetary easing would be limited, and would not trigger a new round of inflation.
""The focus is relatively quick economic development under the premise of stability,"" he said.
Other economists agreed there would not be a return to higher inflation.
""If we have an adjustment, it will be a small one,"" said Zhang Zhuoyuan, director of the economics institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
He added that reform of state-owned enterprises was still the key problem facing China's economic planners.
State-owned enterprises have been losing money and massive subsidies have been draining state resources.
Political leaders fear that cutting off these subsidies would lead to layoffs and social unrest though economists have said the strength of the economy gives planners a chance to tackle this problem now.",0
"A Chinese appeals court, in a rare move, sharply reduced on Friday to five years a prison sentence for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) employee accused of corruption.
The court's decision followed a brief suspension of technical assistance by the IMF and a Beijing visit by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus to voice concern over what he described as judicial shortcomings in the case.
The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court sentenced Hong Yang, 44, a Chinese national, to five years in prison for accepting bribes totalling 100,000 yuan ($12,000) in 1993, before he joined the IMF, the Xinhua news agency said.
""The sentence was dealt with leniently... and according to law,"" Xinhua quoting the court as saying on Friday.
Hong, a former employee of the People's Bank of China, or central bank, was arrested in December while on an IMF mission to China. He was found guilty on June 28.
Beijing sources said the original sentence was for 10 years, although statements by the IMF in Washington put it at 11 years. Hong appealed.
Chinese courts rarely cut sentences on appeal, though an admission of guilt may lead to more lenient treatment.
Camdessus has confirmed reports that Chinese authorities pressured the IMF to include Hong, who had been working at the international organisation's headquarters in Washington, on a mission to China.
The Chinese actions created a furore at the IMF and Camdessus said in a letter to the organisation's staff he would closely monitor a second trial.
""I also urged that the second open trial be transparent and complete and remedy the shortcomings of the first trial,"" Camdessus said after he visited Beijing last month.
Xinhua did not mention the original trial but it highlighted the legality and openness of the second.
It said the case was put on open trial on August 9 and that Hong, his two defence lawyers and four witnesses appeared in court and were involved in the proceedings.
It also said that 200 people, including Hong's relatives and IMF officials, were present.
It added that the man accused of offering the bribe, Fan Honggen, and other individuals from the Agricultural Bank would be dealt with in a separate case. It did not give further details.",0
"China has tightened safety measures after a fatal rocket explosion early this year and has found the cause of another launch failure in August, Chinese space officials said on Wednesday.
Further testing was needed for the Long March 3 rocket and that could delay China's launch schedule, they said.
""Launch vehicles will now self-destruct if there is a failure,"" said Zhang Qingwei, vice president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
""We will also ensure that people (living in the area of space centres) will be moved away when we conduct a launch,"" he told an international conference on space technology.
A Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after launch in February, killing six people and injuring 57, according to official reports.
Unofficial sources have put the casualty toll much higher.
China's commercial space drive suffered another setback in August when a communications satellite failed to reach proper orbit after launch aboard a Long March 3 rocket.
""We have determined the cause of the August 18 failure and have taken corrective measures,"" said Zhang, adding that the problem stemmed from a faulty hydrogen valve on the third stage of the booster rocket.
""We are still conducting ground testing,"" he said. ""There will be delays (in the Long March 3) programme this year but this will not affect other Long March vehicles.""
An official of the China Aerospace Corporation, which oversees commercial satellite launches, said a Long March 3 rocket could be launched by the end of the year or early next year.
Two other launches using the Long March 2D and Long March 3A rockets were also expected to be made by the end of the year.
In January 1995, a Long March rocket blew up, killing six people and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
China once enjoyed a reputation of being a cheap and reliable provider of satellite launch services but the string of failures has shaken its hopes of playing a bigger role in the commercial space business.",0
"China on Thursday tried to play down friction with the United States over a rising trade gap and called on the U.S. to end curbs on technology exports to put trade back in balance.
""The two sides should avoid taking actions that do not help the expansion of trade,"" said a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
""These are two of the biggest markets in the world,"" he said. ""They should be complementary.""
The United States said on Wednesday its trade deficit with China climbed to nearly $29 billion in the first nine months of the year, from $25 billion in the same period last year.
The trade gap, already the second largest for the U.S. after its deficit with Japan, was seen reaching $40 billion by the end of the year, up from $34 billion in 1995.
American economists said the mounting deficit was likely to create new frictions between the two countries.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor said the growth in the deficit with China had slowed, but he called on Beijing to live up to its international trade obligations.
A group of influential U.S. senators, in a letter to President Bill Clinton, questioned Beijing's trade practices and said China should not be allowed to join the World Trade Organisation on special terms because it would harm American economic interests.
Beijing has been seeking to join the global trade body on favourable terms given to developing nations, but Washington has insisted that China's economy was too big for this treatment.
The Chinese Trade Ministry spokesman said Washington's policy curbs on U.S. exports were part of the bilateral trade problem. ""There are policy rulings that are holding back U.S. exports,"" he said. ""Where there are limits on technology exports, this is a lost export opportunity for the United States.""
The U.S. appeared to be moving to address this matter.
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Washington was considering allowing technical cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear technology despite concerns about safeguards over re-exports.
Christopher, after meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing, said the U.S. was looking at taking steps that eventually could allow American companies to sell their technology to China.
A Chinese economist suggested some of the criticism over trade was unfairly directed at China as U.S. imports were mainly labour intensive products that were not manufactured in the United States.
""If the U.S. does not buy these products from China it will buy them elsewhere,"" said Wang Jian, an economist with the State Planning Commission. ""These are goods produced by developing countries.""
But the economist conceded that bilateral trade problems could spill over into broader trade issues.
""The U.S. already is the main obstacle to China's plan to join the World Trade Organisation,"" he said, adding that renewed Sino-U.S. trade friction could further complicate the issue.",0
"A top Chinese defence official has stepped down in a reshuffle linked to China's string of satellite failures, political sources said on Friday.
General Ding Henggao has been replaced as Minister of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (COSTIND), a key body charged with overseeing high technology projects related to defence.
Ding, 65, was succeeded at the helm of the ministerial level COSTIND by 61-year-old Cao Gangchuan, a lieutenant-general and deputy chief of general staff of the People's Liberation Army.
""I can confirm that (Ding) stepped down and the change was made in late November or early December,"" said an official of the Defence Ministry.
""I do not know the reason,"" he said.
Sources with close ties to the defence industry told Reuters that Ding had been at the centre of controversy, largely over satellite issues.
""This is partly a matter of age and partly a dispute over satellites,"" said a source.
China successfully launched a satellite in October but that followed a series of failures, the most recent of them last August when a Long March 3 rocket put a U.S.-built satellite into the wrong orbit.
Last February, a Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after liftoff, killing at least six people and injuring 57 on the ground.
In January 1995, a Long March 2E blew up, killing a family of six on the ground and destroying the Apstar 2 satellite it was carrying.
""There have been bitter disputes over where the responsibility for the failures lies,"" said a source.
COSTIND is responsible for launches while China Aerospace Corporation is in charge of rockets and satellites.
The Soviet-trained Ding, who has a background in missiles and precision engineering, coordinated research and production of strategic missiles as well as satellite launches, according to an official biography.
Ding's departure probably coincided with a reshuffle that replaced the nation's air force and naval commanders, both of whom were also 65 years old.
Ding is the son-in-law of the late Marshal Nie Rongzhen, one of the veteran military leaders of China's communist revolution.
Nie Li, Ding's wife and daughter of Marshal Nie, stepped down from a senior post at COSTIND two years ago.",0
"Officials with Volkswagen-First Automotive Works in northeastern China on Monday dismissed a report that the joint venture faced possible closure.
""This report is incorrect,"" said a spokeswoman of the joint venture, referring to a report by the German news magazine Der Spiegel.
""Production is still continuing,"" she said in a telephone interview from Changchun.
""We have a 25-year agreement. If the German side withdrew unilaterally, they would have to pay compensation,"" she said. She added that the two sides would soon hold a ceremony marking the full implementation of the joint venture project.
A spokesman for Volkswagen AG's Volkswagen Asia-Pacific arm in Hong Kong also said production at the joint venture would continue.
""There is no reason to leave Changchun,"" he said.
Der Spiegel said the Changchun plant was losing money and production of the Jetta car had practically ceased.
The Hong Kong-based official said the factory had produced 14,700 Jetta cars in the first eight months of this year, up 10 percent from a year ago.
The Jetta was not selling as well as the Volkswagen Santana produced at Volkswagen's Shanghai joint venture, but that operation had taken the lion's share of the domestic passenger car market, he said.
However, some changes in the joint venture agreement were being negotiated, including the introduction of new car models as well as the possibility of Volkswagen taking over sales and after-sales service, the official added.
First Automotive Works had been producing Audi 100s at its own production line in Changchun under a seven-year licensing agreement that expired in June. The Audi 200 was now being built at the joint venture, and 400 have been produced since June.
A total of 7,445 Audi 100s were built from January to June this year, the Volkswagen official said.
First Automotive has also sold 4,120 of its Red Flag cars, an Audi-based car that the Chinese company produces separately from the joint venture using a Chrysler Corp engine, according to Volkswagen.",0
"China Tuesday announced a ban on poultry and poultry products from Missouri and Oklahoma, citing what it said was the outbreak of a deadly disease.
The ban, which took effect Monday, was aimed at preventing damage from the ""very destructive"" Newcastle disease, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture told Reuters.
Official news reports said the ban was slapped on poultry products from the two states because of five cases of the disease discovered between July and September.
The disease, known as viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, or VVND, is deadly.
However, Phillip Holloway, representative in Hong Kong and China for the Oklahoma state agriculture department, said he had not heard of any recent cases of VVND in Oklahoma.
""It's a very, very dangerous disease -- the most feared of poultry diseases,"" he said. ""The symptoms are like influenza, and once one bird gets the disease, all the poultry will die.""
The poultry industries of Oklahoma and Missouri were far down on the list of top U.S. producers and exporters, Holloway said. ""My estimate is that Oklahoma and Missouri account for less than 5 percent of U.S. poultry exports to China.""
Arkansas is the country's biggest poultry producer and home of industry giant Tyson Foods Inc.
A source at Tyson's Hong Kong office said VVND was known to exist in China, but this could not be confirmed.
Beijing has also banned all U.S. poultry brought into the country either by mail or hand-carried by travelers, according to the Ministry of Agriculture official.
The last major outbreak of VVND in the United States occurred in California in the 1970s and led to the eradication of the state's entire poultry population, Holloway said.
The United States exports around $500 million of poultry and poultry products a year to China, its biggest market after Russia.
The Chinese quarantine official told Reuters that the action was unrelated to other trade disputes with the United States and there were no plans to delay implementation of the decision.
Beijing and Washington are at odds over textile imports, and that dispute has threatened to spill over into the farm sector. China had threatened to ban some U.S. farm goods -- as well as textiles and alcoholic drinks -- in retaliation for U.S. penalties on textiles purchased from China.
On Sunday, Beijing announced it was delaying for one month implementation of those curbs, which had been scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, because the two sides were planning to hold further talks on the issue.
In October, China announced a ban on imports of poultry from 10 U.S. states because of fears it carried a virus called highly pathogenic avian influenza. China and the United States held talks on the issue and the ban did not go into effect.",0
"Two years ago, China's second telephone network set out to challenge the powerful Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and bring competition into the country's a fast-growing market.
But the fledgling network has found it hard to tackle a seasoned competitor -- one that is also the market regulator.
""Are they (the MPT) supposed to be the referee or one of the athletes on the playing field?"" asks Li Huifen, president of China United Telecommunications Corp, also known as Unicom.
The arrival of Unicom and the end of the MPT monopoly was initially hailed as a boost for China's long-suffering telephone subscribers, who often had to wait up to a year for a telephone line and endure indifferent service afterwards.
But Unicom has captured only a tiny slice of the market as its entrenched competitor has kept a tight grip on the telecommunications sector, using its regulatory clout to slow the upstart network's advance.
""They have delayed interconnections and won't give us telephone numbers for our customers,"" Li said in an interview. ""We need a telecommunications law to give us a legal framework.""
Unicom has 16 shareholders, but the key backers of the project were the ministries of electronics industry (MEI), power and railways.
MANUFACTURING MUSCLE
The MEI has manufacturing muscle with a corps of factories producing telecommunications equipment. But it feared the MPT's equipment-making capacity would eventually squeeze it out of the market unless it had its own captive customers.
The other key partners had private telecommunications networks with spare capacity, while the MPT's public network was heavily overcrowded.
The feud between the rival Chinese government camps was often bitter, sometimes ensnaring foreign companies. Firms that did business with the new network were threatened with blacklisting by the MPT, according to Western industry sources.
Those frictions have eased somewhat in recent months, but it still took an order from the State Council, or cabinet, for promised network interconnections to emerge.
China expects to have more than 60 million telephone lines installed by the end of this year -- adding a breathtaking 10 million in 1996 alone. The total is likely to top 100 million by the turn of the century, still only a small segment of the nation's 1.2 billion people.
MPT says it should not be considered a competitor to Unicom because it has a separate operating arm called China Telecom.
""Since 1993, we have separated policy making from business operations by creating China Telecom,"" said an MPT spokesman. ""The MPT is not both regulating and competing,"" he said, blaming Unicom's slow progress on its own technical problems.
STRUGGLE TO BE IMPARTIAL
But China Telecom officials concede it is hard to say where one entity ends and the other begins. And even if they can draw the line cleanly, the MPT must struggle to remain impartial.
""They always say they are being fair,"" said Unicom's Li. ""But China Telecom is their own child, and parents are always partial to their own children.""
Li took up the Unicom reins in August, becoming the third president in the company's brief history. She was tapped from her job as deputy mayor of the big industrial city of Tianjin to put political clout behind the second network.
The company started with mobile telephone services, first in the big cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, and eventually expanded to 16 cities. It has made its greatest inroads in Shanghai where it has about 20,000 mobile phone customers, Li said.
""In 10 years we will have 10 percent of the fixed line market and 30 percent of the mobile phone market,"" Li said.
One clear success has been in bringing mobile telephone prices down. They now cost 7,000 to 10,000 yuan ($840 - $1,200) compared with 10,000 to 20,000 yuan before Unicom came along.
Li says Unicom is profitable on its operations, but that excludes heavy investments in building network infrastructure. Despite the cost of putting a network in place, Unicom has one advantage. Foreigners are not permitted to operate telecommunications networks in China, and many foreign firms give Unicom capital in return for a share of the income.
That will at least ease the growing pains for the infant network, analysts said.",0
"China's central bank chief has said that inflation would be a modest seven percent this year and this showed the state's economic policies were working.
But Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, lashed out at companies that had taken advantage of tight money policies used to tackle inflation by lending money at excessively high rates.
""The appropriately tight monetary polices have achieved clear results which have been acknowledged both in China and abroad,"" Dai was quoted as saying in the Financial News on Monday.
""We can now control inflation to about seven percent for the full year,"" he said.
China's retail inflation stood at 6.9 percent year-on-year in the first seven months and at 5.9 percent in July alone.
Beijing has said it wanted to keep inflation within 10 percent for 1996, down from 14.8 percent last year and a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994.
But the central bank chief had harsh words for companies that had taken advantage of the tough austerity programme put in place three years ago to deal with the worst days of inflation.
He did not name any of the offenders but he said that some ""monopoly groups"" and publicly listed companies were lending out money at excessively high rates.
Tsingtao Brewery, which has stock listed in Hong Kong as well as in Shanghai, has run afoul of regulatory authorities in the British colony in the past for lending out funds raised from its public offer.
A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named said several big ministries were cash-rich and able to earn more than bank deposit rates by lending out their funds.
""The big offenders are some cash-rich ministries,"" said the economist. ""They can earn 16-18 percent on their money.""
That would compare with interest of 7.47 percent earned on one-year bank deposits.
Other economists have said that higher rates were available for even more speculative lending.
Dai gave no indication of whether any measures were being planned to address these problems, although he said that funds in the banking system were unevenly distributed.
He said that China had already taken steps to curb illegal money market trade and that it had taken steps to ensure that other unauthorised financial organisations did not act as commercial banks.
""There are many violations of financial regulations,"" Dai was quoted as saying. ""There must be an expansion of supervision over the financial sector.""",0
"China has taken its cue from U.S. Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan and tried to talk its raging stock markets lower but some investors said Beijing regulators did not need to shout.
China's official People's Daily ran a front-page commentary on Monday calling on investors to behave rationally in investing in the market, warning that what goes up must come down.
The commentary, carried prominently in major financial newspapers as well, also reminded the investing public that the safest place to put its money was in the bank.
Many Chinese officials and stock market brokers noted similarities to Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's now famous remarks this month about ""irrational exuberance"" of U.S. markets.
Greenspan's remarks, which did not specifically mention stocks, were clear enough to send share markets around the globe into a steep, if brief, fall. Since then many investors have remained cautious.
""There were definite similarities in approach,"" said a stock market policy official who declined to be identified.
""They (regulators) are looking at the same objectives -- the stock markets were too high and they hoped the markets would move lower,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission chuckled over the suggestion that Greenspan might have inspired Beijing's action.
""Our objective was to bring some stability to the market,"" she said without elaborating.
Whatever the objective, many brokers and investors were not entirely sympathetic with the result.
""The phrasing (of the commentary) was much too tough,"" said an angry broker in Shenzhen, home of one of the nation's two officially approved stock markets.
""This was over the top,"" he said.
The commentary called up images of Wall Street's 1929 crash while it lashed out at big investors for manipulating the market and blamed brokers for improperly extending overdrafts to finance stock purchases.
The state media also came under criticism for helping to pump up the market by urging investors to buy shares.
Last week, the bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen in southern China slapped curbs on share movements, limiting them to a daily 10 percent in either direction.
Shenzhen's A share market for domestic investors fell the 10 percent limit on Monday, sliding 46.34 points to 417.2 while Shanghai's A share market lost 9.92 percent, or 115.37 points, to 1,047.68.
The B share indices, which track shares supposedly reserved for foreign investors, closely mirrored the A share falls.
Both Shenzhen and Shanghai had seen huge run-ups in share prices this year, with most of the gains made in recent months. Shenzhen had surged 360 percent from a trough to the peak this month, while Shanghai had climbed about 150 percent.
Some brokers were sympathetic to the plight of regulators.
""The market was clearly very speculative,"" said a Beijing-based broker. ""I disagree with some people over how far ahead of itself the market actually was but there was bound to be a considerable pyschological impact from any action by the regulators.""
Brokers said that part of the reason behind the steep rise was the lack of alternative investments.
Two interest rate cuts this year had played a key role in luring money into the stock market.",0
"Heavy losses in metals trading by a young employee at big Chinese conglomerate CITIC showed striking similarities to Nick Leeson's deals that humbled Barings Bank, a top CITIC official said.
CITIC -- the China International Trust and Investment Corp -- had learned a bitter lesson from the 1994 losses and had stepped up its internal controls, group executive director Chang Zhenming said in an interview.
""There were a lot of similarities,"" Chang said of the CITIC and Barings episodes.
""We realised the seriousness of risk,"" he said.
CITIC has gained a reputation of being one of China's best run companies, expanding its operations to power, telecommunications, banking and real estate. It is probably best known for its Hong Kong-listed unit, CITIC Pacific.
Its big losses in 1994 were all the more surprising to many foreign businessmen.
The key figure in CITIC's trading was Chen Tongsheng, in his early 30's, who worked at the CITIC Shanghai office.
Like Leeson, who was 28 when his big losses on Singapore's SIMEX exchange emerged, Chen was not a university graduate.
He had worked his way through to his trading position, taking a post as a bank clerk after finishing high school.
Also like Leeson, he is now in jail -- along with his supervisor, the former president of the Shanghai operation.
""Not only was the background of the trader similar (to Leeson) but so were the trading methods as well.""
Chang said that losses stemmed from unauthorised trades on the London Metals Exchange, and that broker credits compounded the problem.
""He didn't have any money. He used LME broker credits,"" said Chang of the Shanghai trader.
Asked if special accounts were used to hide losses -- as in the Barings case - Chang said: ""You could say it was exactly the same.""
Auditors were also unable to make sense of the trading accounts, he added.
But unlike Barings, CITIC managed to survive the losses, which were about $40 million compared to Leeson's, which neared $1.4 billion.
Chang said the losses still nearly bankrupted the CITIC Shanghai operations.
""We have stepped up our internal controls,"" he said, adding that other prominent cases - such as Sumitomo's copper trading losses -- had been instructive in reducing future risk.
CITIC's subsidiaries are no longer allowed to conduct operations unrelated to their core activities.
CITIC has also stopped all commodities trading on foreign markets, in line with a central government directive.
Asked if the company might return to the market, Chang said this was unlikely in the near future.",0
"China is planning to issue rules to speed development of its key power sector with an expanded role for foreign companies, a Chinese planning official said on Tuesday.
Beijing was reviewing rules governing build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, which so far have been off limits for foreign companies on major power projects, said Wang Hong of the State Planning Commission.
""The State Council (cabinet) is considering temporary regulations,"" said Wang, director of the commission's department of foreign finance utilisation.
China has said it needs $20 billion in foreign capital through the year 2000 to meet its targets for power industry development.
Wang said the BOT rules would not be ready in time for the award of the nation's first such power sector project which is expected soon and could cost $600 million to $700 million.
China is now evaluating tenders for the Laibin power project in Guangxi province in southern China, which calls for construction and operation of two 350-megawatt power units.
Beijing says it is using the BOT method on a trial basis.
The winner could be announced within the next month, Wang told Reuters at an energy conference.
Major bidders include industrial giant ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG of Switzerland and a group including Germany's Siemens AG and Hong Kong's China Light & Power Co Ltd.
The winner would construct and operate the plant for a period of time before turning the plant over to China. Its bid would include a plan for domestic electric power rates.
The rules under review would define BOT projects and state when they are acceptable.
They would also specify the approval process, require the use of international tenders and determine the apportioning of risk between China and foreign companies, Wang said.
China generally does not allow foreign entities to hold than a 30 percent stake in key power projects, which are those with a capacity of about 250 megawatts.
Western bankers at the conference said the lack of a clear legal framework for BOT projects coupled with problems in setting domestic electric power rates made it difficult for foreign commercial banks to finance the Laibin project.",0
"China plans to develop bigger rockets to carry heavier payloads into space and expand its role in the commercial satellite market, Chinese aerospace officials said on Thursday.
The ambitious, long-term goal was to build rockets that could carry 20-tonne payloads -- more than twice the current capacity of the nation's most powerful launch vehicles, they said.
""This is a long-term goal that could stretch into the second decade of the next century,"" said a spokeswoman for China Aerospace Corp, which coordinates China's satellite launch business.
""China needs rockets to put multiple satellites into orbit -- both for its own domestic use and to help its position in the commercial space market,"" she told Reuters.
China's existing rockets have the capacity to carry payloads of 9.2 tonnes for lower earth orbits and 3.4-5.0 tonnes for geosynchronous orbits.
It has already launched multiple satellites on a single launch but officials say more development is needed.
""We will begin a development programme as soon as possible to lay a firm foundation for the new development of Chinese launch vehicle technology in the 21st century,"" said Li Jianzhong, president of the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.
""We will develop technologies, especially some key technologies for a heavy lift launch vehicle with a payload of 20 tonnes,"" he said in a paper delivered at an international conference on space technology.
He also said China would continue to study reusable space transport systems such as the U.S. space shuttle and manned flights -- although officials said these plans were unlikely to be taken into the development stage anytime soon.
China, which put its first satellite in orbit in 1970, has been trying to expand its role in the commercial space market, despite a series of recent setbacks.
A Chinese Long March 3 rocket, considered one of the nation's more reliable launch vehicles, failed to put a U.S.-built satellite into proper orbit in August.
""It was due to a tiny problem with a valve leakage,"" a scientist who worked on the rocket told Reuters.
""But that small error meant the whole launch was a failure.""
In February, technical flaws had even more disastrous results when a Long March 3B rocket exploded shortly after lift-off, killing at least six people and injuring 57.
China says it still has a high success rate for its satellite launches but the latest setbacks have tarnished its reputation.
Beijing also sees a need to step up its satellite production technology.
""We are behind the West in rocket technology but we are even farther behind in satellites,"" said the China Aerospace spokeswoman. ""We need to be able to build more sophisticated satellites with more transponders.""
The development plans will require a lot of funding, and although senior Communist Party officials are backing the space campaign, there are plenty of other government projects that demand a share of the budget.
Chinese officials declined to say how much money would be committed to the rocket development project or the space sector overall.
""I can say that our space budget is merely a fraction of what the United States spends on its space programme,"" said a senior aerospace official.",0
"Parcels giant DHL Worldwide Express, which has had its foot through the door of Eastern and Central Europe since the mid-1980s, was braced to break even on growing regional business by 2000, a senior executive said.
""I would say that certainly by the year 2000 we would be in a breakeven position as a region in its own right,"" said Peter Davies, regional director of the European rim, during an interview with Reuters on Monday.
Turnover generated from DHL's business in Eastern and Central Europe, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), would total US$155 million in 1996 compared with US$110 million in 1995, and hit US$200 million in 1997.
The breakeven comes after years of losses from the late 1980s when the region plunged into massive changes with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the break up of the former Soviet Union.
Davies, responsible for Eastern and Central Europe including the CIS, said DHL was well aware of short-term difficulties but had maintained operations in the region with its sights set on the long term.
""If you go into the market to make a fast buck, then you are in there for the wrong reason...you have to have a long term view to that,"" Davies said.
""DHL doesn't make a profit as such, but it's okay, we know that. We have a long-term investment plan,"" he said.
But staying power of the company, which employs some 3,500 people in the region, might just be starting to pay off having captured 75 percent of market share there.
Growing foreign investments by its clients in the more mature economies of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as well as the CIS have meant more business, Davies said.
And in places like the former Yugoslavia where basic infrastructure and services were not well in place, delivery services were seen as particularly critical, he said.
The company has invested some US$46 million through expanding facilities and aircraft purchases in 1996 for Eastern and Central Europe and topped off another seven percent of the amount in training.
It now operates in 165 locations in the region and would add another 35 stations in 1997, Davies said.
""We have invested much, especially in the countryside and the next stage would be expansion of facilities,"" he said.",0
"The president of Chinese state oil refiner Sinopec said on Thursday the country planned to increase refining capacity and ethylene production to help keep up with rapid economic growth and fast rising energy demand.
""Within the ninth five-year plan (1996-2000), we will boost our economic system and growth...According to the government, we have been designated a pillar industry in the country,"" said Sheng Huaren, president of China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec).
Sheng was speaking at the beginning of a five-day exhibition in Hong Kong featuring more than 60 Sinopec subsidiaries, amongst them refiners, petrochemical plants, engineering companies and trade and investment arms.
Sheng outlined Sinopec's expansion plans in two phases.
By 2000, the company will have increased its refining capacity to over 200 million tonnes per year (4.0 million barrels per day  bpd ) while its ethylene production capacity would hit around five million tonnes per year.
By 2010, refining capacity will hit 300 to 350 million tonnes per year (up to 7.0 million bpd) while ethylene production would reach 8.0 to 10 million tonnes, Sheng said.
Sinopec's crude refining capacity is currently 166 million tonnes per year, with ethylene output at 2.36 million tonnes per year.
Fast economic growth is forecast to raise China's oil demand. Experts say refined oil product consumption will rise to 4.2 million bpd in 2000 and 6.8 million bpd in 2010 from 3.07 million bpd in 1995.
The world's sixth largest oil producer, China became a net oil importer in 1993 when brisk economic development outpaced domestic oil output, which is burdened by ageing oilfields and a lack of new discoveries.
While attempts are being made to locate new fields, Beijing has also given a clear mandate for refineries, particularly those along the coast and in big cities, to expand their capacities and upgrade to produce cleaner, more environmentally friendly products.
There are also indications that primary oil refining expansion will be accompanied by upgrading secondary petrochemical plants.
""The code is now ""oil and chemical'. Based on experiences of the oil industry elsewhere, such an approach is more realistic, comprehensive,"" said a senior official with the Fujian refinery, in the southeastern province of Fujian.
China's biggest refinery, Yanshan in Beijing, plans to increase its 9.5 million tonnes per year capacity to 10 million tonnes before 2000, a senior official told Reuters.
Ethylene production, which has been expanded from 300,000 tonnes per year to 450,000 tonnes per year since September 1994, will be increased to 600,000 tonnes during the same period, she said.
In Fujian, the 2.5 million tonnes per year refinery will be expanded to 4.0 million tonnes by 1997. Talks are also underway with foreign investors to expand capacity further to 8.0 million tonnes per year and build an ethylene plant of 600,000 tonnes capacity, a Fujian official said.
Fierce bidders for the 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) joint venture plan are Amoco Corp and Exxon Corp.
Yangzi refinery in Nanjing in Jiangsu province plans to raise capacity to 8.0 million tonnes from 5.5 million tonnes per year, a senior refinery official said.
It signed a letter of intent with BASF AG in March to build an integrated petrochemical site. The 50-50 joint venture, worth 50 billion yuan ($6 billion), has 16 plants, one of which is a 600,000 tonnes per year ethylene facility.

"Shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa made his first appearance in China as Hong Kong's leader-in-waiting on Thursday as Beijing prepared the next milestone in the British colony's transition to Chinese rule.
In a one-day meeting on Thursday in Shenzhen, just over the border from Hong Kong, Tung was endorsed as successor to colonial governor Chris Patten by the 150-member Beijing-picked Preparatory Committee, which is crafting the territory's political future.
Britain hands Hong Kong back to China on July 1.
Tung, 59, was selected as the post-handover leader in Hong Kong on Wednesday by a separate 400-member body carefully assembled by Beijing, smothering his two rivals by winning 80 percent of the votes.
At the Preparatory Committee meeting in Shenzhen, presided over by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Tung was greeted with hearty applause, smiles and back-patting as he entered the hall.
""We have already completed the selection of the first Chief Executive of Hong Kong... Tung Chee-hwa received the majority vote of 320,"" said senior Chinese envoy Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.
Preparatory Committee Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin urged delegates to show their support for China's endorsement of Tung.
""If you don't have any objection, then approve it by applauding,"" Wang said, prompting the delegates, who include some of Hong Kong's top business leaders, to begin clapping.
In a meeting with reporters later, Tung reiterated his hope that Anson Chan, Hong Kong's popular chief secretary and head of the civil service, would stay on as his deputy.
""I haven't decided on my deputy, I hope Anson Chan will stay and I hope she can be my deputy,"" Tung said.
Tung said he would also work closely with the current British-led government to promote Hong Kong in the final months of colonial rule and ensure a smooth transition.
Tung's selection was met with scuffles, anger and apathy on Wednesday in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy activists and politicans denounced the selection process as undemocratic and condemned the magnate's appointment.
In addition to endorsing Tung's appointment on behalf of the Beijing government, Thursday's Preparatory Committee meeting in Shenzhen will also discuss a package of procedures for establishing a provisional legislature on December 21 that will replace Hong Kong's elected chamber with the handover.
The legislature plan has been strongly opposed by Hong Kong pro-democracy groups, which see it as a move to crush freedom and introduce repressive laws.
An official said the gathering was also expected to discuss a move by Britain to introduce a lenient anti-subversion law in Hong Kong before the handover. A Preparatory Committee legal sub-group has recommended repealing the British law.
Tung has said he would take a hard line against meddling by provincial Chinese bosses who may disregard Beijing's edict that Hong Kong be a Special Administrative Region of China with considerable autonomy in governing its own affairs.
Hong Kong's Economic Times newspaper said China was expected to rank the future chief executive as equal to a state councillor.
This position, one level below vice-premier, would mean he outranks provincial governors and will help discourage interference in Hong Kong affairs by regional cadres, it said.",0
"Commercial sponsors have flocked to the Portuguese enclave of  Macau to back Sunday's annual Grand Prix despite fears that China wants to steal the show.
Fans of Asia's answer to Monte Carlo fear a Formula One track, recently constructed just across the border in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, will seduce sponsors and signal the death knell for Macau's Formula Three race.
Macau has no special track with the race run through the enclave's twisting streets.
But the concerns have not materialised this year at least and Macau is festooned with banners, kiosks and giveaways from sponsors including French oil concern Elf, Budweiser and Corona beer, watchmaker Omega and Japanese tyre manufacturer Yokohama.
""Zhuhai hasn't really affected Macau because most of its sponsors are here for very specific reasons,"" said Stephanie de Kantzow, an organiser of the Macau Formula Three Grand Prix.
The annual event, about 60 kilometres west-southwest of Hong Kong, started in 1954 and many of the world's top drivers have cut their teeth on the tricky 6.2 km (3.8 miles) Guia street circuit. Double Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher, and current Formula One champion Damon Hill are past Macau competitors.
China also insists it is not seeking to edge Macau out of hosting international motor racing.
""We won't affect Macau. Macau's speciality is in the Formula Three, our aim is to host Formual One and the GT (Global Touring) Rally,"" Yu Binglin, vice-mayor of Zhuhai, said in a recent interview.
Elf, one of the event's major sponsors, said there was no reason for it to pull out of Macau even though another race track has sprung up in China.
""Macau has a history of automobile racing. As long as Formula Three Grand Prix exists in Macau, Elf will be present in Macau. Business and selling products is one thing, sport is another,"" Michael Bonnet, Elf's director of commercial activities told Reuters.
""What we wish to build in Asia are several (motor racing) schools to develop young drivers from Macau and rest of Asia ... we want to find potential champions in Asia.""
Elf sponsored a Formula Campus Challenge in early November at the China Zhuhai 1996 International Race.
Royal/Dutch Shell, which lost its bid as fuel sponsor to Elf in 1995, said it would tender for the 1997 Macau race.
""Macau and Zhuhai have their individual merits, like individual tenders. Macau belongs to our Hong Kong business (budget) rather than China. We'll try to do it next year,"" Albert Wong, a spokesman for Shell, said earlier last week.
But China, which is determined to muscle its way into the glamourous circuit of international motor racing, is expected to give Macau a good run for its money.
Zhuhai, just 15 km (9 miles) northeast of Macau, boasts a 4.32 km dedicated racing circuit.
The Federation Internationale de L'Automobile (FIA) is conducting a study on whether its is up to standard for endorsement as a suitable Formula One venue.
FIA is also discussing with Chinese officials Zhuhai's possible hosting of a Formula One race in 1997, a senior Zhuhai government said.
""What Zhuhai has done is that it has opened up a whole new area of sponsorship. People who hadn't sponsored car racing before seem to be coming to Zhuhai to see if there's a possibility of being involved in sponsorship,"" de Kantzow said.",0
"Ominous gray clouds scudded over Hong Kong on Sunday as the British colony marked the 100-day countdown to the handover, but there were few physical signs of gloom and doom in the wealthy community of six million.
More than 7,000 Hong Kong people took to the streets to the din of cymbols and kettle drums in a patriotic fervour to celebrate the impending reunion with China at midnight on June 30, 1997.
A stone's throw away, thousands more, most of them westerners and swelled by an influx of visitors, indulged in the ritualistic orgy that has built up around the annual international Rugby seven-a-side tournament.
The tournament was honoured this year, the last under British rule, when Rugby Authorities made it into the world cup event.
The 28th and last British governor, Chris Patten, described Hong Kong as running as smoothly as a Rolls Royce limousine -- but warned China against tinkering with the finely tuned machinery that is the Hong Kong of 1997.
But for the majority of Hong Kong's hardworking citizenry, it was a normal Sunday. A chance for a lie-in, a family gathering at a restaurant -- a day off from work.
With just 100 days to go, Hong Kong is awash in a sea of differing emotions.
Some, like the street revellers, are delighted that more than 150 years of Chinese humiliation is about to end.
""This is a grand and great occasion. In just 100 days, we will return to the Chinese motherland,"" said chief organiser Raymond Wu as the revellers gathered in Victoria Park -- named after the queen who reigned when Britain, at the height of its imperial powers, wrested Hong Kong from China's weak and crumbling Qing dynasty in the mid-19th century.
""We welcome the washing away of over a century of humiliation and shame,"" Wu said to a burst of applause.
Others fret, particularly the pro-democracy camp, about their future under a China that has already put in place plans to dilute civil liberties and dissolve the elected legislative council -- undoing democratic reforms spearheaded by Patten.
A handful of demonstrators, their mouths taped shut in what they said was a symbol of things to come, took up position around the base of Queen Victoria's statue and held up placards condemning China's brutal military crackdown on student-led demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
Many people are simply keeping their fingers crossed.
But Hong Kong, as it enters the last leg of its drawn out transition from British colony to Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, has defied those who forecast a society in chaos, of panic, economic collapse and deserted buildings.
Patten said Hong Kong had reached this moment in its history in first class condition.
He cited a poll conducted earlier this month by the 1997 Transition Project at Hong Kong's Baptist University that found that 90 percent of the people here were happy with life.
Patten said the views that Hong Kong would quickly adjust to the rolling back of freedoms or of more authoritarian government were dubious.
""Hong Kong is, as I said recently, a smoothly functioning community. It's like a Rolls Royce,"" Patten said.
""All you need to do if you're in charge is to slip into the driving seat, switch on the ignition and away you go.
""I don't quite see the point of lifting the bonnet to tinker with the engine. That only raises worries about whether it will work so well, and whether you may be persuaded by some people to start stripping it down for spare parts.""",0
"One of Hong Kong's best-known pro-democracy politicians, Emily Lau, was dragged away kicking and screaming by police after lying down on a road to protest against China's methods of choosing a post-colonial leader.
Up to 40 pro-democracy activists scuffled with riot police outside the Hong Kong Convention Centre, where a committee of 400 chosen by Beijing voted for a chief executive to rule Hong Kong after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30.
A dozen activists shouting ""oppose the phoney election"" lay down on the road and were dragged away by police.
Lau, an independent democrat fiercely critical of China's communist rulers, was among those carried off, witnesses said. It was not immediately clear if they were arrested.
Fellow legislators Andrew Cheng of the Democratic Party and trade union leader Lee Cheuk-yan were also hauled away.
""It's a sad day for Hong Kong. What can ordinary Hong Kong citizens do -- they cannot vote,"" John Wing-ling Tse, a legislator of the Democratic Party said.
Earlier, protesters erected a ""tomb of democracy"" outside the building and condemned the voting as the end of freedom and the rule of law in the territory.
Only the 400 electors chosen by China voted for the future leader. None of the rest of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people had a vote.
Several hundred pro-democracy activists demonstrated on Tuesday evening and 20 diehards camped out overnight with the imitation tomb in front of the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
As the Selection Committee members arrived in shiny limousines, their first sight was an imitation ancient Chinese-style grey arched tomb, constructed from wood.
The structure faced the Hong Kong Convention Centre with the inscription ""Tomb Of Hong Kong Democracy And Rule Of Law"". Candles flickered in the wind beside it.
The committee was convened to carry out the first of two historic tasks -- to elect the man who will step into the shoes of Governor Chris Patten when Britain pulls out. The clear favourite was shipping magnate Tung Chee-Hwa.
The committee's second task, on December 21, is to choose a provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legco (Legislative Council) on July 1.
The scuffles erupted after police urged the demonstrators, from the United Front Against the Provisional Legislature, to move to a cordoned-off area.
Occasionally the group marched a short distance bearing the tomb aloft, as in a funeral procession. In front of the tomb a banner was posted saying ""Death of Hong Kong Rule Of Law"".
""We are against the Selection Committee's so-called election of the first chief executive,"" said Cheng. ""The selection is not real because it is done by Beijing,"" the legislator said.
The protesters brandished a colourful banner with the slogan ""Oppose the False Election Of The Chief Executive, Oppose The Provisional Legislature"" and denounced China for not allowing Hong Kong's electorate to vote.
""This is an abuse of their human rights. Some people are more equal and have more rights. In other cultures it is always your vote that counts. In Hong Kong this is apparently not the case,"" Tse said.
""They say they represent Hong Kong and Hong Kong people but they are not elected. How can they represent us if they are not elected? What is an election with 400 appointees?""",0
"China's state refiner Sinopec is pushing through a series of measures to alleviate diesel shortages that have sparked a bizarre rise in prices in the country since late 1996, Chinese oil sources said this week.
After two successive rises in official diesel prices in the fourth quarter of 1996, Sinopec's Beijing headquarters is now urging its almost 40 refineries to increase the cut of diesel from every barrel of crude they refine.
""Gas oil (diesel) has been in short supply in the country as a whole since the fourth quarter of last year,"" a well-placed Sinopec source said by telephone from Beijing.
""As for Sinopec, we are trying to regulate the production of gas oil as against gasoline to meet market demand,"" he said.
The current gasoline/diesel production ratio stands at 1:1.3 for almost all of China's refineries. But Sinopec in Beijing is pushing for a more suitable ratio of 1:1.4, the source said, adding that the change would take some months to materialise.
Diesel import quotas, which were not fully utilised in 1996 due to high international prices, might also have exacerbated the shortage in the supply chain, and China might be forced to import more this year, the Sinopec source said.
He declined to estimate the amount of diesel likely to be imported this year.
The plan to raise domestic diesel output comes after two officially sanctioned price rises in late 1996 to encourage refiners to produce more diesel, Chinese oil sources said.
Domestic diesel prices had been frozen at 1,900 yuan per tonne since May 1994, when Beijing imposed strict price ceilings to crack down on profiteering. Prices were raised to 1,990 yuan per tonne in October 1996 and 2,190 yuan per tonne in December.
While Beijing, fearful of inflation, keeps a watch on prices, Chinese oil sources admit there is little central authorities can do to prevent flagrant price spikes in far-flung provinces hit by shortages.
""In situations of shortage, provinces can raise prices, it is difficult for Beijing to control,"" the Sinopec source said.
However, some Chinese sources said earlier this week that shortages might only be isolated to some inland provinces as some coastal regions were still enjoying high inventories.
""Storage levels are healthy in some areas,"" said a Singapore-based trader with Chinese state oil trader Sinochem.
Storage terminals at some coastal regions were at full capacity after importers sucked in a massive 1.9 million tonnes that started arriving from mid-January, a Sinopec source in Singapore said.
""Central authorities were afraid there wouldn't be enough for spring and even refiners were urged to crank up their gas oil production,"" he said.
Authorities might have frozen import quotas for now -- until the bottleneck clears -- but it was likely to be short term because China was short of diesel for this year, he added.
A Chinese oil trader from the southern Maoming refinery, China's second largest, said diesel prices had hit as high as 5,000 yuan per tonne in some provinces suffering shortages.
""Prices were between 4,000 and even 5,000 yuan in December in places like Hunan and Sichuan,"" the trader said by telephone earlier this week. Refineries raised prices because their net costs had increased.
Chinese refiners have had sharply reduced profit margins since Beijing raised domestic crude prices by about 110 yuan in January 1996 to between 864 and 794 yuan a tonne on 80 percent of its crude sold within the country.
Fearful of an inflationary backlash, Beijing had, until October, kept prices of all oil products unchanged. Sinopec, which made exceptional profits in 1995 and 1994, bore the brunt of the rise in crude prices.
""Refining margins last year, compared with the earlier two years, were very bad. A lot of our profit went to our upstream companies,"" the Sinopec source said.",0
"The United States envoy in Hong Kong reminded China on Tuesday of its pledge to preserve Hong Kong's ""vital"" freedoms after Britain hands the colony over to China next year and said Washington would be watching.
Richard Boucher, the U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, stopped short of saying what his government could do for the territory if China reneged on its promises after it resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
""As Hong Kong heads towards the transition, the handover has been assuming higher visibility as a factor in U.S. foreign policy... It is one of the key events in Sino-U.S. relations over the next few years,"" Boucher said.
""We have our voice, interest and participation in China and Hong Kong. It is not a threat...but we want to first see what happens,"" he said in a speech to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong.
The freewheeling British colony of over a century and a half is promised far-reaching autonomy for 50 years under a Sino-British treaty and related documents.
Quoting the ancient Chinese sage Confucius, Boucher said a measure of whether Hong Kong was well ruled after 1997 would be if ""its subjects are content and foreigners are attracted"".
He reminded Beijing of its promises made about Hong Kong -- the survival of freedom of speech, press, assembly, movement, travel, religion, among others. ""That is a sweeping, vital and unrestricted pledge,"" he said.
With only 203 days left under the British flag, Hong Kong people are nervous over the future of these freedoms and about China's plan to replace their elected Legislative Council with a provisional legislature, to be chosen this month, overseen by Beijing.
Boucher, echoing criticisms made previously by other senior U.S. diplomats, described the provisional body as ""unnecessary and unjustified"".
""It is important for Hong Kong to have a legislature that is constitutionally elected.""
Boucher refrained from commenting on whether Hong Kong Chinese residents holding U.S. passports would enjoy U.S. consular protection after the handover.
""We do in every case offer consular protection when we can but the question of dual nationality is very complicated...and I can't give details now,"" he said. Some 37,200 U.S. citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them dual nationals.
Boucher also said China had signalled to Washington that U.S. Navy ships could continue to make recreational port visits to Hong Kong after 1997, although details had to be worked out.

"Hong Kong's future leader Tung Chee-hwa met a political opponent on Monday he has accused of badmouthing Hong Kong abroad in the run-up to Chinese rule, holding talks that appeared to strike a conciliatory note.
However, Tung and Democratic Party leader Martin Lee, a fierce critic of China, remained poles apart on key issues at the heart of the democratic camp's worries about Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.
In a meeting he described as ""cooperative"" and ""good"", the second since the shipping magnate was selected in December as Hong Kong's future leader, Lee said his party allowed Tung to clarify his position if he believed he had been misinterpreted.
""If he thinks we have misunderstood him, he can tell us, so we can clear any misunderstanding,"" Lee told reporters.
Lee said he gave Tung a ""position paper"" highlighting issues Lee would be discussing with political and business leaders in an upcoming trip to the United States, Canada and Europe.
The paper stated what the Democrats saw as Tung's stance on key issues about Hong Kong's handover, giving the future leader a chance to clear up any misunderstandings over his position.
Lee, who has made many trips overseas to lobby against the provisional legislature and China's plans to roll back on rights and civil liberties at the handover, has been attacked by Tung in recent weeks for criticising Hong Kong abroad.
But the long-time champion of democracy in the territory, who will receive the National Endowment for Democracy's 1997 Democracy Award on Washington's Capitol Hill on April 9, said he would continue to go on his overseas lobbying trips.
He also dismissed suggestions from the media that the party would censor itself in the future.
""No, we will still speak (overseas), but if Mr Tung says he has been misunderstood, we will consider his views, we will definitely not be censoring ourselves,"" Lee said.
The party also stood firm against the provisional legislature.
""I told Mr Tung so long as this provisional legislature were to have its first, second, third readings on any bill before July 1, we will have no option but take it to court,"" he said.
With the handover just 106 days away, Hong Kong is awash with concerns over the impending end of its elected legislature and Beijing's plans to repeal or amend a string of laws protecting human rights and civil liberties.",0
"Taiwan's call for a ""Greater China"" joint-venture bank on Wednesday was greeted with caution in Hong Kong, where analysts and businessmen said more details were needed to convince the industry of its feasibility.
""It's a good idea. There's certainly a good deal of cross-border trade through Hong Kong,"" said Carmel Wellso, regional banking analyst with ING-Barings.
""But most large corporations would probably have established relationships with existing banks,"" he added. ""What value is this new company going to have?""
A leading Taiwan business leader said on Wednesday in Taipei that Taiwan, China and Hong Kong business heavyweights were considering forming a joint-venture bank in Hong Kong to promote commercial links across the Taiwan Strait.
""We have proposed the idea to our Hong Kong and mainland Chinese counterparts to jointly set up a bank in Hong Kong,"" Hsu Sheng-fa, chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was quoted by an aide as saying.
While most people in Hong Kong contacted by Reuters acknowledged the political significance behind the idea, they said business and profit were what mattered.  
""This idea is very grandiose...but in business, the priority is making money because we have to put in investments,"" said a Hong Kong-based businessmen with strong links to Taiwan.
""Mainland Chinese banks have many restrictions, what will this bank deal in?""
Taiwan's Hsu made the proposal in a meeting with visiting business delegations from Hong Kong and the communist mainland, Taiwan's arch-rival since a civil war split them in 1949.
The Hong Kong and China entrepreneurs were in Taipei for an unofficial economic forum, the first large-scale cross-strait contact since the Taiwan government's November announcement of a freeze on cooperative initiatives with China.
Taiwan has banned direct contact -- including banking communications -- with China since the civil war. Contacts must be conducted through a third region, usually Hong Kong.
Despite the ban and a 17-month-old deadlock in unofficial Taiwan-China talks, some 30,000 Taiwan-funded businesses have poured more than US$20 billion into investments in China since relations began to thaw in the late 1980s.

"China endorsed Hong Kong's Tung Chee-hwa on Thursday as the man to lead the territory after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
The 59-year-old shipping magnate proved the overwhelming choice of a Beijing-vetted panel to lead the territory after the British pull down the flag, ending more than 150 years of colonial rule.
The Preparatory Committee, the 150-strong body of prominent Hong Kong and Chinese citizens established to manage the handover, extended China's recognition of Tung's new role at a session in the southern China boomtown of Shenzhen.
The endorsement was proposed by Preparatory Committee vice-chairman Wang Hanbin. ""If you don't have any objection, then approve it by applauding,"" Wang said.
The delegates, who include some of Hong Kong wealthiest and most powerful tycoons and deal-makers, dutifully clapped in unison.
Tung, whose father fled the Chinese communist revolution in 1949, will take over the helm when the colony reverts to China in 201 days' time, at midnight on June 30.
Tung said on Thursday that China's role in bailing out his family shipping empire when it ran into trouble a decade ago would not affect his leadership.
""Gratitude is one thing. Being the chief executive is another. The chief executive has to put interests of Hong Kong people before anything else,"" Tung said in an interview with Cable Television.
Hong Kong newspapers, many of which had prepared celebratory issues ahead of Wednesday's poll in which Tung eclipsed his two rivals by taking 80 percent of votes cast, heralded him as proof that Hong Kong people could run Hong Kong.
Tung has said he will take a hard line against meddling by provincial bosses who may seek to disregard Beijing's edict that Hong Kong will be a Special Administrative Region of China with considerable autonomy in governing its own affairs.
Hong Kong's Economic Times newspaper said China was expected to rank the future chief executive equal in status to a state councillor.
This position, one level below vice-premier, would mean he outranks provincial governors and would help ensure against interference in Hong Kong affairs by regional cadres, it said.
Tung's victory was considered a foregone conclusion in Hong Kong, where he has been regarded as China's man since President Jiang Zemin singled him out for a pointed handshake in January.
The Preparatory Committee is scheduled to address during the afternoon session what promises to be its most controversial task -- setting the ground rules for a Provisional Legislature in Hong Kong to replace the existing elected chamber.
China, angered by the reforms spearheaded by British Governor Chris Patten, vowed to neutralise them by dissolving Hong Kong's legislature when it takes control.
Navigating this potential minefield could prove Tung's biggest immediate headache.
Opposition in Hong Kong to the new chamber is stiff and many people are deeply concerned about the confusion that may arise if two rival legislatures jockey for power in the final six months of British rule.",0
"China rejected a British challenge to take it to the World Court and staged a vote on Saturday to set up a Hong Kong parliament that will oust elected lawmakers when Beijing recovers the territory next July.
Under heavy security and in a hall decked with red curtains and the Chinese communist red crest with five stars, an elite of 400 carefully chosen Hong Kong electors met in the Chinese city of Shenzhen to pick new legislators for the territory.
The members of the China-controlled Selection Committee cast ballots for the 60-seat legislature in big red envelopes.
They were choosing from 130 pro-Beijing candidates who had been screened by China's representatives in Hong Kong before the selection ballot.
Each elector could list up to 60 names from among the 130 hopefuls, who include 34 incumbent lawmakers.
The result, to be announced later on Saturday, is likely to be denounced by Britain and some of its allies as a travesty of democracy and a breach of handover agreements.
Britain is handing Hong Kong back to China at midnight next June 30 under a treaty that promises the territory of 6.3 million people can keep for 50 years its capitalist system.
Presiding over the gathering in Shenzhen, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attempted to shoot down Britain's World Court threat and said London should wake up to reality.
""What is regrettable is that Britain has lacked the courage to face reality,"" Qian said in a speech before the voting.
""This election should have been held in Hong Kong, but because of Britain's refusal to cooperate we had no choice but to hold it here in Shenzhen.""
On Friday, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind challenged China to go to the International Court of Justice in The Hague to prove the legality of its so-called provisional legislature.
Hong Kong's colonial Governor Chris Patten also attacked the proposed legislature, calling it a ""rubber stamp"" and an ""echo chamber"".
China is creating the body in retaliation for democratic reforms introduced by Patten. The reforms enlarged the mass franchise when the present Legislative Council (Legco) was elected last year with a landslide for pro-democracy forces.
Saturday's vote was a turning point in Hong Kong's future and moved Legco a step closer to oblivion.
Events are moving apace, with less than 200 days to go before the change of flag. Ten days ago the Selection Committee chose Tung Chee-hwa, a 59-year-old shipping magnate with strong pro-Beijing loyalties, to succeed Patten next July 1.
The Hong Kong public has had no say in who should be their first Chinese leader and lawmakers after the British withdrawal. Nor have they had a say in the removal of their elected legislators.
A survey this week showed only a third of Hong Kong people backed the provisional legislature and only a quarter trusted China.
The creation of the interim lawmaking body in Shenzhen was conducted amid tight security.
Trucks towed away suspicious cars hours before the meeting began and guards with binoculars were posted atop the building across the street from the voting hall.
Some of more than 100 journalists, many of whom arrived on Friday, were detained for up to an hour while their travel documents were verified by Chinese border guards.",0
"Chinese flags flew at half mast across Hong Kong, Thursday morning newspapers were delayed and pupils at ""patriotic"" pro-Beijing schools stood in silence after news that China's patriarch Deng Xiaoping had died.
""Deng Dead,"" screamed banner headlines in Hong Kong's Hong Kong's newspapers when they eventually appeared. All devoted acres of newsprint to the life and times of China's paramount leader, who had wanted to visit Hong Kong after it was reunited with China in July this year.
""Come later. Lots of papers are changing their main sections,"" a newspaper hawker told early commuters en route to Hong Kong's Central business district.
Deprived of reading matter many plugged in their headphones and switched between different Hong Kong radio stations.
Some expressed grief but many inhabitants of the British colony of Hong Kong took Deng's demise in their stride.
""I couldn't sleep well the whole night. He was a great leader of our nation. He improved China,"" said Ko Chiu, 80, who was among a group of elderly practioners of Tai Chi, or Chinese shadow boxing.
But another elderly resident Auyeung Pak, 85, paused from his slow jog in a Hong Kong park to shrug off Deng's death.
""It's normal for a man of that old age. I'm not too sad.""
Chinese flags at China's de facto mission in Hong Kong, the Xinhua News Agency, flew at half-mast.
Pupils at the Piu Kiu Middle School, which follows a mainland Chinese curriculum, observed a minute's silence.
Some analysts have predicted Deng's death will create uncertainty in Hong Kong, threatening stability during its delicate transition to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, 1997, a date now 131 days away.
But there was scant sign of much emotion in the business district.
""It's business as usual,"" said an employee of the state-owned bank of China as he hurried into the bank's futuristic highrise headquarters.
He's lucky to have lived for so long,"" said a 55-year-old women, pausing briefly in her tai chi regime.

"China, in a bid to boost the its aerospace industry, this week put on what has been touted as the biggest and costliest airshow it has ever held.
""It has been a dream for years for China's aerospace community to host a grand international airshow,"" Liang Guangda, vice-chairman of the organising committee of Airshow China '96 said on Wednesday.
""(It) will demonstrate the great success of China's reform and opening-up and improve understanding between China and aeronautical communities around the world,"" Liang said.
The six-day airshow at Zhuhai airport in southern Guangdong province, which started on Tuesday, is estimated to have cost China 350 million yuan ($42 million), organisers said.
The show brought together 300 domestic and foreign aircraft and parts producers, including heavyweights like Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas.
Held over a 53,000 square metre site overlooking the South China Sea, China put on show its premier jet fighter the China F-8II, and the Russian SU-27 fighter jet, of which China is known to have sizeable numbers.
And standing prominently in the large open grounds was China's space rocket, the Long March Number 2.
The event has been a venue for local and foreign aviation companies to sign joint venture agreements.
Collins Avionics & Communications Division, a unit of Rockwell International Corp said on Wednesday that it signed a deal with two Chinese parties Shanghai Avionics Corp and Shanghai Broadcast Equipment Factory to develop a tracking system, normally used in aircraft, for ships and cars.
They would form a new joint venture company Shanghai Rockwell Collins Navigation and Communications Equipment Co Ltd in Pudong, Shanghai, to develop the product.
The device, called a global positioning system (GPS), can be used to track location, read tide changes and fuel consumption.
China, eager to make the airshow a biennial event, has left little to chance. Work started in May this year, beginning with building of two large exhibition halls and thousands have been recruited to put together the show, organisers said. (US$1 = 8.33 yuan)",0
"Hong Kong lined up on Thursday to pay its respects to China's dead leader Deng Xiaoping.
Colonial Governor Chris Patten was one of the first to be escorted inside the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's de facto mission in Hong Kong, to offer his condolences. Deng died late on Wednesday at the age of 92.
""I have written to director Zhou Nan, the head of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), expressing my condolences and of course if there is a condolence book opened I will want to sign that with the senior members of my administration,"" Patten told reporters before going in.
Asked if he would sent flowers, he replied: ""I don't think that would be appropriate.""
There has been little love lost between Government House and Xinhua during Patten's four-and-a-half-year tenure as the 28th and last British Governor of Hong Kong.
China denounced Patten as a political prostitute, a criminal for one thousand years and worse for spearheading democratic reforms in the twilight of British rule.
China plans to undo his reforms by dissolving Hong Kong's elected legislature and replacing it with an interim appointed chamber.
Patten was followed on Thursday by the man who will step into his shoes when the colony is handed over to China at the stroke of midnight on June 30, now just 131 days away.
Future leader Tung Chee-hwa, flanked by members of his inner cabinet, bowed three times to a large black and white photograph of Deng.
Hong Kong's politically powerful billionaires and new generation of pro-Beijing politicians turned up in force and were reverently ushered in.
An elderly couple, however, jumped the gun.
They turned up early in the morning, before Xinhua had managed to make arrangements for mourners for the man whose reforms transformed China from a weak, impoverished nation to an emerging economic powerhouse.
They were told to come back in the afternoon.
Five demonstrators staged a brief protest against Deng who they described as ""the Butcher of Beijing"" for his role in the brutal crushing of the student-led pro-democracy movement centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989.
""One man has just died, but so many are mourning for him. Don't forget the number of people who died on June 4,"" they said.",0
"Britain and China have agreed to work on a new anti-espionage law in Hong Kong, to take effect after the colony is handed back to Beijing next year, a Chinese official said on Friday after three days of negotiations.
Chinese Ambassador Zhao Jihua, China's team leader in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) talks, said the countries agreed that Britain's official secrets act would be localised.
""The official secrets act is a British law...which was extended to Hong Kong. Hong Kong has not got its own official secrets act so we are talking about the localisation of the act in Hong Kong,"" Zhao told a news conference.
But Beijing also warned Britain not to rock the boat by making any major legal changes on its own before the territory of 6.3 million people reverts to China next July 1.
Speaking amid heightened anxiety over the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, Zhao also tried to reassure local people they would continue to have complete freedom of movement after 1997.
""For Hong Kong residents, they can rest assured that the freedom of entry and exit into and out of Hong Kong will continue to be guaranteed,"" Zhao said.
But Zhao said Chinese negotiators had protested to Britain about a draft anti-subversion bill unveiled by the colonial administration last week, a law that sets legal markers against China-style jailings of dissidents.
China reacted angrily to the move when it was announced. Britain has accused China of blocking efforts to draft laws on subversion, sedition and treason for the handover.
Zhao said Britain had violated the 1984 Joint Declaration, the Sino-British handover treaty, and Hong Kong's future constitution, the Basic Law.
""During the plenary session, the Chinese side pointed out to the British side that the British action is in fact unilateral change in the law previously enforced in Hong Kong without consultation and consensus with China.
""This is a breach of the Joint Declaration. This act is attempting to legislate on behalf of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China. In essense this is an act which is in contravention of the Basic Law.
""Such an act will never be acceptable to the Chinese side and the British side has to bear full responsibility for all the consequences,"" Zhao said.
He said Beijing hoped there would be no more ""disturbances"" because it ran against the aim of having a smooth transition.

"China on Wednesday gave Hong Kong a free hand to arrange media coverage of the colony's historic handover to Beijing, ending fears that the country's communist rulers might restrict press access.
Chinese and British negotiators working on details of Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty announced the agreement after their latest round of talks.
""We very much look forward to as many as possible of the international press and the local press being interested in participating and recording and reporting on the handover ceremony,"" Hugh Davies, British team chief at the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told reporters.
The JLG negotiates the fine details of the transfer of the territory of 6.4 million people to Chinese rule.
Many in Hong Kong, including human rights activists and pro-democracy politicians, had voiced fears that China would not consent to a media invasion without the right to vet which journalists attended.
In a joint statement both countries said arrangements for media coverage would be made by the Hong Kong government.
""The two sides have agreed to entrust the Hong Kong government to receive and process applications from journalists, as well as handle and arrange other matters relating to media coverage of the handover ceremony,"" the statement said.
Application forms for media accreditation will be distributed by the Hong Kong government's Handover Ceremony Coordination Office from March 15 and should be returned before April 7.
Hong Kong, a British colony for over 150 years, reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, and the government expects 6,000 foreign and local media representatives to cover the event.
Asked if the Hong Kong government would set any special conditions for accreditation, Davies said he did not envisage applicants being turned down.
""There will be no criteria applied ... provided you don't turn out to be a terrorist,"" he told reporters.",0
"Air China, China's largest carrier, plans to increase its international routes next year and will boost its fleet with the addition of five passenger planes, a senior manager said on Wednesday.
""We would be concentrating on expanding our international routes within the ninth five-year plan (1996-2000),"" said Zhang Jinming, general manager of the airline's publicity centre, told Reuters at the China Airshow '96.
The carrier would be starting flights from Beijing and Shanghai to Los Angeles on June 29, 1997, and planned to start routes next year from Beijing to Fushan in South Korea and to Brazil, Zhang said.
The five-day airshow at Zhuhai airport in southern Guangdong province is touted as China's largest and costliest aviation and aerospace exhibition to date, bringing together domestic and foreign aircraft and parts producers.
Increasing demand for domestic and international travel since the start of rapid economic reforms has also boosted China's civil aviation industry. The country now has 30 passenger carriers.
Air China, established in 1955 and China's longest-running carrier, currently flies 44 international and domestic routes, Zhang said.
Flights from China to Los Angeles would either be two or three times a week, he said, adding that the launch dates for service to South Korea and Brazil have yet to be finalised.
The airline, which has a fleet of 64 Boeing passenger jets, would also be taking delivery of three Airbus A340 passenger planes and two Boeing 747s in 1997, Zhang said.
Zhang said the proliferation of Chinese carriers in recent years had given way to cut-throat competition.
""Because of competition, some companies have slashed prices. For us, we have cut by similar amounts, "" he said. But he added that the company, given its long and proven track record, was more keen to conduct business based on reputation.",0
"Hong Kong's colonial Governor Chris Patten on Monday refused a request by future leader Tung Chee-hwa to support the interim legislature China will install in the territory when the British depart next year.
Shipping magnate Tung, emerging from his first meeting with Patten since being chosen on December 11 by a China-controlled committee to head Hong Kong from next July 1, told reporters that Patten flatly refused to provide any help to the new legislature in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty to China.
""I brought up the work of the provisional legislature. I hope Mr Patten and the Hong Kong government can give help,"" Tung told reporters outside Government House, Patten's residence.
""But Mr Patten's position was very clear. I didn't successfully convince him,"" Tung said.
Both men emerged from a 1-1/2 hour meeting to exchange hearty handshakes and make brief speeches to the press, but mentioned little else of what transpired behind closed doors.
Describing the discussion as ""long and constructive"", both said they agreed to meet in the future when the need arose.
Patten, looking serious next to Tung, managed the occasional smile for photographers but turned to lead Tung into a waiting car immediately after his successor completed his short speech.
Neither of them took questions.
Monday's meeting was conducted under a cloud of strained Sino-British relations after China snubbed British objections and went ahead last Saturday with naming the provisional legislature that will replace the current elected Legislative Council (Legco) when Hong Kong returns to Chinese control 190 days from now.
The interim assembly was designed by China to reverse electoral reforms that Patten introduced unilaterally in recent years.
The move came under an international spotlight after British Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind on Friday challenged China to let the World Court rule on the legality of the new assembly.
Patten also lashed out at the new lawmaking body on Saturday, calling its appointment by a 400-member Selection Committee ""a bizarre farce"" and a ""stomach-churning"" process.
""What it shows about China is that, here it is taking over responsibility for a First World economy but they're trying to foist on us political institutions which a Third World country would reject,"" Patten had said.
""Here we are having foisted on us institutions which, frankly, you wouldn't try to run a tennis club with,"" he said.
China, however, has warned Britain against creating problems and to keep out of Hong Kong's affairs after the handover.
""After 1997, Hong Kong will be an internal affair of China. No foreign countries can interfere with China's internal affair,"" China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, told reporters.
""Whether Britain wants to accept my advice is up to it. But if it wants to create more new trouble, I don't think it will be out of the ordinary,"" he said on Monday at a public function.
The controversial new body is dominated by pro-Beijing figures, including 33 incumbent lawmakers and many politicians who lost to pro-democracy candidates in the 1995 Legco election.
The Democratic Party, the biggest single winner in last year's election with 19 of the 60 Legco seats, boycotted the creation of the provisional body, branding it undemocratic.
The Provisional Legislative Council, as it will be known, is to sit from July 1 until a new legislature can be created via elections.",0
"The future leader of Hong Kong said on Thursday he would discuss the legality and funding of the territory's controversial post-colonial assembly with China's legislators during his visit to Beijing this weekend.
""I will discuss with the National People's Congress (NPC) the legal status of the provisional legislature, and also find out more on the arrangements for its funding,"" Tung Chee-hwa told reporters after a public function.
The former shipping boss did not say whether he would ask the Chinese parliament to pass a law to endorse the existence of the provisional legislature, which was formed on December 21 in China's southern city of Shenzhen.
Tung had previously said he may ask the NPC to enact such legislation if the need arose.
Britain and the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong say China's installation of the provisional legislature is illegal under the 1984 United Nations-registered Joint Declaration, which sets out the framework for the colony's returns to China.
China, upset by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's electoral reforms in the twilight of British rule, set up the legislature to reverse these reforms when it resumes sovereignty of the colony at midnight on June 30.
The interim chamber was chosen by a 400-strong Selection Committee, hand-picked by Beijing. The committee also selected Tung to succeed Patten.
Tung has said the provisional legislature would soon hold its first meeting. However it will meet in China, not Hong Kong, in order to avoid a legal challenge by the colony's Democratic Party. The territory's biggest pro-democracy group says it is constitutionally illegal to have two legislatures operating at the same time.
Tung said he would try to persuade the Democrats to accept the provisional body during a meeting with them next Thursday. ""The provisional legislature has the right to exist. I hope that everyone ... can accept it,"" he said.
The chief executive-designate also said he would hold talks with Chinese officials during his two-day visit to the Chinese capital, but would not be more specific.
Tung visited Beijing on December 17 for the first time after his selection as Chief Executive and was received by President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.",0
"Air France is linking up with two major U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines and Continental, in a transatlantic alliance crucial to its ability to keep up with its major European rivals.
The French state airline said on Wednesday it had signed separate letters of intent for cooperation with Delta and Continental after a lengthy search for a U.S. partner.
The long-awaited agreements mark a strategic step in Air France's development and tap the huge U.S. travel market to feed its global network while the U.S. companies will carry the French airline's passengers on their domestic routes.
""These agreements crystallise the company's wish to forge a network of global alliances,"" Air France said in a statement.
The alliances allow so-called code-sharing arrangements between Air France and the U.S. companies, which is a low-cost way of gaining more customers without direct investment.
It means passengers can be issued with a through-ticket by one carrier to be used on its partner airline -- making it possible for airlines to feed passengers to each other without setting up their own routes.
The companies will also harmonise their flight schedules, share a common frequent flyer scheme, and provide ground facilities.
Delta operates from its hub at Atlanta, Georgia, while Continental works from Houston, Texas and Air France uses Paris Roissy-Charles De Gaulle airport.
Air France gave no financial details of the link-ups but a spokeswoman said they were expected to bring the loss-making airline an extra $100 million a year in gross revenues.
The French airline racked up a net loss of more than two billion francs last year after heavy provisions for restructuring, but has said it hopes to be in profit this financial year.
Air France chairman Christian Blanc search for U.S. partners only became possible this year as Air France showed signs of financial recovery and reorganised its global network around a central ""hub"" operation at Roissy Charles De Gaulle airport, giving it a key asset.
This year marks the end of a three-year productivity drive by Blanc to return Air France to break even by 1997 and match the competiveness of its European rivals.
German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG started code-sharing flights with United Airlines in 1994, paving the way for several other high-profile cooperation deals.
French executives fear Washington could hold up any alliance by Air France as a lever to push Paris into opening up the domestic market as part of a bilateral aviation pact.
American Airlines this year agreed a controversial alliance with British Airways Plc but regulatory approval has been held up by a row between the British and U.S. governments over an ""open skies"" agreement.
The planned BA-American alliance has been attacked by rivals as anti-competitive.
Air France cautioned the through-ticketing accords with Continental and Delta were subject to government approvals.
Washington and Paris clashed earlier this year when the United States wanted to open bilateral talks on market access and held up U.S. approval of Air France's summer schedule until the French agreed to start negotiations.

"French subscriber television company Canal Plus said on Friday that it was merging with Nethold, a Dutch satellite television company, to create one of the world's largest pay-TV groups.
Nethold is jointly held by Richemont SA, which is quoted on the Zurich and Johannesburg stock exchanges and MIH Holdings Ltd, a listed holding company.
""This merger is a major strategic move, resulting in the creation of one of the largest television groups in the world...particularly in the field of pay-TV with over 8.5 million subscribers,"" Canal Plus said in a statement.
The new group will have significant positions in France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries and Germany, as well as a presence in several growing markets in central Europe.
The Paris stockmarket authorities had suspended trading in Canal Plus shares on Friday morning, sparking speculation of a link up between the French firm and Nethold.
Its stock closed at 1,169 francs on Thursday.
Utilities group Cie Generale des Eaux, a key shareholder in Canal Plus, said in a separate statement that it was delighted with the merger plan, which marked big step in Canal Plus's international development.
The pact would give the French company access to the fast growing Italian market, Generale des Eaux said.
It would also give the new group greater weight in negotiating purchases of copyrights and open opportunities for the launch of European theme channels.
Generale des Eaux said it was comfortable with its investment in Canal Plus. It said that, in agreement with other Canal Plus shareholders, it would seek to maintain the same scale of investment in the new company.
Under the terms of the deal, Canal Plus will buy 100 percent of Nethold from Richemont and MIH, paying with 6.1 million new Canal Plus shares and $45 million in cash.
Following the issue of new Canal Plus shares, Richemont and MIH will respectively own 15 and five percent of Canal Plus. Cie Financiere Richemont has interests in luxury goods and tobacco and owns such famous brandnames as Cartier, Mont Blanc, Rothmans and Dunhill.
Canal Plus said the deal had the backing of its main shareholders, media group Havas, Generale des Eaux, bank Ste Generale and state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations. It is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.",0

"French electrical equipment company Schneider aims to almost double its return on equity capital to 15 percent in the next three years, executive vice president Michel Staib told Reuters.
""Our objective is to have a net return on capital, before amortisation of goodwill, of 15 percent...in three years,"" he said in an interview. ""It's a reasonable plan.""
That compared to just over eight percent in 1995, he said. The improvement will come from pruning down Schneider to core electrical activities and an internal re-engineering programme.
Schneider shares have risen strongly in the past few weeks as analysts considered the stock undervalued and welcomed the pending sale of the Spie Batignolles unit, which has dragged on the group's results.
The stock has risen around 10 percent since mid-December when news of its Spie sale hit the market. The shares closed on Wednesday at 255.70 francs. About a third of the capital is in non-domestic hands.
All the group companies are profitable and with the sale of construction company Spie Batignolles, Schneider is at a ""diamond point,"" Staib said.
Staib did not rule out further disposals depending on market and technology changes but Schneider is now well-focused.
Schneider will seek growth in emerging markets, in South America and Asia, including India. It wants Asia to contribute at least 20 percent of group turnover before the end of the decade compared to 11 percent in 1995.
Schneider has expanded its operations in China, increasing the number of employees to 2,500 from 200 five years ago.
The company also wants to increase its share in Germany from a tiny three to four percent of a market which Staib says is the world's third largest. Germany accounted for 2.5 percent of turnover in 1995, or three billion francs.
It will seek alliances with other industrial companies rather than acquire firms, as the Germany market is tightly held. Expansion in emerging markets will also be done through local alliances and joint ventures.
Schneider last year bought out Daimler-Benz AG's 50 percent share in AEG Schneider Automation unit.
Schneider posted 1995 sales of 59.42 billion francs and net attributable profit of 817 million. It reported 1996 first half net profit of 503 million francs, at the low end of market expectations.
Schneider is selling Spie to Amec Plc and to Spie employees for one billion francs, subject to regulatory approvals. Amec will gain between 40-48.6 percent of Spie for an injection of 40 million stg.",0
"Just as the submarine changed the face of naval warfare in World War Two, Europe's shipbuilders are hoping a new breed of ""stealth"" warships will do the same in the 21st century.
At a trade fair at the business airport of Le Bourget, north of Paris, three shipbuilders were presenting their own version of combat ships with the ability to hide and deceive the enemy.
British shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft was due on Tuesday to unveil its design for the Sea Wraith corvette at the Euronaval exhibition, which gathers the world's navies.
BAeSema, a joint venture between British Aerospace Plc and France's Sema Group, launched its Cougar coastal corvette project on Monday.
And French state-owned DCN shipyard presented its La Fayette frigate which it boasted was the first operational warship fully to use stealth features in its design.
DCN builds the hulls, while it has linked up with French defence company Thomson CSF to provide the ship's communications, detection and weapons control systems.
Stealth warships use similar principles to the radar-beating technology developed by the U.S. aircraft industry and used in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. The diamond-shaped F117 and batwing B2 bombers were designed to absorb or deflect radar.
But traditionalists who admire the sleek greyhound lines of warships would be dismayed to see the flat, angular shapes forced by the stealth technology which makes modern ships mere ""platforms"" for weapons and detection systems.
The La Fayette uses a slab-sided superstructure and non-metallic composite materials to confuse radar and missiles. The second of eight La Fayette-class ships ordered by Taiwan entered service last week, while Saudi Arabia has also ordered the French ship.
But the British are in hot pursuit with their own designs for a new generation of stealth vessels, which they say they are ready to build now. They have set their sights firmly on export markets for the first customers.
""We believe this is the warship of the future and all warships will need to use these techniques,"" Brian Spilman, Vosper's manager of future projects shipbuilding, told Reuters.
The Sea Wraith design puts the distinctive clutter of mast, radar dishes and aerials inside flat-sided towers and has shaped topsides, rather like diamond facings, to make it hard for radars to lock on. It also uses non-reflective composites.
Sea Wraith can alter its ""radar signature"" by lowering or raising the mast, making it difficult to recognise the craft. Two asymetrically-located masts are meant to confuse radar-guided missiles.
To counter new infra-red, or heat-seeking, missiles, the ship sprays a fine mist of water to conceal itself and its ""hot spots"" such as the exhaust.
BAeSema is showcasing the Cougar patrol vessel, which uses low-acoustic waterjet propulsion instead of traditional noisy engines which are easily picked up by sonar.
Its low, angular lines are typical of stealth designs for throwing off radar beams.
BAe last week announced it was merging its naval systems activities into BAeSema, to boost its prime contractor role.
Prime contractors bid for contracts in which their integration of radar, communications and defence systems provide the added value.
Both BAeSema and Vosper have declined to give prices for their ships, saying these depend on the systems requested.
Thomson-CSF, part of the French state-owned Thomson SA electronics group which is being privatised to the Lagardere conglomerate, is the prime contractor for the La Fayette under Sawari 1 and 2 contracts signed with Saudi Arabia.",0
"French aviation executives said on Tuesday they feared renewed turbulence with the United States over airline market access in France, with flagcarrier Air France caught up in a looming ""air war"".
The U.S. government wants France to sign a bilateral treaty which would grant more landing rights to American airlines, while Paris seeks a gradual market liberalisation.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Paris told Reuters the U.S. authorities had not rejected the new winter schedule for state-owned Air France.
""However, Air France has requested increased services over last winter,"" she said.
""The Department of Transportation has extended the deadline to rule on Air France's request until October 27, thereby giving our government time to discuss the schedule with the French authorities.""
That delay on approving Air France's schedule was seen as a strongarm measure to force Paris into agreeing a new aviation treaty.
""It's like placing a dagger at our throat,"" an aviation executive said. Air France's winter schedule was due to enter service on October 27.
Air France has requested an extra flight to San Francisco, two to Los Angeles and one to Chicago this winter, compared to the 1995 winter schedule. It wants to add extra cargo capacity from March to Miami and Chicago.
A second French executive said if the United States took unilateral measures, Paris would not hesitate to retaliate against U.S. airlines, as it did in March when U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena rejected Air France's summer schedule.
Paris cut landing rights of six U.S. airlines before the junior transport ministers of both countries, meeting in Paris, agreed to open talks aimed at reaching a treaty to replace one which expired in 1992.
Without such a treaty, each route and landing rights have to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis, whereas Washington would like a global, market-driven solution.
Separately, Washington is withholding approval of a planned alliance between American Airlines and British Airways Plc until Britain agrees an ""open skies"" treaty with the United States.",0
"The French government, belatedly attempting to consolidate a fragmented aerospace industry, on Wednesday gave the green light for aero-engine maker Snecma to buy up rocket engine manufacturer SEP.
State-owned Snecma already owns 51 percent of Societe Europeene de Propulsion (SEP) and wants to buy out minority shareholders to make it a wholly-owned subsidiary. The enlarged group would have annual sales of around 15 billion francs ($2.9 billion).
""The government has been advised of Snecma's wish to raise its holding in the capital of SEP from 51 percent to 100 percent and has given its approval so Snecma's board can make a public offer for SEP shares, followed by, if the 95 percent threshold is reached, a mandatory buy-in,"" the Finance Ministry said in a statement.
The deal has a strong industrial logic and would ensure Snecma's future in space programmes and its position as France's centre for engine manufacture, it said.
SEP makes engines and boosters for Ariane rockets, used by the European Arianespace consortium.
Snecma makes civilian and military aero engines including those for passenger jets of the Airbus Industrie consortium and Dassault Aviation combat planes.
The buy-in, for which no financial details were available, reverses a policy drawn up by Snecma's previous chairman, Bernard Dufour, who wanted to dispose of SEP and Messier Bugatti, Snecma's aircraft brakes unit, to raise cash.
""Previously envisaged, the sale of SEP is no longer on the agenda"", said a Snecma staff note made available to Reuters.
Although the SEP sale would have brought in fresh cash, it also risked weakening the Snecma group by losing know-how essential for future transports such as a second generation supersonic plane and hypersonic aircraft, the note said.
It would also have meant the loss for SEP of Snecma's technical support, which has helped it in the past.
Snecma's new chairman, Jean Paul Bechat, has said asset sales should not be used to make up operating losses and that the company's deficits would only be tackled by meeting a targeted 1.5 billion francs in cost cuts in a restructuring plan.
In addition, the government has adopted an industrial policy for the defence sector which relies on consolidating each sector on a business basis. Snecma was thus the natural centre for SEP, to build a propulsion group in aeronautics and space, it said.
The move would also consolidate Snecma's brakes activities by bringing together SEP's Carbone-Industrie subsidiary with Snecma's Messier Bugatti to create a bigger entity.
Brakes make up around eight percent of Snecma's sales, with potential to grow into areas such as cars and trains.
The buyout will help SEP through a difficult period in the next few years as its order book falls when the Arianespace space consortium transfers launches to the new Ariane 5 rocket from the existing Ariane 4.
SEP makes the rocket motors for the Ariane 5, which has one huge Vulcain engine instead of the up to 10 Viking and HM 7 motors in Ariane 4. Competition from the United States, Russia, Ukraine, China and Japan is also expected to put severe price pressure on rocket launchers.
SEP also makes ballistic missiles and its proposed M5 replacement for the M45 was only adopted in the six-year defence budget on condition that there would be big cost reductions and reorganisations among the industrial partners.
The takeover will create a group with synergies in aeronautical and space engines, making it virtually unique in Europe, a Snecma spokesman said.
Snecma made a 1995 net loss of 1.24 billion francs and expects to make a loss in 1996 and next year before returning to profit in 1998. Turnover for 1996 is expected to total 9.2 billion francs, up from 8.6 billion in 1995 but still lower than 1994's 10.39 billion.",0
"France's national audit office on Monday criticised a lack of clarity and insufficient competition in the water supply market, dominated by two giant companies Cie Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
""There is a high degree of concentration. That is not to say competition is absent, but it is organised competition,"" said Francois Logerot, author of the Cour des Comptes (court of auditors) report.
""It may be that concentration in this sector is accentuated by agreements between these companies...sometimes by creating joint subsidiaries at the request of local councils.""
Logerot cited as an example the Saint-Etienne city council, where the water company Societe Stephanoise des Eaux is jointly owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez and Generale des Eaux (CGE).
The report, presented at a news conference, said the private sector held 75 percent of the supply of drinking water in France in 1991, up from 60 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1954.
The price of water rose by a national average 47.7 percent from 1990 to 1994, it said.
Significant price rises occurred where contracts were awarded to the private sector, Logerot said.
""Sometimes there was a catch-up effect but there were also excesses and abnormal situations.""
Lyonnaise officials were not available for comment. But CGE noted in a statement that the report said the main reason for rising water prices was higher quality and increasing investment needs.
It said the official audit pointed to a near doubling of the cost of water treatment between 1990 and 1995, while the price to the consumer rose by 30 percent.
Logerot said local authorities often awarded contracts to the water companies in exchange for payments which the companies then recovered in the price charged to customers.
The study followed a 1995 law which banned ""right of entry"" payments that water companies paid to win an operating licence.
The report cited the Alpine city of Grenoble, where a contract with Lyonnaise des Eaux resulted in the conviction for bribery of the mayor, former Gaullist minister Alain Carignon.
Grenoble used the proceeds of the water contract to finance its general expenditure, while accounting principles call for water expenses to be kept separate from the general budget.
The CGE statement said much of the criticism in the report related to the past, when payment for contracts was legal. It added that the company was pleased such payments were banned and the duration of those contracts was limited.
CGE said the water market was highly competitive and 1996 had shown that when contracts expired, there was competition to win new licences. The sector was also subject to strict controls by a number of public bodies, including competition and quality experts.
The audit office called for tighter water management and said higher water quality standards contained in a 1992 law would require annual investment of around 14 billion francs.",0
"The French government sold a nine percent stake in oil major Elf-Aquitaine on Wednesday, raising around 10 billion francs ($2 billion) and allowing the energy group to buy back a big chunk of its own shares.
The disposal follows a sharp rise in the Paris bourse in recent weeks and, specifically of oil stocks which have benefited from high world oil prices.
""Finance minister Jean Arthuis has decided to sell 24.9 million shares in Elf-Aquitaine held by the ERAP company, which will reduce the stake held by this public sector firm in Elf-Aquitaine to 0.75 percent,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The sale involved the placement of 12.5 million Elf shares, or 4.6 percent of the capital, at 417.50 francs per share to French and international institutions.
Elf said in a separate statement it had bought a 4.5 percent stake through its indirectly-owned financial Fingestval company as a long-term investment, accounting for the remainder of the shares sold by the state.
Elf shares slipped 2.5 francs to 423 by 1300 GMT.
The 10 billion francs will go into a government special account held for share sale proceeds, which is reserved for injecting into other state-owned companies, the ministry said.
Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure said the money would be used to recapitalise state-owned companies which needed it, particularly those being privatised.  It will not be used to help reduce the government's budget deficit.
France plans to recapitalise Thomson SA to the tune of 11 billion francs before selling the state-owned electronics group to Lagardere Groupe and Daewoo Electronics Corp.
The Elf share sale leaves a rump 0.75 percent of Elf stock in government hands, which covers free shares due to Elf employees and non-voting petroleum certificates held by the state.
Elf was among the early privatisations in the previous conservative government of Edouard Balladur in February 1994 (Corrects timing of Elf privatisation), when it was floated at 385 francs per share to private investors.
The group has wide-ranging interests in oil exploration, production and refining, as well as health and beauty products through its Sanofi unit.
It is a major constitutuent in the Paris CAC-40 share index.
The group's stock purchase would boost earnings per share, chairman Philippe Jaffre said: ""This removes the uncertainty surrounding the French state's interest in the company which has weighed on the share price.""
""The acquisition will automatically improve earnings per share,"" he said in a company statement.
The sale to institutions was handled by Paribas and SBC Warburg, after a tender with various banks. ABN Amro Rothschild acted as adviser to the government.",0
"A planned sale of French television maker Thomson Multimedia to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics for a symbolic one franc has sparked a political backlash against the government's privatisation plans.

The leader of the French Socialist Party, Lionel Jospin, told France 3 state-owned television on Sunday he was ""shocked"" by the Thomson privatisation.
""This was a public sector firm and concerned the national interest. It has been privatised for ideological reasons"", he said.
""I was shocked by the method, which was despicable and perhaps even illegal as the 1986 (privatisation) law specifically called for the parliamentary privatisation committee to give a supporting opinion,"" he said.
Jacques Delors, former president of the European Commission, told a conference in Paris on Sunday, ""I would have preferred to maintain a European pole in consumer electronics.""
On Monday, French business newspaper La Tribune Desfosses added to the controversy by reporting that a French businessman, whom it did not identify, was preparing a bid for Thomson Multimedia to keep the company French.
The report said it was only after the government declared its preference last Wednesday for Lagardere's bid over a rival offer from Alcatel Alsthom that authorities realised ""the value of the gift it (the state) was making to Daewoo.""
A Thomson-CSF spokesman declined to comment on the report of a ""white knight"" bidder.
A Lagardere spokesman said bids had closed in September and if investors were interested in Multimedia, they would have to negotiate with Daewoo after it had bought the firm.
Jospin said French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe were allowing the sale of Thomson Multimedia to Daewoo, which would reap the benefits of French state financing for the group's digital technology.
""Thanks to state finances, it will be able to take up a strong position in the digital (television) market and be profitable from 1999,"" Jospin said.
Thomson Multimedia is set to make big profits in 1999, when revenues from technology licences will contribute at least one billion francs ($192.3 million) a year. The licences were acquired when Thomson bought RCA of the United States from General Electric in 1987 but only revert to Thomson after 1998.
""We are not hostile to a foreign company taking control of Thomson Multimedia as it follows an industrial and economic logic,"" a spokesman for the Thomson-CSF association of employee shareholders said.
But, he added, it was a pity the state had not played its part as a shareholder to recapitalise the group earlier.
A source close to Thomson said the group's financial situation was untenable as its share capital was insufficient to sustain its debt and that it was in dire need of fresh funds.
But the government is tightening its belt as it cuts public spending to meet tough requirements to join the single European currency by 1999. The Thomson privatisation was also launched as part of the government's consolidation of the defence industry.
The Thomson Multimedia unit, the world's fourth-largest TV maker, reported a loss of three billion francs in the first half of 1996. It has invested heavily in digitial television technology and is a leader in television decoders, as well as a being a member of the Digital Video Disc consortium.
The chairman of the South Korean company, Bae Soon-Hoon, has said he is ready to invest $1.5 billion in France and create 5,000 new jobs if he wins Multimedia.",0
"The European Airbus consortium said on Tuesday it was confidently pressing ahead with studies on a 555-seat passenger plane despite a decision by archrival Boeing to scale back work on a larger jumbo jet.
Boeing on Monday said market conditions did not justify the risk and expense of building a new version of its 747 jumbo jet, the 747-X, and it was diverting half the 1,000 staff on that project to smaller planes.
""We are confident the A3XX will meet market needs,"" an Airbus spokesman said. ""The signs from major airlines working with us on shaping the A3XX are definitely encouraging.""
Airbus, ever quick to seize on any perceived gaps in Boeing's armour, says airlines want an all-new plane rather than Boeing's 747-X, which the Airbus spokesman said was the ""end of the line for a product developed in the late 1960s"".
""Airlines want to fly into the 21st century facing forward, not backwards,"" the spokesman added.
Airbus must attack Boeing's monopoly on the large-capacity segment and is studying designs for an A3XX product family which it hopes to launch in 1998 for service in 2003.
It wants to grab at least half of the aircraft market by the end of the decade, up from its estimated historic share of 35 percent. But it lacks large planes to compete with Boeing's 777 giant twinjet and the best-selling 747 jumbo.
The four-nation consortium differs with Boeing over the potential market and development costs for a new large plane.
Airbus forecasts a market of 1,383 planes seating more than 400 passengers over the next 20 years, while Boeing believes demand would only stretch to 470 planes seating 500 or more, which would not allow it to get a return on its money.
A basic A3XX would cost around $200 million, giving potential sales worth more than $275 billion on the Airbus forecast.
""A split market would have been a big challenge for two manufacturers but now Boeing is opting out, that enhances our prospects,"" the Airbus spokesman said.
Airbus accepts the view that the market will fragment further as people want to fly more frequently, non-stop, long distance between city pairs.
The ""fragmentation"" effect was one of the factors cited by Boeing for cutting demand for larger planes and reducing the importance of big airport hubs.
But Airbus believes it will meet that market change with its A340 long-haul plane and that the A3XX will co-exist.
Saturation of air routes and airport landing slots calls for higher capacity planes, it argues. Countering critics who point to already lengthy waits at airports, it says its A3XX designs would allow a quicker passenger turnaround than the jumbo.
Airbus is talking to 14 leading airlines on what the plane should offer and is confident that it can match or better the airlines' operating demands. These include fitting within an 80 metre ""box"" at the airport terminal.
It is officially sticking to its estimated $8 billion development cost for the A3XX, despite scepticism among some experts that it cannot be done for less than $15 billion.
Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerospace (part of Daimler-Benz) and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.",0
"French President Jacques Chirac looked set on Wednesday to achieve his ambition of creating a national defence giant to rival huge U.S. conglomerates through the planned merger of Lagardere's Matra with Thomson- CSF.
The government announced on Wednesday it preferred a bid by missile-maker Lagardere Groupe for electronics firm Thomson SA over a rival one by civilian engineering group Alcatel Alsthom. Both offers have been referred to the independent Privatisation Commission.
The preference for Lagardere seems to vindicates the integration sought by Noel Forgeard, chairman of Lagardere's Matra unit, who has fought a highly-public campaign for Thomson, in order to win its Thomson-CSF defence arm.
The deal will ""indisputably strengthen the missiles activity in France and particularly Europe,"" said Jean-Marc Baron, a partner specialising in defence at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick. ""The merger wil create a critical mass,"" he added.
Matra specialises in air-to-air missiles with the Magic and Mica weapons, while Thomson-CSF has ground-to-air missiles including the Crotale NG (New Generation) and Starstreak very- short-range missile built with Shorts Brothers Plc, a unit of Canada's Bombardier.
The addition of Thomson-CSF reinforces a vital joint venture between Matra and British Aerospace Plc to create Matra BAe Dynamics, which Lagardere wants to be the pole for future European industrial concentration.
Besides the missile synergy, Baron pointed to the benefits of marrying Thomson-CSF's radar and communications expertise with Matra's space satellites, which will give Thomson access to a new market.
Lagardere has major space interests with its Matra Marconi Space (MMS) joint venture with GEC Plc of Britain and also wants to use this a platform for building a single European satellite giant, to make the most of scarce funds.
This vertical integration of detection, communications and weapons makes the future Thomson Matra a powerful ""systems"" player rather than a seller of separate products. Each of these segments has annual turnover of about $1-$2 billion, Baron said.
In the United States, the defence industry has quickly consolidated through $40 billion of mergers and acquisitions to create giants such as Lockheed Martin. Integration is seen as key, with firms such as Hughes, a unit of General Motors, not only building missiles and satellites but also operating the satellites.
European and U.S. defence firms have had to adapt to shrinking military spending since the end of the Cold War and soaring research and development costs. But Europe has lagged in that restructuring due to differing national interests.
With the aid of Matra's links with BAe and GEC and through overtures to Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa), Forgeard wants to forge a European grouping which would have world class status in terms of turnover and product range.
Chirac launched the privatisation of Thomson SA in February as part of a restructuring of France's fragmented defence industry, widely seen by analysts as a vital step toward a badly needed consolidation of European capacity.",0
"Shares in debt-mired Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA fell on Tuesday after they were requoted following a week's suspension amid disappointment over terms of its restructuring with creditor banks.
The troubled Anglo-French company unveiled on Monday details of the refinancing its 69.6 billion francs ($13.50 billion) of junior-ranked bank debt after a year of complex negotiations with bank lenders.
The shares closed down 8.74 percent at 8.35 francs on heavy volume of 20 million shares. They were at 9.15 francs when they were suspended on September 30 in the runup to the debt deal.
Analyst Jean Borgeix at broker Pinatton said the stock market was disappointed with the 10.40 franc price that banks will be getting new Eurotunnel shares at as part of an eight billion franc equity-for-debt deal.
The market had been looking for a conversion price of between 12-15 francs per share, he said.
Current shareholders also stand to effectively ""lose"" 30 percent of Eurotunnel's future cashflow, as this is the percentage earmarked for paying the ""stabilisation notes"" it would issue to banks in return for an interest-free credit line.
The company negotiated the right to issue the stabilisation notes in case it fell short of cash to meet interest payments. It can issue up to 14.8 billion francs of the notes.
Factoring in that loss of future cashflow gave the shares a present value of around 8.5 francs a share.
Another French analyst said: ""The restructuring assures the industrial viability of the project, even though the shares remain a risky investment.""
The debt deal looked good on paper and the zero-interest stabilisation notes provided Eurotunnel with a last line of defence if its cash failed to meet interest payments, he said.
A trader at a major U.S. brokerage in Paris said the share price suffered from the dilution of equity due to the debt pact.
The restructuring will dilute the holdings of current shareholders to 54.5 percent of the capital after the debt swap.
The complex agreement also includes issuing eight billion francs of bonds redeemable in shares, which could further dilute the equity holders to 39.4 percent if the banks exercised their conversion rights at 12.40 francs per share.",0
"Troubled Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA/Plc is due to release first-half results on Monday but analysts said any attempt to forecast the figures was futile, given the uncertainties over its debt restructuring.
""Everything depends on resolving the financial situation. If they announce a good figure...that might help, but it's really a face-off between the company and the bankers,"" Olivier Machou, analyst at brokerage Leven said.
Eurotunnel needs to agree a refinancing of its $12.3 billion bank debt by the end of September, having asked in July for two court-appointed mediators to stay on to negotiate a deal with its some 220-strong bank syndicate.
Machou said it was hard to forecast results due to ""dumping"" in the price war between Eurotunnel and ferry companies as they battle for a share of cross-Channel traffic between Britain and France.
""It's not a stock that you can take a view based on half-year figures, especially as the first half comes before the summer season,"" one analyst said.
However, one analyst at a large French brokerage said he had a rough forecast of a 2.5 billion franc ($492 million) net loss and an operating loss of around 100 million.
The Channel Tunnel operator posted first-half sales of 1.79 billion francs, up from 806 million a year ago. It made a net loss for the full year last year of 7.196 billion francs on turnover of 2.266 billion.
The headline figures will likely be flattered by the fact that Eurotunnel did not have all its services running a year ago, said Jeff Summers, head of research at debt specialist Klesch and Co in London.
Stripping out the minimum usage fee that the railway operators pay, he expected a 25-30 percent improvement in the underlying results from a year ago.
In sterling terms, Summers has pencilled in a 22 million pound ($34.45 million) pretax, pre-interest loss versus 121 million a year ago. With benign currency movements, it may break even.
Operating cashflow should at least double to 56 million sterling before interest and capital expenditure, compared with 29 million.
""Everything is going in its favour,"" Summers said. He cited the British government's recent decision to allow cooperation between ferry companies to pool their capacity and the European Commission's decision not to extend the duty-free sales regime beyond 1999.
Pooling by rivals such as P&O and Stena would lead to ""a reduction in direct competition"" for Eurotunnel, while the loss of duty-free sales, representing 250 million sterling of soft subsidies for the ferries, would push ferry firms to raise ticket prices.
Eurotunnel could then raise its prices and boost turnover.
The cross-Channel market has also grown much faster even than Eurotunnel forecast, with traffic up 20 percent last year and estimated growth of 13-15 percent this year, Summers said.
Richard Branson, head of the London & Continental Railways (LCR) group which runs the Eurostar high-speed train concession, has forecast it will hit six million passengers in the financial year 1996/97 and 10 million in 18 months.",0

"France's national audit office criticised on Monday a lack of clarity and insufficient competition in the water supply market, dominated by two giant companies Cie Generale des Eaux and Lyonnaise des Eaux.
""There is a high degree of concentration. That is not to say competition is absent, but it is organised competition,"" said Francois Logerot, author of the Cour des Comptes (court of auditors') report.
""It may be that concentration in this sector is accentuated by agreements between these companies...sometimes by creating joint subsidiaries at the request of local councils.""
Logerot cited as an example the Saint-Etienne city council, where the water company Societe Stephanoise des Eaux is jointly owned by Lyonnaise des Eaux Dumez and Generale des Eaux (CGE).
The report, presented at a news conference, said the private sector held 75 percent of the supply of drinking water in France in 1991, up from 60 percent in 1980 and 31 percent in 1954.
The price of water rose by a national average 47.7 percent from 1990 to 1994, it said.
Significant price rises occurred where contracts were awarded to the private sector, Logerot said.
""Sometimes there was a catch-up effect but there were also excesses and abnormal situations.""
But CGE noted in a statement that the report said the main reason for rising water prices was higher quality and increasing investment needs.
It said the official audit pointed to a near doubling of the cost of water treatment between 1990 and 1995, while the price to the consumer rose by 30 percent.
Logerot said local authorities often awarded contracts to the water companies in exchange for payments which the companies then recovered in the price charged to customers.
The study followed a 1995 law which banned ""right of entry"" payments that water companies paid to win an operating licence.
The report cited the Alpine city of Grenoble, where a contract with Lyonnaise des Eaux resulted in the conviction for bribery of the mayor, former Gaullist minister Alain Carignon.
Grenoble used the proceeds of the water contract to finance its general expenditure, while accounting principles call for water expenses to be kept separate from the general budget.
Lyonnaise said in a statement that each water company had given details of its contracts to the audit office and, of the 12,000 in France, only about 20 had drawn explicit comment. And these had been agreed under conditions prevailing before the 1995 law.
The CGE statement said much of the criticism in the report related to the past, when payment for contracts was legal. It added that the company was pleased such payments had been banned and the duration of those contracts was limited.
CGE said the water market was highly competitive and 1996 had shown that, when contracts expired, there was competition to win new licences. The sector was also subject to strict controls by a number of public bodies, including competition and quality experts.",0
"European aircraft maker Airbus looks set to soar higher in 1996 following a bumper order from airline USAir on Wednesday, but tough decisions still need to be made on its products and ownership to secure the long-term future.
Airbus Industrie announced on Wednesday one of the biggest orders in aviation history with the Pittsburgh-based airline's command for 120 planes in the A320 narrow-body family of passenger jets and options for a further 280. List price for the orders was estimated at $5.3 billion.
The USAir victory follows Monday's order by Emirates, a Gulf-based airline, for 16 Airbus A330-200s worth $2 billion, which beat out a rival offer of Boeing Co's 767.
""The order backlog is really healthy,"" Emmanuel Dubois Pelerin, analyst at ratings agency S&P Adef said. The order book would sustain or even increase production rates for 1997 and 1998, he added.
An Airbus spokesman confidently forecast the consortium would rack up firm orders this year exceeding 300 planes, compared to 106 last year.
While there are no worries on products and profitability for the next two or three years there are uncertainties further ahead stemming from Airbus' change in legal status and implications for projects, particularly the A3XX large plane and stretched A340 long-range jet.
Airbus is a partnership made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.
In the interests of increasing market responsiveness and competitiveness, Airbus wants to change into a joint stock company by 1999. Discussions are being held among the partners to decide the shape of the future company.
It also has to find external financing for the 3XX plane.
Airbus has said it wants to find between 30-40 percent of external risk sharing for the 3XX, which it estimates will cost $8 billion to develop.
Dubois Pelerin said he believed Airbus would have to choose to build either the stretched A340-600 or the 3XX, as running both at the same time would overload its finances,
But the Airbus spokesman said the consortium would be able to finance development of both the 340-600 and the 3XX, with the stretched 340 a top priority in the near term.
Airbus is under severe time pressure to come up with a rival to Boeing's monopoly at the large-capacity segment with its 777 and 747 combination which hit Airbus hard in 1995.
Boeing is studying the 747-500X and 747-600X derivatives of its Jumbo jet, which has been a cashcow since it entered service in the 1970s, but which nearly broke the company in development.
The new jumbos are expected to cost around $200 million a piece, which industry sources said prompted Airbus' senior vice-president commercial John Leahy to announce earlier this week that the 3XX would cost $198 million.
The Airbus supervisory board last month asked for the business case for the 340-600 to be presented in mid-December to allow an early decision on whether to launch the product. If it were launched, the 376-seater could be in service in late 2000 and head off competition from the early versions of the 747.
If the 555-seater 3XX goes ahead, it would fly in 2003 and tackle the 747 derivatives.
A signature earlier this week with Rolls-Royce Plc on using its Trent engine for the 3XX will allow Airbus to supply important performance data such as fuel burn, range and take-off and landing weight to the airlines it is talking to for its marketing studies.",0
"French subscriber television company Canal Plus said on Friday it was merging with Nethold, a Dutch satellite television company, to create one of the world's largest pay-TV groups.
Nethold is jointly held by Richemont SA, which is quoted on the Zurich and Johannesburg stock exchanges, and MIH Holdings Ltd, a listed holding company.
""This merger is a major strategic move, resulting in the creation of one of the largest television groups in the world...particularly in the field of pay-TV with over 8.5 million subscribers,"" Canal Plus said in a statement.
The new group will have significant positions in France, Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, the Benelux countries and Germany as well as a presence in several growing markets in central Europe.
The Paris stockmarket authorities had suspended trading in Canal Plus shares on Friday morning, sparking speculation of a link up between the French firm and Nethold.
Its stock closed at 1,169 francs on Thursday.
Utilities group Cie Generale des Eaux, a key shareholder in Canal Plus, said in a separate statement it was delighted with the merger plan, which marked big step in Canal Plus's international development.
The pact would give the French company access to the fast-growing Italian market, Generale des Eaux said.
It would also give the new group greater weight in negotiating purchases of copyrights and open opportunities for the launch of European theme channels.
Generale des Eaux said it was comfortable with its investment in Canal Plus. It said that in agreement with other Canal Plus shareholders, it would seek to maintain the same scale of investment in the new company.
Under the terms of the deal, Canal Plus will buy 100 percent of Nethold from Richemont and MIH, paying with 6.1 million new Canal Plus shares and $45 million in cash.
Following the issue of new Canal Plus shares, Richemont and MIH will respectively own 15 and five percent of Canal Plus.
Cie Financiere Richemont has interests in luxury goods and tobacco and owns such famous brandnames as Cartier, Mont Blanc, Rothmans and Dunhill.
Canal Plus said the deal had the backing of its main shareholders, media group Havas, Generale des Eaux, bank Societe Generale, and state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations.
It is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.",0
"Air France is linking up with two major U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines and Continental, in a transatlantic alliance crucial to its ability to keep up with its major European rivals.
The French state airline said on Wednesday it had signed separate letters of intent for cooperation with Delta and Continental after a lengthy search for a U.S. partner.
The long-awaited agreements mark a strategic step in Air France's development and tap the huge U.S. travel market to feed its global network while the U.S. companies will carry the French airline's passengers on their domestic routes.
""These agreements crystallise the company's wish to forge a network of global alliances,"" Air France said in a statement.
The alliances allow so-called code-sharing arrangements between Air France and the U.S. companies, which is a low-cost way of gaining more customers without direct investment.
It means passengers can be issued with a through-ticket by one carrier to be used on its partner airline -- making it possible for airlines to feed passengers to each other without setting up their own routes.
The companies will also harmonise their flight schedules, share a common frequent flyer programme, and provide ground facilities.
Delta operates from its hub at Atlanta, Georgia, while Continental works from Houston, Texas and Air France uses Paris Roissy-Charles De Gaulle airport.
Air France gave no financial details of the link-ups but a spokeswoman said they were expected to bring the loss-making airline savings of $100 million a year.
The airline racked up a net loss of more than two billion francs last year after heavy provisions for restructuring, but has said it hopes to be in profit this financial year.
Air France chairman Christian Blanc has for months been looking for a heavyweight partner to give the airline a global reach and counter the spread of alliances between its rivals.
Air France has previously said it was talking to Continental and Delta, as well as American Airlines of AMR Corp, United Airlines of UAL Corp and USAir Group.
German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG started code-sharing flights with United Airlines in 1994, paving the way for several other high-profile cooperation deals.
American Airlines this year agreed a controversial alliance with British Airways Plc but regulatory approval has been held up by a row between the British and U.S. governments over an ""open skies"" agreement.
The planned BA-American alliance has been attacked by rivals as anti-competitive.
French newspapers have said Washington is squaring up for another struggle with France over a bilateral ""open skies"" pact and would use any alliance by Air France as a lever to push the French to further open up the domestic market.
Air France cautioned the through-ticketing accords with Continental and Delta were subject to government approvals.
Washington and Paris clashed earlier this year when the United States wanted to open bilateral talks on market access and held up U.S. approval of Air France's summer schedule until the French agreed to start negotiations.
Air France and Continental signed a commercial accord back in 1993 but it has never been implemented due to changes in top management at both companies. Continental, among the U.S. majors, does not have a European partner.",0
"A restructuring agreed between Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel SA /Plc and bank negotiators on its 69.6 billion francs of debt was a ""robust"" deal, French co-chairman Patrick Ponsolle said on Monday.
He told a news conference the restructuring was robust as it would eliminate a total 16 billion francs of debt by swapping eight billion of loans into equity and a further eight billion for equity notes.
The plan secured the company's future until 2003, when the London-Folkestone high-speed rail link would be built, he said.
""After 2003 we will see an explosion of revenues from the railways,"" Ponsolle said.
The restructuring meant the interest bill would be fixed at 5.2 percent or 3.21 billion francs for the seven-year period. That rate was much lower than market rates, the company said.
If there is a cashflow shortage to repay interest, it will be able to draw down on stabilisation notes, which are effectively a credit line, free of interest until January 2006.
The plan also pushed back the debt repayment periods by a significant period, Ponsolle said. The resettable bonds mature in 2050, the participating loan notes in 2040, the remaining junior debt in 2025 and stabilisation notes in 2026.
Eurotunnel has also negotiated the right to refinance all its debt after 2004, free of penalties, to benefit from any improvement in market conditions. Previously, that refinancing incurred heavy financial penalties.
The deal had been worked out using a wide range of scenarios and sought to preserve the company's future and independence, Ponsolle said. ""It is the best compromise under the circumstances. The sacrifices for shareholders and banks are equal and equitable.""
The two chief aims of the deal were ""to preserve a clear majority for the shareholders and to ensure long-term financial stability,"" he said.
Although the company planned to pay a first dividend in around 10 years, if it performed very well it could make a payment at the date envisaged in the 1994 rights issue -- 2004.
Asked what would happen if shareholders rejected the deal, Ponsolle said, ""I think we would go back to the choices at the starting point. The starting point was either we come to a friendly agreement or insolvency.""
""I think, contrary to some, an insolvency could only be a catastrophe for the small shareholders.""
Prices should rise ""to a reasonable level"" following the merger announcement last week of P&O and Stena of their cross-Channel operations, Ponsolle said.
The merger news had come as a surprise to Eurotunnel, which had not expected such a move until later, perhaps in 1997, he said.
The earliest Eurotunnel could hold a shareholders' meeting to vote on the deal would be late March or early April, he said.",0
"Barrick Gold Corp. completed its C$1 billion takeover of the promising smaller exploration company Arequipa Resources Ltd. Tuesday, solidifying its position as the world's third biggest gold producer.
""We are pleased that Arequipa shareholders have chosen so overwhelmingly to accept this offer,"" Barrick Chairman Peter Munk said in a statement. ""We now have the opportunity to realize the potential of Arequipa's excellent assets.""
A total of 93 percent of Arequipa shareholders accepted Barrick's C$30 ($21.94) a share bid overnight, and Barrick said it plans to exercise its right to buy the remaining shares.
Barrick said it will have to spend at least C$512 million ($374 million) and issue about 13.4 million shares to complete the takeover, giving the deal a total value of C$1.02 billion ($745 million) based on the closing price for Barrick stock Tuesday.
The acquisition gives Barrick, North America's largest gold mining company, ownership of Arequipa's prize possession, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru.
While exploration on the property is in its early stages, some experts have speculated the deposit has potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces of high-quality gold.
Barrick originally offered Arequipa shareholders C$27 a share July 11 to take over the Vancouver-based company. Analysts initially saw the offer as generous since exploration at Pierina was preliminary.
But Arequipa recently released a fresh batch of drill results from the property, attracting interest from other potential bidders.
On Aug. 16, Barrick raised its offer to C$30 a share to pre-empt a takeover battle.
More drill results were expected soon.
Hours after Barrick officials got the news that the takeover offer had succeeded, two top executives in charge of exploration left to take a closer look at their new treasure.
""They're on their way to Lima right now, to start work on Pierina,"" said company spokesman Vincent Borg. ""What's next is to get a handle on the ore body.""
Drilling on the property will continue at an accelerated pace, he said. Barrick also plans to send in additional drill rigs and prepare for engineering work leading up to an eventual feasibility study.
""Things will start kicking in,"" Borg said.
Analysts were also on their way to Vancouver to scrutinize data collected by Arequipa that Barrick has not yet seen.
Funding the takeover will not be a problem, Borg added. ""We've got a very strong balance sheet. We've got no long-term debt.""
But the company will have to pay interest on its line of credit and bump up its exploration budget to uncover the metal at Pierina, cutting into earnings, one analyst said.
The Arequipa acquisition was a very ""aggressive"" move for Barrick and signals the start of a bold, new expansion strategy for the gold giant, mining experts said.
""I don't think they'll stop here. I think they'll continue on the acquisition track,"" one said.
Barrick would not say if it had its eye on another property. But the company has said in the past it plans to make more than one acquisition.",0
"Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp is the most likely contender to partner junior mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd in developing its huge Indonesian gold deposit, analysts polled by Reuters said.
""We really only have one potential front runner: Barrick,"" said gold analyst Barry Allan with Gordon Capital.
Barrick has demonstrated its interest in Indonesian gold by investing more than US$10 million in exploration and amassing a large land position in Indonesia, analysts said.  
And Barrick's association with a construction company run by the daughter of Indonesia's President Suharto suggests Barrick is carefully setting up its network to control a piece or all of the Busang, Bre-X's 47-million-ounce discovery in the middle of the jungles of Borneo.
""They're trying to position themselves the best they can,"" said one analyst who did not want to be named.  
Analysts who have been closely watching developments around Busang,said Barrick stands the best chance of bidding successfully for a stake in the property because Barrick's own high-priced stock, relative to the value of its assets, will look attractive to Bre-X shareholders.
""In order to pay the sort of multiples Bre-X is trading at, you have to have a high gold multiple in order to land the company or the property at these prices,"" said Rick Cohen at Goepel Shields in Vancouver.  
Bre-X shareholders will likely look for a combination of cash and shares so they can keep a stake in the fortunes of Busang, analysts said.
Bre-X is looking for a heavyweight mining company to buy all or part of the Busang discovery and act as operator of what is expected to become one of the world's biggest gold mines. But the search has been dogged by a dispute with Bre-X's Indonesian partners over ownership.
The spat has caused the Indonesian government to delay granting Bre-X essential contracts of work needed to develop Busang. Without the contracts, analysts said a bid for Bre-X would be unlikely.  
Bre-X has refused to speak to the media since it forged an alliance with Indonesian President Suharto's son last week. But some analysts said Bre-X told them recently the dispute should be cleared up this month.
While Barrick is at the top of the list of companies who could afford to buy into Bre-X, Vancouver-based Placer Dome Inc also has the resources and the attractive stock price to make a bid, analyst Cohen pointed out.
""The size of this deposit and the potential involved here sort of limits it to those two,"" he said.
Others said the Bre-X play was not Placer Dome's style.  
""Definitely Placer has the capability to do it. I just don't think they have the stomach for it,"" said Allan.
Newmont Gold Co, RTZ Corp PLC, Minorco SA and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc could also be in the running for Bre-X. However, their chances are not as good as Barrick's, analysts said, noting that Newmont, Freeport and RTZ already have large exposure in Indonesia.  
While the Luxemburg-based Minorco, controlled by Anglo American Corp of South Africa  ANGL.J., has recently raised US$400 million, the company's stock lacks the high multiple that would make it attractive to Bre-X shareholders.
Minorco could run into political problems if it were to make a bid for Bre-X, said one South African analyst who follows Minorco closely.
""The South Africans might not want to get into a situation that's so blatantly political,"" he said. ""It might backfire on them.""  
If Barrick does eventually succeed in controlling the Busang deposit, it would go a long way to fulfilling Barrick chief executive Peter Munk's dream of building the world's largest gold company to supplant Anglo American, analysts said.
""It fits very nicely with Munk's strategy,"" said one analyst. ""Munk is not driven by money. He wants to have a legacy. He wants to be able to say he started with nothing and ended with the largest gold company in the world.",0
"Confusion whirled around Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd on Wednesday after Indonesia's mines minister said the government canceled parliamentary approval for Bre-X's application for essential contracts of work for the huge Busang gold deposit.
Bre-X asked that its stock be halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning so company officials could explain the news to the public, said Neil Winchester, head of surveillance at the Toronto exchange.
Trading in Bre-X was also halted on Nasdaq.
Bre-X had not yet released a statement late in Wednesday's trading session, leaving investors and analysts trying to assess the impact of the minister's statements on Bre-X's future.
""Does Bre-X lose everything? We have no idea,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac. ""It's very unclear. We have to sit tight and wait for news out of Jakarta. There are many options open to the government right now.""
Earlier on Wednesday, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Ida Bagus Sudjana spoke to reporters about Bre-X's application for vital contracts of work for Busang.
""We cancel it. The Bre-X contract of work will be processed from the beginning,"" he said.
The secretary-general of the ministry, Umar Said, told a parliamentary commission hearing that the government was checking into representations Bre-X had made to North American regulatory authorities.
""I don't have an answer on what it means,"" said Vince Borg, a spokesman for Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp .
Barrick has been negotiating with Bre-X to form a joint venture to operate Busang after the Indonesian government asked the two companies to work out a deal.
The move has irked Bre-X shareholders and other major gold companies wanting to bid on the 57 million-ounce deposit, but there were rumors on Wednesday that the Indonesian government may be considering an open bidding process.
""We need to clarify what this means,"" said Borg. ""We are seeking to asctertain from both Bre-X and the Indonesian Mines Ministry what impact the parliamentary committee will have on our negotations.""
Barrick, the world's third biggest gold producer, fell C$2.35 ($1.70) to C$38.90 ($28.55) on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday and by 1-7/8 to 28-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
A deal to control Busang would take Barrick a long way to achieving its goal of becoming the world's biggest gold producer.
Bre-X has a contract of work for the Busang I area of the property on the island of Borneo. But Busang I contains only an estimated 2.6 million ounces of gold, with the bulk of the precious metal in two adjoining lots, Busang II and Busang III, for which it needs contracts of work to explore and develop.
The permits were held up this autumn because of an ownership dispute between Bre-X and one of its Indonesian partners over the Busang property.",0
"Gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. is negotiating with Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. to gain control of Bre-X's huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, the two companies said on Tuesday.
The companies were negotiating under the ""guidance"" of the Indonesian government, which asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick, Bre-X said.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X discovered Busang, one of the world's biggest gold deposits, in 1994.
Official estimates of Busang have outlined 47 million ounces of gold so far, but analysts have said that number could rise to 100 million ounces.
""This is a result of Barrick working very hard behind the scenes to circumvent Bre-X's sale process,"" one analyst said of the news. Bre-X has been seeking a partnership with a major gold producer to operate Busang.
To satisfy Indonesia, Bre-X would keep 25 percent of its stake and 75 percent would go to Toronto-based Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer.
Bre-X said that the Indonesian government ""would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government.""
The Indonesian government wants Barrick and Bre-X to reach a deal by December 4 or else the government ""will take steps to prevent a delay in the development"" of Busang, Bre-X said.
Development of Busang has been held up by disputes between Bre-X and its Indonesian partners over ownership of the discovery.
Bre-X, which controls 90 percent of Busang, said it asked Indonesia's Mines Ministry if other deals would be acceptable, but had not yet received an answer.
A deal between the two companies was not a sure thing, Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview.
He said he had no details about how much money or stock would change hands or when a deal would be reached.
With the Indonesian government guiding the Busang negotiations, Bre-X's powers to negotiate a favorable deal were curbed, analysts said.
""There have been some constraints imposed on Bre-X,"" said mining analyst Chad Williams at Research Capital Corp. in Montreal. ""That's going to negatively impact on how much Bre-X can receive for its interest.""
But Barrick has an international reputation at stake and will have to be seen to treat Bre-X fairly, analysts said.
""Given the possible questions that may be raised over how Barrick obtained this special status, it will be essential that they are viewed as treating Bre-X shareholders fairly in any negotiations going forward,"" said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.
Barrick shares soared on the news, gaining C$2.30 to C$38.85 by mid-afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They rose 2-1/4 to 29-3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Bre-X shares fell in Toronto before the news and held steady in active trading at C$20.10, down C$2.45, after the market digested the news.
Its stock has been volatile lately, clouded by the ownership dispute over Busang.
Busang would set Barrick well on its way to achieving its dream of becoming the world's biggest gold company.
In 1995, the company -- already North America's largest -- produced 3.1 million ounces of gold and had gold reserves totaling 43.3 million ounces.
It has become increasingly aggressive in moving towards its goal, analysts said.
Last summer, Barrick acquired Arequipa Resources Ltd. and its promising Pierina gold property in Peru for about $800 million.",0
"The rights to Bre-X Minerals Ltd.'s huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia appeared to be up in the air Monday despite an Indonesian government statement declaring Canada's Barrick Gold Corp. the winner.
""We still don't have a deal. There are a number of points that are still being negotiated,"" Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty said in a phone interview. ""Negotiations are still ongoing.""
""I can explain to you that we don't have a signed agreement,"" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said.
The Indonesian government told Reuters in Jakarta Monday that the two companies had agreed to split the deposit, with Barrick getting 75 percent and Bre-X keeping 25 percent.
""They have reported they can both accept the government suggestion,"" of a 75-25 split, said Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines and Energy Ministry.
""They are also ready to provide a 10 percent stake to the government,"" he said. ""It is good.""
Last month, Indonesia asked Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick and announce a deal by Dec. 4. When the deadline passed, the two companies said they had reached agreement on some issues but that others were still outstanding.
""We are negotiating toward an end,"" McAnulty said Monday.
He said legal issues stood in the way of an agreement.
""The whole thing is totally confusing,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler of brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion in Toronto.
""I think these guys are close, but there are probably a few things in the way.""
The companies are wrangling over the Busang gold find, which holds at least 57 million ounces of low-cost gold on the island of Borneo.
Neither company would provide details about the terms of a deal, when the terms would be announced, whether shareholders would be able to vote on the agreement or who would be given essential contracts of work granting mining rights to the property.
Bre-X was still hoping the Indonesian government would drop its request for a deal with Barrick and let Bre-X find a partner through an open bidding process, McAnulty said.
""We're getting signals from the consulate, from the embassy, from Mr. Said,"" he said. ""We certainly hope the government allows the process to proceed as originally planned. It would be to the best interest of Bre-X shareholders.""
Vancouver, British Columbia-based gold firm Placer Dome Inc. has complained about being shut out of the process despite months of negotiations.
Placer Dome has said it wanted a chance to put forward a bid, but its status was in limbo as it awaited word from the Indonesian government.
Newmont Mining Corp., which had previously shown interest in Busang, said Monday it was preoccupied with a takeover bid for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp.
Bre-X closed down C10 cents (8 cents) to C$20.05 ($14.80), topping the list of most active stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Barrick fell C15 cents (11.7 cents) to C$40.05 ($29.67) in Toronto and by 12.5 cents to $29.375 on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Royal Oak Mines Inc is reshaping its operations to concentrate on its low-cost gold deposits in the Timmins area and British Columbia, the company president said Wednesday.
""We have refocused our strategy to bring on very low-cost production,"" Peggy Witte said in an analysts' conference call. ""It's very clear that's where Royal Oak's future lies.""  
The Kirkland, Washington-based gold producer said Wednesday it will close down its mine in Hope Brook, Newfoundland, and write down the reserves at its Colomac mine in the Northwest Territories.
Royal Oak expects to take C$37.4 million in charges because of the Hope Brook and Colomac decisions. After tax, the charges will amount to a decrease in net income of about C$27 million or C$0.19 a share in the fourth quarter of 1996.
The company plans to move most of the mining and mill assets from Hope Brook to its Matachewan project in northern Ontario.  
""It's a very positive story for us being able to redeploy those assets, and we did not want to spread our senior management too thin,"" Witte said, explaining the decision.
Hope Brook will shut down in the third quarter of 1997, while Matachewan is expected to start production in the second half of 1998, Royal Oak said.
The company recently increased its gold reserves at its Timmins and Matachewan properties, decided to expand its Pamour Mill and is putting together a feasibility study for an expanded open pit in the area.  
The northern Ontario mines, along with production expected in 1998 from the Kemess copper and gold mine in British Columbia, will boost production and decrease costs significantly for Royal Oak, said chief financial officer Jim Wood.
The company expects to produce 375,000 ounces at a cash costs of US$325 an ounce in 1997. In 1998, production will rise to 500,000 ounces at a cost of US$250 or US$260 an ounce. By 1999, the company expects up to 750,000 ounces at about US$240 an ounce, and in 2000, production should be almost one million ounces with costs in the low US$200s, Wood said.  
""Although we have closed out Hope Brook cash costs are somewhat disappointing at Colomac, the future of the company, with the Pamour expansion, looks very bright for us in terms of production and our average cash costs,"" he said.
The company reported third quarter profits of C$10.2 million or C$0.07 a share, up from C$6.2 million or C$0.05 a share a year earlier.
Gold production rose 13 percent in the quarter to 104,012 ounces from 92,159 ounces during the third quarter last year.
The increase came from the Pamour mine in Northern Ontario, which produced higher grade ore.  
Revenue was 48 percent higher in the third quarter, mainly because of a successful hedging program. The company realized a gold price of US$543 per ounce, compared to US$418 an ounce at the same time last year.
Royal Oak expects to produce about 400,000 ounces of gold in 1996 at a cash cost of US$335 an ounce. The lower production level and increase in cash cost from previous estimates are a result of lower grade ore at Colomac.",0
"The fate of one of the world's most glittering gold finds landed back in the hands of the Indonesian government on Monday after two Canadian mining concerns said they finally agreed on a plan of joint development.
Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp. and Bre-X Minerals Ltd. ended weeks of speculation on whether they could work together when they submitted a proposal to develop the huge Busang deposit, which contains at least 57 million ounces of gold.
""We've made a submission...which says we can work together if the government can satisfy requests by both parties on a couple of items,"" Bre-X chief executive officer David Walsh said in a phone interview from New York.
""Within the document, there were certain concerns that we've asked the government to give us guidance on,"" said Walsh. ""They are concerns from both parties.""
He would not say what the concerns were, but he said price was not an issue.
The Indonesian government told the two companies in November to form a joint venture, with Barrick gaining 75 percent and Bre-X keeping 25 percent. The two companies were also asked to give the government a 10 percent cut.
The joint submission ""is in accord with the government parameters,"" said Barrick spokesman Vince Borg. Neither company would say what the terms or structure of the proposed deal were or whether Bre-X shareholders would have a chance to vote on it.
They said a government response was expected in due course.
The government has twice extended a deadline for the two companies, with the latest extension being the end of December.
""This to me looks like they're doing what (Indonesian president) Suharto asked,"" said gold analyst Rick Cohen with Goepel Shields in Vancouver.
""There wasn't much else Bre-X could have done at this point.""
The government's statements have angered Bre-X shareholders and hurt the company's once high-flying stock on Canadian stock exchanges.
One group of shareholders has hired high profile Texas lawyers to make sure shareholders get a fair deal.
""Talk of lawsuits is premature. We've got to see an offer first,"" said Greg Chorny, a retired lawyer who lives near Toronto and is spearheading the initiative. ""We'll see what they have on the table, judge it and react appropriately.""
Until Monday, Bre-X had been optimistic that the Indonesian government would endorse an open bidding process for Busang. Mining giants Placer Dome Inc., Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. have expressed interest.
But the statements from Barrick and Bre-X on Monday suggested there was little hope of an auction process, analysts said.
""We still remain hopeful,"" Placer Dome spokesman Hugh Leggatt said. ""It's not over till it's over.""
Investors appeared to be dumping Bre-X shares on Monday and picking up Barrick shares to participate in Busang, analysts said.
Barrick stock was up C$1.35 to C$40.15 while Bre-X fell C$1 to C$20 by late afternoon trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.",0
"Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd., moved on Monday to resolve a dispute over its huge Busang gold discovery in Indonesia, forging an alliance with a company controlled by the eldest son of Indonesia's President Suharto.
""This is an important first step to the resolution of Bre-X's problems,"" said gold analyst John Ing of Maison Placements Canada.
The stock jumped C$3.50 to C$24.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, topping actives on more than 6.4 million shares. On Nasdaq, Bre-X rose $2.625 to $18.25.
Bre-X said it will pay $40 million for a deal with PT Panutan Duta, part of the Panutan group run by Sigit Harjojudanto, Suharto's eldest son.
Analysts said the alliance with Panutan Duta, part of the Panutan group involved in energy, mining and telecommunications, should help Bre-X clear up a widely publicised dispute over the ownership of its glittering Busang gold discovery.
Bre-X stock has taken a beating in recent weeks because of the dispute.
One of Bre-X's Indonesian partners, Jusuf Merukh, is seeking a 40 percent stake in Busang, which has estimated gold reserves of 47 million ounces.
The Indonesian government has said it will delay issuing the crucial contracts of work to Bre-X until the dispute is resolved. Without the contracts, Bre-X cannot advance its work on the Busang deposit.
The dispute has also clouded Bre-X's quest to find a major mining partner to develop and operate Busang.
Panutan will receive a 10 percent interest in the richest parts of the Busang gold deposit on the island of Kalimantan, Bre-X said.
In return, Panutan will act as a consultant for Bre-X in Indonesia and help the Calgary, Alberta-based company deal with administrative and technical matters. The deal is conditional on Bre-X's receiving essential permits from the Indonesian government.
""Having an arrangement with this fellow is a bonus,"" said Ing, the analyst. ""The key in Indonesia is who you know.""
""They seemed to have teamed up with a partner with high standing,"" said mining analyst Michael Fowler of brokerage Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion.
""This should clear up most of the (ownership) claims that are out there.""
Merukh told Reuters in Jakarta on Monday that he was optimistic a deal would be reached in November.
But Bre-X's hold on the Busang discovery is shrinking as it works out its problems, said Ing.
He said Bre-X will probably have to give away another slice of the deposit to Merukh and his Australian supporters, Golden Valley Mines NL.
""Slowly and salami-like, Bre-X is getting cut back,"" said Ing.
Officials at Bre-X did not return phone calls to discuss details of the alliance.",0
"North America's largest gold producer, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp, reported lower third-quarter earnings on Tuesday due to an after-tax charge and higher operating costs.
Barrick's net income for the quarter fell to $21 million, or 6 cents a share, from $67.7 million, or 19 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations.
""I think their quarter clearly underscores that Barrick has made the transition from a growth company to one that's trying to maintain its existing base,"" said mining analyst Barry Allan of Gordon Capital.
Barrick pointed to higher cash costs, which rose to $203 an ounce from $194 an ounce a year earlier.
The company also took a $38 million hit to bail out of its Cerro Corona exploration project in Peru.
Barrick hiked its exploration budget more than 50 percent, to $46.4 million for the first nine months of the year, compared with $30.9 million previously.
Investors seemed to shrug that off. Barrick's shares rose C50 cents to C$36.15 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the stock rose 37.5 cents to $26.875.
The market seemed positive to Barrick's plans to develop its Pascua mine in Chile and its new Pierina property in Peru, analysts said.
Barrick bought the Pierina deposit last summer through its $800 million takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, based on a minimum of 4.5 million ounces of gold. According to the company, recent drilling on the property suggests the number was conservative.
Barrick said production at Pierina should begin in late 1999 at a rate of 500,000 ounces of gold a year. Costs should be below $100 an ounce thanks to a substantial silver credit and high grade gold.
Capital costs should be about $200 million, the company said. It has eight drills on the property working to define the deposit.
""They are proceeding very aggressively on Pierina,"" Allan said. However, he cautioned that it was risky to make such claims while drilling was still underway and a feasibility study is still a long way off.
At Pascua in Chile, recent exploration suggests the deposit may extend across the nearby border into Argentina, Barrick said. Production is expected to begin in 1999, totalling 400,000 ounces a year at an operating cost of $240 per ounce. Capital costs are expected of about $475 million.",0
"Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. are trying to forge an alliance to mine the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia despite a cloud of uncertainty over the rights to the find, Bre-X's chief executive said Thursday.
But the negotiations with Barrick are progressing slowly, Bre-X Chief Executive Officer David Walsh told Reuters.
""We're moving ahead, albeit at a snail's pace,"" he said, adding that legal issues stood in the way of a full agreement. ""We're trying to get them to appreciate our views and the legal stance that we've taken.""
Last month the Indonesian government advised Bre-X to form a joint venture with Toronto-based Barrick to operate Busang. The government, which also requested a 10 percent stake, set a Dec. 4 deadline, but the two companies announced after that date that several issues remained outstanding.
Since then, the Indonesian government has raised doubts about Bre-X's grip on Busang, estimated to contain at least 57 million ounces of gold, worth about $21 billion at today's prices.
""The government has stopped processing the previous application for contracts of work by Bre-X because of various problems,"" Umar Said, Indonesia's secretary-general of mines, told Reuters in Jakarta on Thursday. ""Therefore the previous application by Bre-X that has been delayed must be stopped and must be said to have been cancelled.""
He said Bre-X and Barrick must jointly submit new applications for work on the deposit. Without contracts of work granted by the Indonesian government, Bre-X cannot proceed to exploit the find.
Walsh defended his company, saying its permits and applications for the gold property were ""in good standing.""
He said two Bre-X officials met with Umar in Jakarta Thursday and were assured everything was in line. ""The telephone call that I got from Rolie (Francisco), he was quite pleased with the meeting. He said we're making very good progress in our relationship (with the mines ministry),"" Walsh said.
Bre-X spokesman Steve McAnulty, explaining the apparent contradiction, said: ""What the government wants to do in essence is that if an agreement with Barrick is made, the existing applications will be replaced with new applications.""
Bre-X earlier said that Umar had apologised for the misunderstanding, saying his comments were ""erroneously reported in a Dec. 11 Reuters newswire article."" But Peter Thomas, a Reuter spokesman in London, said the international news and information company was confident the quotations in its Dec. 11 story from Jakarta were accurate.
Umar's comments to Reuters Thursday were essentially repeating what he said on Wednesday.
Despite a barrage of statements from Bre-X on Thursday, Barrick was still seeking clarification on the situation from the Indonesian government.
""We're still seeking clarification and we want to hear directly from the government of Indonesia,"" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in Toronto. ""We're not saying anything until we talk directly to the government of Indonesia.""
Bre-X, too, is waiting for the Indonesian government to make a move.
Walsh said he still had high hopes that Indonesian President Suharto would open up an auction for Busang, allowing other mining companies to bid on the project. He said Bre-X had not made a formal request for an auction, but added: ""We understand that the president is reviewing the situation.""
An auction would be advantageous for Bre-X shareholders and for Indonesia, he said. ""We're not soliciting offers. We are getting other phone calls,"" Walsh said. ""I am talking to principals of other companies.""
He said he had spoken to executives at Placer Dome Inc., Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp.
In Vancouver, Placer Dome spokesman Hugh Leggatt said any suggestion of an open auction on Busang was encouraging. His company has made a formal request for an open bidding process.
But gold mining analyst Bill Belovay of CIBC Wood Gundy said Barrick's competitors may be trying to make a deal with Bre-X more expensive for Barrick. ""They're playing games,"" he said. ""One has got to read between the lines.""
Belovay said Busang was so fraught with uncertainty that he has a hard time understanding why the major gold producers would be interested. ""One doesn't even know what percentage (Barrick) will end up with. One doesn't even know how to keep Suharto happy,"" he said. ""To me it's a whole big nightmare.""
Investors were confused by Thursday's developments, analysts said.
Bre-X, whose stock was halted all day on Wednesday, fell 85 cents to C$19.80 in heavy trading of more than 8.6 million shares. Barrick, which lost C$2.75 on Wednesday, regained C$1 to C$39.50 in trading of more than 2 million shares.",0
"Investors were on edge on Wednesday, anxiously awaiting the outcome of talks between Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. aimed at forging a deal on Indonesia's huge Busang gold deposit.
As a Dec. 4 deadline slid by, Bre-X and Barrick said they were still trying to work out several issues, leaving the market to speculate about the status of negotiations.
""Several points remain outstanding,"" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said. ""An overall deal has not been reached.""
The Indonesian government directed Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick by Dec. 4, with Barrick getting 75 percent of Bre-X's stake in the rich gold discovery and Bre-X keeping 25 percent. The companies were asked to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent in the rich find.
As the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry.
In Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.
""If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action ... to expedite the development of Busang's resouces,"" Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.
""What the action will be ... I have to get back to the government. This is not my playground,"" he added.
Meanwhile, investors pushed up Bre-X's stock by C$1.40 to C$20.10 ($14.90) in heavy trading in Toronto Wednesday, while Barrick rose C$1.10 to C$38.95 ($28.85).
""People think there's an agreement that will come out sooner rather than later,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital in Toronto.
But she noted that the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations was preventing Bre-X's stock from rising to meet the level of rumoured offers of C$25 ($18.50) a share from Barrick.
""We're actually hearing that (the deal) is done and they're just dotting the i's and crossing the t's,"" Gignac said. ""Everything has been set. We just don't know the details.""
But a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.
The latest deadline, if passed, would be the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.
Possible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X's claims, analysts said.
Waiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.
""I don't think today's deadline had any great significance,"" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to partner with Bre-X to develop Busang.
""We're not discouraged. It's going to be a long process,"" he said.
Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. also expressed an interest in Busang, which is located deep in the jungle in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.",0
"Falling gold prices have recently drained much of the life from the Toronto Stock Exchange's key gold index and analysts say the bloodletting may not be over.
""Gold stocks are still reflecting a $380 gold price, but look at the price now,"" said gold analyst Mike Jalonen at brokerage Midland Walwyn in Toronto. ""It's awful.""
""I think people are writing the obituary for the Toronto gold index,"" said Vahid Fathi, a mining analyst at Everen Securities in Chicago. ""They've been slaughtered.""
The Comex February gold price has slid steadily since Dec. 30 to $355.70 an ounce on Wednesday from $370.90. Gold was up slightly in London on Thursday at $356.60.
Gold prices have slumped to three-year lows on a strong U.S. dollar, booming financial markets, low inflation, rising mine production and rumors of central bank selling.
Most analysts said the yellow metal was headed further south, but there was no consensus on the extent of the decline or when prices might recover.
The heavily weighted gold index in Toronto, Canada's biggest stock market, has dropped with the price of the metal, losing more than nine percent since Dec. 30.
Canada's biggest gold companies, Barrick Gold Corp. and Placer Dome Inc. have followed suit.
Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer, closed at C$35.55 on Wednesday, down from C$39.50 on Dec. 30. The stock rose slightly on Thursday to C$35.75. In New York, Barrick has fallen to 26-3/8 from 28-7/8 on Dec. 30.
Vancouver-based Placer Dome fell to a 52-week low of C$27.05 on Wednesday from C$30.90 on Dec. 30. It was up C$0.30 to C$27.35 on Thursday. In New York, Placer fell to 20-1/4 on Thursday from 22-5/8 on Dec. 30.
U.S. gold producers have also been hit. Newmont Mining Corp. was trading at 40 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, versus 45-1/4 on Dec. 30. Homestake Mining Co. was at 13 5/8 on Thursday in New York, down from 14-1/4 on Dec. 30.
Traditionally, Toronto gold stocks move up in tandem with the gold price, but do not react as strongly to a price decline.
Discoveries, takeover rumors and news from exploration companies that share the Toronto gold index with major producers generally temper the index's reaction to price slumps.
That is not the case now.
""At this point in time, the market is not even paying attention to special situations,"" said Fathi.
On Wednesday, almost every stock in the Toronto gold index fell except for diamond companies.
Midland Walwyn's Jalonen predicted Toronto golds would lose a further five percent before they stabilized.
Diversified producers such as Vancouver-based Teck Corp. were not as vulnerable as pure gold producers to steep drops in the gold price, Jalonen noted.",0
"Bre-X Minerals Ltd's hold on the huge Busang gold deposit in Indonesia remained unclear Thursday after a string of statements from the company defending its rights to the find.
Calgary, Alberta-based Bre-X issued three news releases in as many hours early on Thursday about its grasp on Busang, worth at least $21 billion at today's gold prices and one of the world's biggest gold deposits.
Bre-X said its exploration permits and applications for contracts of work on Busang remained in good standing.
""Obviously significant progress is being made on all fronts toward the development of the Busang deposit,"" Bre-X Chief Executive David Walsh said in a statement issued from Jakarta.
Bre-X said its officials had met with Umar Said, Indonesia's secretary general of the Ministry of Mines, to clarify its status with Busang.
The company said Umar apologised for comments relating to the cancellation of permits and contract of work applications for Busang.
""The exploration permits and CoW applications for Busang II and Busang III remain in good standing,"" Bre-X said. Busang II contains most of the gold found so far on the property.
But earlier on Thursday, Umar repeated his comments to Reuters in Jakarta casting Bre-X's status in doubt.
Indonesian mining officials told Reuters in Jakarta that they had stopped processing Bre-X's applications for vital contracts of work on the gold find. Instead, Bre-X and Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp. must jointly submit new applications for the permits.
""The government has stopped processing the previous application for contracts of work by Bre-X because of various problems,"" Umar said. ""Therefore, the previous application by Bre-X that has been delayed must be stopped and must be said to have been cancelled.""
While mining officials were explaining their position in Jakarta, Bre-X was issuing optimistic statements.
Bre-X said it appeared that the development of Busang was ""possibly open to negotiation"" and that draft documents showed it had exclusive operating rights to Busang.
The Indonesian government encouraged Bre-X in November to form a joint venture with Barrick, with Barrick getting 75 percent of the joint venture, Bre-X keeping 25 percent and the two companies granting the Indonesian government a 10 percent stake.
But Bre-X said on Thursday that ""the government of Indonesia appears to be seriously reconsidering its earlier decision that would have compelled Bre-X into a partnership with Barrick.""
Bre-X cited a published report that suggested Indonesian President Suharto was ready to intervene in the process.
Bre-X and Barrick said last week they reached agreement on some points to form a joint venture for Busang, but outstanding issues remained and no overall agreement had been settled.
But Bre-X was still hopeful on Thursday that the negotiations for Busang could be opened up to an auction process.
""We have believed from the outset that the best interests of the Indonesian people and their economy would best be served by a truly open negotiation process for the development of this extraordinary natural resource,"" Walsh said in a letter to Indonesia's Minister of Mines.
Bre-X shares were still halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company requested a halt on Wednesday so it could clarify statements from Jakarta. The stock closed Tuesday at C$20.50.",0
"North America's largest gold producer, Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp, reported lower third-quarter earnings on Tuesday due to an after-tax charge and higher operating costs.
""I think their quarter clearly underscores that Barrick has made the transition from a growth company to one that's trying to maintain its existing base,"" said mining analyst Barry Allan of Gordon Capital.  
Barrick's net income for the quarter fell to US$21 million, or US$0.06 a share, from US$67.7 million, or US$0.19 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
Earnings were slightly below analysts' expectations.
Barrick pointed to higher cash costs, which rose to US$203 an ounce from US$194 an ounce a year earlier.
The company also took a US$38 million hit to bail out of its Cerro Corona exploration project in Peru.
And Barrick hiked its exploration budget more than 50 percent, to US$46.4 million for the first nine months of the year, compared to US$30.9 million previously.  
Investors seemed to shrug that off. Barrick's shares rose C$0.50 to C$36.15 in heavy trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the stock rose 3/8 to US$26 7/8.
The market seemed positive to Barrick's plans to develop its Pascua mine in Chile and its new Pierina property in Peru, analysts said.
Barrick bought the Pierina deposit last summer through its US$800 million takeover of Arequipa Resources Ltd, based on a minimum of 4.5 million ounces of gold. According to the company, recent drilling on the property suggests the number was conservative.  
Barrick said production at Pierina should begin in late 1999 at a rate of 500,000 ounces of gold a year. Costs should be below US$100 an ounce thanks to a substantial silver credit and high grade gold.
Capital costs should be about US$200 million, the company said. It has eight drills on the property working to define the deposit.
""They are proceeding very aggressively on Pierina,"" analyst Allan said. However, he cautioned that it was risky to make such claims while drilling was still underway and a feasibility study is still a long way off.
At Pascua in Chile, recent exploration suggests the deposit may extend across the nearby border into Argentina, Barrick said. Production is expected to begin in 1999, totaling 400,000 ounces a year at an operating cost of US$240 per ounce. Capital costs are expected of about US$475 million.",0
"Canadian mining company Bre-X Minerals Ltd has been in hiding since it announced 17 days ago that it has formed a partnership with the son of Indonesian ruler Suharto, prompting a flurry of comment on its ethics. (Corrects description of Suharto.)
Despite a constant whirl of rumors and persistent questions that have sent the company's shares on a roller coaster ride, Bre-X is maintaining a dogged silence. 
The Calgary-based company that controls one of the world's biggest gold prospects in Indonesia has not talked to the financial press for weeks. Company officials will take calls only from a handful of favoured analysts, according to market sources.
""I haven't had any calls returned,"" said gold analyst Rick Cohen with Goepel Shields in Vancouver. ""There seems to be a certain number of people they talk to. Everybody's a bit in the dark."" 
Bre-X sent out a news release on October 28 about its alliance Suharto's son, Sigit Harjojudanto, whose business influence is pervasive in Indonesia.
Since then, instead of directly addressing material questions about its business in Indonesia -- many of which are playing havoc with its stock price -- Bre-X has opted instead to leak to the market carefully selected press material.
On Sunday, for example, the company faxed the media, analysts and shareholders a copy of a story from the Far Eastern Economic Review detailing its links with Sigit. 
The article referred to Sigit's possible ties with the Indonesian army, stated flatly that one of Bre-X's Indonesian partners has been bought out and asserted that Canadian gold giant Barrick Gold Corp had tried to push Bre-X into a bad deal.
Despite questions about the article, Bre-X refused to respond and still has not said whether it endorses the story or puts any faith in the statements contained in the story.
""I've certainly suggested a few times that they talk to the media and clear things up,"" said Neil Winchester, manager of surveillance at the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
""It would be advantageous to the marketplace,"" he added.
Rumors have surrounded Bre-X since the Indonesian government said last month it would not issue essential contracts of work until Bre-X cleared up an ownership dispute with some of its Indonesian partners.
The dispute has placed a cloud over Bre-X's search to find a major mining partner to help it develop the rich Busang gold deposit in East Kalimantan, but the alliance with Suharto's son was expected to help the company clear up its problems. 
""They're optimistic that they can get everything (the permits) within a couple of weeks,"" said gold analyst Michael Fowler of Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, who said he spoke with Bre-X on Tuesday.
But he said Bre-X would not comment on the article it distributed. ""They just sent it out for general interest purposes,"" he added.
Still, the rumors in the article and other rampant gossip are taking a toll on shares linked to Bre-X. Other exploration companies in Asia have complained the uncertainty has spilled over and hurt their stocks. 
Minorca Resources Inc, a Canadian junior mining company that has an interest in the Busang deposit through an alliance with Bre-X's Indonesian partner, PT Askatindo Karya Mineral, has found itself on the defensive.
Talk about Askatindo being bought out is unfounded, Minorca president Roland Horst said in an interview. ""They have no intention to sell out,"" he said.
Minorca's chairman is in Indonesia this week meeting with Askatindo officials and verified the company's intentions.
""There were discussions, but they were rebuffed,"" said Horst. 
He added that he also had a slew of unanswered questions about Bre-X's arrangements with Suharto's son.
""To be frank, the relationship between Minorca and Bre-X is relatively cool.""",0

"Major mining companies may have second thoughts about teaming up with Bre-X Minerals Ltd in its huge Indonesian gold discovery because of Bre-X's new strategic alliance, analysts said.
Bre-X announced this week an alliance with PT Panutan Duta, an Indonesian company controlled by Sigit Harjojudanto, the son of President Suharto.
Part of the deal forms a support services company to be owned 60 percent by the Bre-X group and 40 percent by Panutan.  
""There will be certain companies that look at this and shake their heads,"" said mining analyst Doug Leishman of Yorkton Securities.
The support services company will provide utilities, petroleum products and limestone for the Busang gold discovery on the island of Kalimantan, Bre-X said.
The new company could have control over major parts of operating and capital costs, said Leishman.
""If these things aren't done at normal world market prices, it could add on unwarranted capital and operating costs,"" he said in a telephone interview from Vancouver.  
Any major mining company considering a bid for Bre-X would have to take into account the potential extra costs and the loss of control over supplies that the new alliance brings, he said.
Bre-X is in the middle of a search for a major mining company to act as its partner to help develop the Busang discovery.
""Certain major companies will not like this. It ties them to a supplier, and no one likes that,"" Leishman said.  
Canadian gold giants Barrick Gold Corp and Placer Dome Inc, both said they needed more details about the supply company before they could judge whether it would be a factor in bidding for Busang.
""Does this change things? Unless you know the details of the agreements, you don't know if this changes things or not,"" Barrick spokesman Vince Borg said in an interview. ""It could and it could not.""
Bre-X would not return repeated telephone calls this week to ask for details of the Panutan agreement.  
Analyst Catherine Gignac at Deacon Capital Corp said the agreement is vital to Bre-X's progress.
""I think it's something they should have done two years ago,"" she said in an interview. ""You need a local company that's on side. You need local connections.""
Bre-X stock shot up C$3.50 to C$24.30 on Monday after the alliance was announced, but has slid back to C$22.40 since then as investors began to realize that the Panutan deal does not solve all Bre-X's problems, analysts said.
Bre-X has been plagued by a dispute over the ownership of Busang. One of its Indonesian partners is claiming up to 40 percent of the discovery and has said he will not back down despite Bre-X's alliance with Suharto's son.
The Indonesian government has vowed not to issue essential contracts of work until Bre-X sorts out its problems. The alliance with Panutan is also contingent on Bre-X receiving the permits.",0
"No final deal was in sight Wednesday for Bre-X Minerals Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp., which are in the midst of forging a deal on one of the world's biggest gold deposits -- Indonesia's Busang.
As a Wednesday deadline slid by, Bre-X and Barrick said they were still trying to hammer out several issues, leaving the market to speculate about the status of negotiations.
A few issues remain to be solved, and Bre-X will have more news on the negotiations ""shortly,"" Chief Executive David Walsh said in an interview from New York.
He said the main issues that stand in the way of a full agreement with Barrick are ""regulatory"" but maintained he was prevented by a confidentiality agreement to give details.
""We need certain additional comfort in any agreement that would satisfy the regulatory authorities and our shareholders,"" he said.
The Indonesian government directed Bre-X to form a joint venture with Barrick by Dec. 4, with Barrick getting 75 percent of Bre-X's stake in the rich gold discovery and Bre-X keeping 25 percent. The companies were invited to consider giving the Indonesian government 10 percent of the rich find.
As the clocked ticked, Bre-X issued a statement saying no new deadline had been set by the Indonesian Mines Ministry. It said it expected the Ministry of Mines to clarify its stand on the outstanding issues ""in due course.""
The direction of negotiations is in the hands of the Indonesian government, Walsh said.
""We are waiting on the answers we get from the Minister of Mines,"" he said.
Sources close to the talks said Indonesian mining officials had left Jakarta and would not be back until Dec. 9.
""I think both sides are probably worried about the so-called deadline, which has come and gone,"" said gold analyst John Ing with Maison Placements Canada Inc. ""It's back in the lap of the Indonesians.""
In Jakarta, a senior Indonesian mines official said the government of President Suharto would explore other possibilities to develop Busang if the two companies fail to clinch a deal.
""If they cannot reach an agreement, the government will take the necessary and appropriate action ... to expedite the development of Busang's resouces,"" Umar Said, secretary-general of the Mines Department, told a news conference in Jakarta.
""What the action will be ... I have to get back to the government. This is not my playground,"" he added.
Meanwhile, investors pushed up Bre-X's stock C$1.30 to close at C$20.10 ($14.84) in heavy trading in Toronto Wednesday, while Barrick rose C$1.45 to C$39.30 ($29.01).
""People think there's an agreement that will come out sooner rather than later,"" said gold analyst Catherine Gignac of Deacon Capital in Toronto.
But she noted that the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations was preventing Bre-X's stock from rising to meet the level of rumoured offers of about C$25 ($18.50) a share from Barrick.
""We're actually hearing that (the deal) is done and they're just dotting the i's and crossing the t's,"" Gignac said. ""Everything has been set. We just don't know the details.""
But a source close to the negotiations said he understood that the two companies did not have a deal and were trying to get a deadline extension from the Indonesian government.
The latest deadline is the second the two companies missed. They let a deadline at the end of November slip by too, sources said.
Possible stumbling blocks in the talks include price, how to pay for the deal and a series of threatened lawsuits over Bre-X's claims, analysts said.
Waiting to pounce on the deposit if the Indonesian government does open the door to outside bidding is another North American gold giant -- Placer Dome Inc., which seemed to be positioning itself in case the Barrick, Bre-X talks fail.
""I don't think today's deadline had any great significance,"" Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said in Vancouver, British Columbia. He added that the company still hoped to be allowed to form a partnership with Bre-X to develop Busang.
""We're not discouraged. It's going to be a long process,"" he said.
Newmont Mining Corp. and Teck Corp. also expressed an interest in Busang, which is located deep in the jungle in East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo.",0
"Inco Ltd's huge nickel, copper and cobalt property at Voisey's Bay in remote Labrador keeps getting bigger, with 11 drill rigs working around the clock to define three enormous deposits that promise to upset the world's metals markets.  
""There are a couple hundred million tonnes for sure, close to proven,"" said Greg Soper, a drill manager for Archean Resources, which has an exploration contract until the end of the year at the Northern site on a sub-Arctic land mass that is closer to Greenland than to much of the rest of Canada.
""This here is a world class deposit. Every week we're hitting stuff,"" said Soper, waving his arm to point at the vast stretch of bog and thin forest surrounding the round, rocky hill where metals were discovered two years ago.  
Inco's most recent calculations, compiled in an internal report at the end of August, showed 138 million tonnes of resource (corrects from ""proven or probable reserves"") spread out over three different deposits at the Voisey's Bay property. Resources are potential reserves.
On average, the deposits graded 2.09 percent nickel, 1.24 percent copper and 0.99 percent cobalt, the report said.
At the Ovoid deposit, found close to the surface of a bog close to the Labrador Sea, drilling has outlined 37.5 million tonnes. Exploration is finished at the Ovoid and Inco now plans to mine the area through an open pit mine.  
The Eastern Deeps, which lies under a series of hills covered with sparse trees and lush moss, has not yet been defined.
Recent calculations showed 75.5 million tonnes of ore, but the deposit was open in all directions.
To the west of the Ovoid, in the Western Extension, drills are uncovering another rich deposit. The mineralization was uncovered last April, after Diamond Fields Resources Inc, the owner of Voisey's Bay, accepted Inco's C$4.3 billion takeover offer.  
So far, drilling has defined 24.7 million tonnes, but the deposit is growing steadily.
Both the Eastern Deeps and the Western Extension need extremely deep holes to strike significant metal, and each major hole takes about three weeks to drill, said Soper.
More than 340 holes have been completed so far, with a total drilling meterage of more than 135,000 metres, Inco said in its recent mine and mill project description.
""Over half of our holes are good. They're mineralized,"" said 25-year-old geologist Mary Vaughan as she examined a new box of core samples just brought in from the Eastern Deeps.  
""It just blows you away. It's an explorationist's dream.""
Archean Resources plans to keep drilling at a breakneck pace until its contract ends in December.
Inco has not said whether it will extend Archean's contract, but the Toronto-based company has promised to spend C$20 million over the next four years on exploration.
Only five percent of the property has been explored so far, but small exploration companies that have claims surrounding Inco's 495-square-kilometre site have not found anything significant.  
New resource calculations are expected within the next month, Rick Gill, spokesman for Inco subsidiary Voisey's Bay Nickel Co told Reuters in St. John's, Newfoundland.
Mining at Voisey's Bay is expected to last at least 20 years, with a concentrator on site handling 15,000 tonnes of ore a day. Mining will likely continue all year round, despite high winds, extremely cold temperatures and thick ice that locks in the site for a few months every winter.
""The information that we have at this time suggests it will be possible to operate year 'round with ice breaker support,"" said Gill.",0
"Canadian nickel giant Falconbridge Ltd has a growing appetite for expansion and is poised for growth through acquisition and exploration, the company's new chief executive officer said in an interview.
""The appetite of this company is much higher than what it used to be,"" Oyvind Hushovd told Reuters on Wednesday. ""Falconbridge is in very good shape financially today, which means that we have the ability to grow.""
Hushovd, 46, replaced Frank Pickard as chief executive this month after Pickard died suddenly at the age of 63 during a business trip in Chile this September.
Hushovd, originally from Norway, has worked for Falconbridge for more than 22 years.
He spent the past year and a half working closely with Pickard in the position of executive vice-president and was chairman of the steering committee that put together a strategic plan to carry Falconbridge into the next century.
""I don't see a need to revolutionize Falconbridge,"" he said. ""The backbone of Falconbridge is nickel, and copper is another leg of Falconbridge. It will probably be like that in the future.""
However, Hushovd is not content simply to sit back and let the long-term strategic plan unfold.
The plan calls for Falconbridge to double its annual nickel production to 200,000 tonnes and triple its copper production to about 500,000 tonnes a year, within 15 years.
To do that, Falconbridge needs to find growth opportunities, especially since the company lost a bid to take over the huge Voisey's Bay nickel, copper and cobalt deposit in remote Labrador, said Hushovd.
Ongoing work in New Caledonia, Ivory Coast and Zambia should complement plans to start producing nickel by the end of next year at the Raglan project in Quebec and plans to produce copper by 1998 at the Collahuasi joint venture project in Chile, Hushovd said.
In Zambia, Falconbridge joined a consortium in November to develop the Konkola Deep copper mine, in which Falconbridge is partners with South Africa's Gencor Ltd and Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd.
In New Caledonia in the South Pacific, Falconbridge is poised to gain access to nickel reserves to supply a nickel plant planned in the north of the country. The board of France's Eramet on Thursday said it had agreed to reallocate its mining reserves in New Caledonia, which would give Falconbridge access to Eramet's Koniambo field.
Hushovd does not intend not stop there.
""Falconbridge has always been very strong in exploration,"" he said. ""We felt we lacked the business development infrastructure.""
So last summer, the company set up a business development group, to search out growth opportunities either through exploration or acquisition.
While Hushovd would not hint at specific acquisition targets, he stressed, ""I want properties that are not only profitable today but are also profitable in the future.""
In any future acquisitions, Falconbridge can probably count on support from its powerful majority shareholder, Noranda Inc, which owns 46 percent.
""We have a big owner, which means that hopefully we can pursue things that might be tough to pursue on our own,"" Hushovd said. ""We can have a bigger appetite than the company on its own would have.""
Hushovd said he had no immediate plans to boost the company's share price, which peaked at C$32.75 in May but is currently trading around C$29.15.
He noted that the stock normally reflects the nickel price, which has failed to meet expectations in 1996.
""I think we all had very high hopes for nickel this year, and the market did not turn out the way that we had forecasted,"" he said.
As for next year, ""I feel it's difficult to give a prediction at the present time. Fundamentally I do believe we're going to see better prices in 97 than we did in 96,"" Hushovd said.",0
"A long-delayed Japanese mission to discuss the details of Tokyo's huge state loans to China has reached basic agreement on 22 development projects proposed by Beijing, Japanese officials said on Thursday.
Projects involving infrastructure, agriculture and environmental protection were likely to be among the recipients of favourable Japanese loans, said Shiro Sadoshima, director of the loan aid division of Japan's Foreign Ministry.
Final decisions had yet to be made on the 22 projects slated to receive the 180 billion yen ($1.6 billion) earmarked for the first year of the yen loan package, which will run from 1996 to 2000, Sadoshima told a news briefing.
Japanese sources in Beijing say discussions on the projects had been long delayed because of faltering relations and Japanese anger at China's nuclear testing that last year led to the freezing of Japanese grant-in-aid.
The 580 billion yen in Japanese soft loans due to be extended to China between 1996 to 2000 were not formally affected by the protest, but no missions to approve their details had been sent since China conducted a nuclear test in May 1995.
Asked if Chinese nuclear testing was a factor in Tokyo's delay in sending the loan mission, Sadoshima said that did not appear to be the case.
""At least, our government has never said that,"" he said, adding it was incorrect to say work on the loans had been ""resumed"" -- a word used by other Japanese officials.
""It's not a resumption... We never stopped,"" he said.
Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been strained this year by a controversial visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to a shrine to Japan's war dead and by a territorial dispute over an island group in the East China Sea.
While Chinese state media have been quick to condemn what they call resurgent Japanese militarism, diplomats say Beijing is keen not to allow the disputes to harm an economic relationship in which the soft yen loans are an important part.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai earlier this week warned Japan not to use financial assistance as a form of political pressure, saying to do so could only harm ties.
The yen loans, widely seen in China as a form of reparation for the suffering inflicted by Japan during World War Two, have themselves been a source of dispute.
The rise of the value of the yen in 1994 and 1995 -- which sent the cost of the loans soaring -- prompted howls of Chinese complaints and demands to be allowed to repay in U.S. dollars.
Tokyo refused, but the yen's later decline helped blunt the issue as a potential cause of conflict and both sides have recently shown new willingness to cooperate on other issues.
Prime Minister Hashimoto has been reported as promising to consider lifting the freeze on grant-in-aid to China, but Sadoshima said that issue would not be discussed by the loan mission.
""That's not my department,"" Sadoshima said.

"The head of China's restive northwestern Xinjiang on Friday accused western nations of working with pro-independence activists to try to split the nation, saying no end was in sight in the war on separatism.
Activists in the mainly-Moslem district had fomented riots and carried out political killings, but their struggle against Beijing rule was bound to fail, chairman of the Xinjiang autonomous region, Ablait Abdureschit, told reporters here.
""Against the strategic background of some people internationally engaging in splitting and westernising China, there is a small clique who want to split Xinjiang from China and achieve independence,"" he said.
""To achieve their objectives they take all kinds of actions; they infiltrate, make propaganda, carry out assassinations and create riots,"" he said.
""The vast majority of Xinjiang people resolutely oppose such activities,"" he said, adding western conspiracies to divide China could never succeed.
Separatists stood against the economic progress that Beijing was bringing to a region where development had long lagged behind other areas of China, he said, accusing un-named western nations of conspiring with pro-independence activists.
""In the last few years some western countries have concentrated on engaging in activities to westernise and split China,"" he said. ""...In Xinjiang, the separatists have cooperated with the international conspiracy to westernise and split China.""
Authorities in Xinjiang this year intensified a crackdown on separatists and unauthorised religious activity after a series of violent clashes, bombings and assassinations of officials and Islamic leaders regarded as pro-Beijing.
The arid region, described by officials as a sunny ""Land of Fruit and Melons"", is considered by many Chinese a wild frontier province and has a long history of ethnic unrest between the native Uighur population and members of China's Han majority.
In May, Beijing ordered tighter controls along Xinjiang's long borders to block the smuggling of weapons and subversive materials from nearby central Asian states.
Ablait Abdureschit said only a few people were involved in separatist activities in the region, but acknowledged the struggle against separatism was unlikely to end soon.
""Nationalist separatist activities occurred in the past, occur now, and will occur in the future, abroad and also within the country,"" he said. ""This struggle is long-term and complicated.""
Despite the struggle against separatism, the outlook was bright for the sprawling region, which borders Afghanistan, Pakistan and three mainly-Moslem central Asian states from the former Soviet Union, Ablait Abdureschit said.
Beijing, which provided more than 40 percent of the region's government budget, was working hard to boost the economy and improve Xinjiang's links with the outside world, he said.
The resource-rich region was aiming to become one of the country's top grain producers by the end of the century and had already gathered a record cotton harvest of 1.05 million tonnes in 1996, while oil and gas resources were abundant, he said.
""The general situation in Xinjiang is good,"" he said.",0
"An estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people in China are infected with the HIV virus but many Chinese still know little about the deadly AIDS disease it can cause, health officials said on Wednesday.
China was at a critical stage in its fight against AIDS, but a campaign launched by Beijing's communist leadership to promote ""spiritual civilisation"" -- or puritan Marxism values -- would help cut the cases caused by unsafe sex and drug use, the Xinhua news agency said.
Officials said they also planned to strengthen publicity to promote condom use.
China's official total for the number of people infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remained around 3,400.-- up from 3,341 at the end of 1995.
But tens of thousands of other cases went uncounted, a Ministry of Public Health official said.
Experts estimated the actual number of HIV infections at between 50,000 and 100,000 people, she told Reuters by telephone.
China was continuing to clamp down on drug abuse, strengthen controls on blood for medical transfusions and boost anti-AIDS education and was currently holding a three-day national meeting on the disease in Beijing, another ministry official said.
Officials would launch a series of activities in December to promote awareness and knowledge of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), he said.
""Many people do not even know how AIDS is transmitted,"" he said in a telephone interview.
The HIV virus is transmitted through direct contact with the body fluids of an infected person and can be spread through sexual contact, transfusions of infected blood or the use of dirty needles by drug addicts.
AIDS would not spread rapidly in China, although infection by all these routes was already occurring, the official Xinhua news agency quoted Professor Dai Zhicheng, vice president of the National Aids Committee, as saying.
""AIDS is spreading very fast in some neighbouring countries of China, and it is being transmitted through every possible method in our country,"" Dai said.
""China is at a critical point in its AIDS control, but some new measures will be adopted to slow down the spread of the disease,"" he said.
Xinhua said the official count of people infected with HIV was expected to approach 5,000 by the end of 1996, but doctors have warned widespread misdiagnosis amd insufficient reporting mean the real total may have long since passed 100,000.
Officials planned to set up a national AIDS control centre and improve monitoring networks. Regulations or laws on blood administration would also be published, Dai said.
Beijing's campaign to promote ethical progress, regarded by analysts as a bid to bolster the authority of the ruling Communist Party and boost socialist values weakened by economic reforms, would help in China's fight against AIDS, Dai said.
Overseas experience had shown that condoms were an effective way to prevent AIDS and China had launched an experimental campaign to promote condom use in Shanghai in 1994, said the health ministry official.
""The result was not very good,"" he said. ""Many people feel willing to use condoms if they are free... but not if they are sold.""",0
"A Chinese court took less than four hours on Wednesday to convict prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan of plotting to overthrow the government and sentenced him to 11 years in prison.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court found Wang guilty of conspiring to subvert the Chinese government, the Xinhua news agency said. He faced a maximum penalty of death.
""Sufficient evidence, which includes written materials, witness accounts, recorded tape and criminal technical appraisal, were shown at the court,"" Xinhua quoted the judge as saying after the trial.
Wang, 27, was also deprived of his political rights for two years, Xinhua said, quoting the verdict.
""Wang candidly confessed his activities,"" Xinhua said, adding that he received funds from overseas hostile forces, gave financial aid to families of jailed dissidents and tried to set up an ""opposition force"" by uniting illegal organisations.
Charges against Wang were backed by testimony by another dissident, Liu Xiaobo, Xinhua said. It did not elaborate. Liu was sent this month to a labour camp for three years.
""His criminal fact is clear, and the evidence is conclusive,"" Xinhua said quoting the verdict against Wang. ""He instigated people by saying that 'It is time we turn our words into actions'.""
The verdict was issued just four hours after the trial began. Foreign reporters and legal experts were barred from attending the trial in western Beijing.
Security was tight around the court building, with dozens of police preventing the public from approaching the building.
Earlier on Wednesday, the dissident's father said the family would appeal if Wang were convicted.
""We will definitely appeal... We will not give in,"" Wang Xianzeng told reporters just hours before the start of the proceedings.
""He is definitely innocent,"" he said as he left his home with the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun, to go to the court.
""Speech can't overthrow the government,"" he said.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, attended the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister were allowed to sit in.
Wang Lingyun said on Tuesday she expected Wang to receive a harsh sentence although he would plead not guilty.
The mother had said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated since he vanished into detention in May 1995.
Wang Dan faced a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.",0
"China's economy grew by 9.6 percent in the first nine months of 1996, but many urban family incomes are lagging behind, the State Statistical Bureau said Wednesday.
Chinese industrial output was up, farmers were on their way to a year of record grain harvests and the scourge of inflation had been tamed to a year-on-year 6.6 percent in the first three quarters, bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.
""The development of the macro-economy overall appears good,"" Ye told a news conference.
Gross domestic product was 4.5675 trillion yuan ($550.3 billion) between January and September, up 9.6 percent from the same period of 1995, Ye said, but gave no details. China's GDP grew by 10.2 percent in 1995.
The average urban income rose to 3,249 yuan ($391) between January and September, an actual year-on-year increase of 3.4 percent, he said.
But the incomes of many urban residents are lagging behind as China's economy booms, Ye said.
A survey of 35 major cities and towns had revealed that the incomes per family member of around 40 percent of households had declined, he said.
Some of the decline was the ordinary result of the birth of children or the retirement of older family members, he said.
""The second kind of situation is when the level of income falls or the level of income growth cannot keep up with inflation,"" Ye said, adding such problems were the cause of the income fall in about half the families surveyed.
""The difficulties of some low-income urban families have been aggravated,"" he said.
He gave no explanation of the decline in incomes suffered by some urban wage-earners, but many surplus workers in China's huge and largely stagnant state sector have been sent home on minimum salaries.
Although such workers are not considered unemployed and the state sector is highly reluctant to fire employees, China's urban unemployment rate hit 2.98 percent at the end of September, Ye said.
The number of unemployed in Chinese cities reached 5.3 million, he said, but gave no comparative figures.
China's urban jobless rate was 2.9 percent by the end of June, the same as the official figure for 1995, but state newspapers have warned that unemployment, a major concern for Beijing's communist leadership, could shoot up to 7.4 percent by 2000.
Optimism over the economy and the success of a continuing policy of tight credit aimed at curbing inflation and reining in runaway growth has been boosted by predictions that 1996 will be a bumper year for China's hundreds of millions of farmers.
Government policies had encouraged farmers to increase the area of land under grain, and grain output this year was forecast to exceed 480 million metric tons, beating the 1995 record harvest by about 15 million tons, Ye said.
China had set a target of 465 million tons for 1996.
Other figures released by the Statistical Bureau also painted a positive picture of an economy that Beijing says is on target for a ""soft landing"" after years of breakneck growth.
Year-on-year retail price inflation in the first three quarters was curbed to 6.6 percent, down 10 percentage points compared with the same period of 1995, Ye said.
The Xinhua news agency on Wednesday quoted economic tsar Zhu Rongji as forecasting inflation would be below 6.5 percent in 1996 and as saying it would be possible to cut it to six percent next year.

"China has ordered two Hong Kong democracy activists to leave the country after they tried to petition Beijing officials over the political future of the colony, Hong Kong sources and Chinese media said on Friday.
Beijing police had told activists Wong Chung-ki and Chui Pak-tai to leave China, the official Xinhua news agency said.
Hong Kong sources said the two had been trying to petition officials over what they called the ""undemocratic"" methods being used by China to select a chief executive to run the British colony after it reverts to Beijing rule on July 1, 1997.
""The Beijing Public Security Department issued a warning to Chui and Wong, asking them to return (to) Hong Kong within a stated time,"" Xinhua said.
It was not clear if the two campaigners, both members of local councils in the British colony, had already left Beijing.
Officials of a Beijing hotel had filed a public disturbance complaint against the two for distributing materials to reporters in the hotel on Thursday evening, Xinhua said.
Anxiety has grown in Hong Kong in recent months over how much political freedom China will allow after it regains control of a colony run from London for more than 150 years.
The jailing of leading Chinese dissident Wang Dan for 11 years by a Beijing court on Wednesday awakened fears that those who criticised the post-handover, Beijing-backed administration could face a similar fate.
Chinese authorities, currently overseeing the selection of a group to choose Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive, also barred two other pro-democracy advocates from entering the country on Thursday, activists in Hong Kong said.
Officials at the Sha Tau Kok border post refused entry to Andrew To and Chan Kwok-leung of the Hong Kong Democratic Party after keeping them in a room for two hours, To told Reuters.
All four activists had planned to lobby the China-selected Preparatory Committee that will select the committee to decide the chief executive, and to appeal for a reprieve of Hong Kong's current elected legislature, which Beijing has vowed to scrap.
A copy of a statement by the activists obtained by Reuters accused China of using undemocratic methods to choose the chief executive and condemned the decision to bar their colleagues from entering the country.
Their petition urged Beijing to scrap a plan to appoint a provisional legislature in place of the elected Legislative Council, and demanded the territory's future leader be elected instead of chosen by a China-controlled selection committee.
China, which has bitterly opposed democratic reforms introduced in Hong Kong in recent years, says the official Selection Committee will be well equipped to represent the will of the colony's six million people.
The rules for choosing the chief executive would guarantee a selection that was fair, honest and without corruption, Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen told Preparatory Committee members in a speech on Friday.
Analysts said a list of candidates for the Selection Committee released on Friday was dominated by pro-China politicians. The Preparatory Committee was scheduled to vote on the list on Saturday.
China has agreed to retain Hong Kong's capitalist system for 50 years but officials have suggested that freedom of expression in the bustling colony would be limited after the transfer.
A survey published on Thursday said most businessmen in Hong Kong expected press freedom, the political system and human rights to deteriorate after the return to Chinese rule.",0
"Motorola Inc is appealing to Chinese authorities over taxes on capital imports that would boost the cost of a $500 million semiconductor plant being built in the city of Tianjin, a company official said on Friday.
Construction of the plant in Xiqing district, a half an hour's drive from the northern port city's centre, was on schedule and production was expected to begin in the first quarter of 1998, said the official, who declined to be identified.
The U.S. high-technology giant was appealing to China's State Council, or cabinet, over taxes on imports of vital equipment for the semiconductor plant, or fab, he said.
Beijing on April 1 abolished privileges for foreign-funded ventures that had allowed them to import machinery and other capital equipment free of tax. Investors say the move has dramatically increased the cost of many projects.
""There is an appeal committee within the State Council and we are appealing for some tax exemption (for the Xiqing plant),"" the Motorola official said.
He declined to say if the company was optimistic of being granted exemptions, or when a decision was expected.  
An official of the State Council's information office contacted by telephone said he was unaware of an appeal by Motorola over taxes on imports, adding that such matters were the concern of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
Work on the Xiqing project had already begun, the Motorola official said.
""We have already broken ground...Now we are erecting the buildings,"" he said. ""We are looking at 1998, first quarter (to begin production).""
Initial investment in the venture was expected to be around $500 million, but the cost of such semiconductor plants could easily rise to $1.0 billion, he said but gave no details.
Motorola has been quoted as saying the Xiqing plant will produce 180,000 eight-inch sub-micron wafers a year, making it a major addition to a Chinese semiconductor industry that has long lagged far behind its Asian neighbours.
Motorola, which has vowed to invest $1.2 billion in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong between 1988 and 2000, generated sales revenues in China and Hong Kong of $3.2 billion last year, the official said.  
The company's China plants were considered strategic investments, he said, adding that the local content rate of their products was expected to rise to around 55 percent by 2000 from around 45 percent currently.
Motorola's exports from its China operations accounted for about 30 percent of production value, less than expected because of the breakneck expansion of the domestic market, he said.
""The market here, especially the telecom market, just exploded,"" he said.
State media has quoted Motorola executives as saying the number of Chinese using pagers is likely to rise by around 43 percent this year to more than 40 million people, making China the biggest user of pagers in the world.
Motorola currently supplies more than 50 percent of the domestic pager market, the official said, but declined to give details.",0
"China issued a spirited defence of embattled U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Friday, accusing the United States of trying to use financial blackmail to stop him from serving a second term.
Boutros-Ghali had helped push forward world development during his five-year term as U.N. chief and his re-election should have been assured, said the People's Daily newspaper, official mouthpiece of China's communist leadership.
The United States should reconsider its lonely stance as the only nation on the U.N.'s 15-member Security Council to oppose the Egyptian's re-election, the newspaper said.
Washington on Tuesday vetoed Boutros-Ghali's candidacy, accusing him of being too slow in pushing U.N. reform and saying his candidacy would further delay U.S. payment of $1.4 billion in membership dues owed to the world body.
""Lumping together Boutros-Ghali's reappointment and the payment of membership dues can only make people feel that someone is trying to blackmail the United Nations,"" People's Daily said in a signed editorial.
All U.N. members, whatever their internal politics, were responsible for paying dues and U.S. opposition to Boutros-Ghali was unjustified, it said in the latest of a series of Chinese affirmations of support for the U.N. chief.
""The United States has absolutely not raised any decent grounds for opposing Boutros-Ghali's renewal, but has just criticised him for being weak on U.N. reform,"" it said.
""You just have to respect facts to be able to see that this kind of criticism of inadequacy is not persuasive.""
Boutros-Ghali's opposition to U.S. attempts to use the United Nations as a cover for policies of hegemony and power politics was a key factor behind Washington's opposition to his re-election, said the Yangcheng Daily newspaper.
The U.S. Republican-dominated Congress is delaying payment of the $1.4 billion U.S. debt to the United Nations, a policy helping to bankrupt the cash-strapped world body.
People's Daily said Boutros-Ghali had worked to push U.N. reform, had paid great attention to the cause of world development and had made a special contribution to development in Africa during his tenure, which ends on December 31.
Diplomats say African nations are currently driving the campaign for Boutros-Ghali's re-election, aiming to keep his candidacy alive as long as possible in the hope of a compromise solution or a change in the U.S. stance.
Boutros-Ghali said on Thursday that he did not wish to see his name submitted to the Security Council for another vote but also that he was not withdrawing from the race.
Washington's reluctance to propose alternatives to Boutros-Ghali was a sign of U.S. insecurity and its knowledge that any candidate it chose would be rejected by other nations, the People's Daily said.
""If the African nations continue to support Boutros-Ghali, the United States will face a difficult decision,"" it said.
""Many people hope the United States that cast the opposing vote will consider its position anew and solve this problem in an appropriate way.",0
"China on Thursday said it was willing to cooperate with other countries to maintain peace on the troubled Korean peninsula, where tensions are high as South Korean troops hunt for infiltrators from the rival North.
""We are paying great attention to the situation on the Korean peninsula,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a briefing in Beijing.
""China is willing to cooperate with other countries to bring into play positive and constructive action to uphold the peninsula's peace and stability,"" Shen said.
Frosty relations between Seoul and Pyongyang worsened last month when 26 North Koreans landed in the south from a stranded submarine.
Southern troops have since killed or found dead 22 of the infiltrators, have captured one and are carrying out a huge hunt for the remaining three.
Pyongyang has threatened ""merciless retaliation"" for the deaths of its soldiers and demanded Seoul return the submarine along with any survivors and bodies of the dead crew.
Seoul says any provocation will meet ""stern punishment"" and has raised security at airports, ports, diplomatic missions and five vulnerable west coast islands.
China backed the north in the 1950-53 Korean War and remains one of communist Pyongyang's few diplomatic allies, but also considers Seoul an important trading partner.
Shen gave no details of what kind of cooperation China hoped would bolster peace on the heavily-militarised peninsula, where southern forces face a hostile north suffering near-famine after disastrous floods.
South Korea and the United States in April called for four-nation peace talks with the north and China to replace a truce that ended the Korean conflict but left Seoul and Pyongyang technically still at war.
Pyongyang has insisted on bilateral talks with Washington to seek an accord, saying Seoul was not a party to the 1953 truce. China has yet to take a clear stance on the four-way talks.
Beijing had no private interest in the Korean peninsula and only wanted peace and stability, Shen said.
Both North and South should take action to ensure peace, he said but gave no details.",0
"A huge ethylene venture linking a British Petroleum subsidiary and Shanghai Petrochemical Co Ltd would give BP a major presence in China's downstream petrochemicals, company officials said on Tuesday.
BP Chemicals signed a letter of intent with Shanghai Petrochemical on Thursday to set up a $2.5 billion plant in Shanghai capable of producing 650,000 tonnes of ethylene a year.
""It's a big step forward for our development in China,"" said Zhang Jianning, BP's Beijing manager of government affairs.
He said BP's biggest China project so far also marked a change of focus for the company, which has until recently concentrated most of its Chinese investment in upstream activities such as drilling and exploration.
Analysts have predicted huge growth in China's downstream petrochemicals industry, as booming economic growth sends demand for products such as ethylene soaring.
""At the moment I would think petrochemicals is getting quite exciting,"" Zhang said in a telephone interview.
Officials of Shanghai Petrochemical, which is majority-owned by China Petrochemical Corp, or Sinopec, said the huge project demonstrated the company's confidence in its own future and in China's economic development.
It was too early to say how long a feasibility study for the project would take, but for a project of such a scale preliminary research could reasonably last up to two years, said Shanghai Petrochemical deputy director Lian Xiaolu.
Completion of such projects could take up to eight years, Lian told a news briefing in Beijing, adding it was too early to decide the details of how the venture would operate or of the investment required.
BP will own a 50 percent stake in the ethylene plant with the remaining 50 percent either held by Shanghai Petrochemical or shared with its parent Sinopec, officials said.
The venture is one of six ethylene projects with annual capacity of 600,000 tonnes or more promoted by state planners, the official China Daily said.
Sinopec president Sheng Huaren said last week the state oil refiner planned to more than double ethylene production capacity to around five million tonnes a year by 2000 from the current annual 2.36 million tonnes.
Shanghai Petrochemical officials said they hoped to establish a joint venture company with BP to produce acrylonitrile, used to make synthetic fibres.
The joint venture could then be expanded if all went well with technical studies for the ethylene plant, they said.
""If the market is there we will go ahead very quickly on this one,"" BP's Zhang said. He declined to say when the British firm hoped to begin production.
While the letter of intent showed a major commitment to working with BP, even if the ethylene project developed it did not mean Shanghai Petrochemical would slow cooperation with other foreign firms, said board of directors secretary Cai Hongping.
""It's not like love with a marriage of one husband and one wife,"" he said. ""I think Shanghai Petrochemical will not stop looking for other partners.""",0
"China's power minister vowed Thursday to protect the interests of foreign investors expected to provide one-fifth of the 700 billion yuan ($84 billion) to be invested in power generation between 1996 and 2000.
Foreign investment in the electricity generation sector would be carefully channelled to boost China's domestic industry, power minister Shi Dazhen told a business conference.
""We have established a legal framework to protect foreign investors,"" Shi told reporters at the conference.
Beijing would perfect its laws and regulations to ensure that investor interests were guaranteed, he said.
China's electricity generating capacity would hit 290,000 megawatts by the end of 2000 from 217,000 megawatts at the end of 1995, Shi said.
China would require around 700 billion yuan ($84.4 million) investment in the power sector during Beijing's state-set ninth five-year plan, which runs from 1996-2000, he said.
Foreign investors were expected to come up with 20 percent -- around $17 billion -- while the central government provided 40 percent and local authorities and enterprises shelled out the remaining 40 percent, he said but gave no details.
The investment estimates appeared to be lower than those made by other senior power officials last month, who said China would need $20 billion from abroad.
Shi said he was unaware of the $20 billion figure.
Potential foreign investors have said an effective 15 percent limit on returns on investment from Chinese power plant projects is a major disincentive, but Shi waved aside such concerns, saying any specific limit would be impractical.
Chinese energy officials have consistently denied setting any limit on returns, although they have said the best rate from key projects is around 17 percent.
Chinese electricity prices are fixed by the state, which has kept prices low.
Shi said foreign investors remained keen to put their money behind Chinese efforts to build enough generating capacity to keep up with rocketing economic growth and to raise per capita capacity from the meagre 180 watts achieved by the end of 1995.
""Although the power industry has developed very quickly, because China has a population of 1.2 billion, the power supply is still very tight and the supply level is very low,"" he said.
""There is great enthusiasm among foreigners to invest in this sector,"" he said, adding that such investment should be carefully guided.
""The use of foreign investment must be combined with that of China's own power manufacturing industry, with foreign funds used to buy Chinese-made generating equipment,"" he said.
Foreign funds would be focused on high technology plants with capacity of 300 megawatts or more, he said.
Beijing says it wants to replace inefficient thermal power stations that burn dirty high-sulphur coal with larger new plants and with nuclear and hydro-electric projects.",0
"Some of the brightest stars of Chinese pop put on a glittering show in Beijing on Friday, but officials kept politically-suspect rock heroes off the playlist, sources close to the concert said.
A capacity audience of around 18,000 flocked to the Capital Gymnasium to see a showcase event featuring dozens of performers from China's fledgling popular music industry.
State media said the event, the first leg of a double concert in the capital, was intended to celebrate the growth of the pop music industry since it was banned as capitalist poison during the chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
The concerts were intended to capture the flavour of the past decade of Chinese pop, but organisers had been ordered to cut some of the nation's biggest and most influential rock and roll stars from the playlist, sources close to the event said.
The Friday 'A' concert, to be followed by a 'B' performance on Saturday, was a showcase mainly for sugary pop songs largely focused on themes of love and friendship --  a staple diet for state-run music broadcasters.
Harder-edged music -- unpopular among communist authorities keen to promote safe socialist loyalties -- was conspiciously absent.
Beijing has repeatedly ordered campaigns to boost socialist morality weakened in the rush to a market economy, prompting tighter official controls on all forms of cultural activity.
Cui Jian, widely regarded as the father of Chinese rock music, was not scheduled to attend either concert, organisers said.
Sources close to the event said Cui, whose music is a blend of Western rock, Chinese instruments and politically-sensitive lyrics, had originally been intended to play a major part in the event but had been barred by China's musical mandarins.
The classically-trained performer's music is still hugely popular among listeners, but ideologically-suspect anthems such as ""Nothing to My Name' that caught the mood of a generation in the late 1980s are seldom permitted on state-controlled media.
""Cui's basically been banned from performing in Beijing since 1993,"" said a promoter close to the event who declined to be named. ""The higher-ups told the organisers...he couldn't take part.""
Heavy rock group Hei Bao, or Black Panther, which has won the hearts of many younger Chinese despite official disapproval, would also be absent, said concert promoter and radio presenter Zhang Shurong.
Zhang said he had not been told of any ban against Cui or Hei Bao, who have long been forced to seek venues far from the Chinese capital.
Hei Bao had not been banned but were considered unsuitable because they could make the audience too excited, he said, adding the stars still on the playlist were attraction enough.
""They are all very important, all people who can play epoch-making roles in the circle of Chinese singers,"" he said.",0
"The goodwill generated by recent high-level visits may warm a Sino-U.S. presidential meeting this weekend, but lingering disputes mean the two leaders will still have much to talk about, diplomats and analysts said on Friday.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's meeting with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton at a conference of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in the Philippines would be a key chance to bolster recent progress in easing ties, they said.
A visit this week by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher had brought Beijing welcome signs of new U.S. flexibility on such thorny issues as weapons proliferation, trade and Taiwan, said a Chinese specialist on U.S. affairs.
""During Christopher's visit to China there was progress on all the issues,"" said Niu Jun of the North American foreign policy department of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Both sides had acknowledged a need to boost contacts and exchange state visits, while Christopher had accepted that U.S. arms sales to Beijing's island rival Taiwan were a weapons proliferation issue, Niu said in a telephone interview.
The clearest sign of Washington's desire to repair the battered cross-Pacific relationship was U.S. willingness to consider starting peaceful nuclear cooperation even before a previously signed accord on the issue was implemented, he said.
""This change (on nuclear technology transfer) symbolised the change in the U.S. attitude,"" he said.
""There has to be a belief in the possibility of establishing fairly good relations with China in the future (for the United States to be willing) to transfer this kind of advanced technology,"" he said.
China is eager to buy nuclear reactors from U.S. firms equally keen to tap into its potentially large market, but cooperation has been stunted by U.S. fears that Beijing places few controls on the proliferation of nuclear technology.
While nuclear flexibility is controversial in Washington, mutual interest made nuclear cooperation the issue one that Washington and Beijing could use to ensure a recent improvement in ties did not falter, said a Beijing-based Western diplomat.
""I think that's the big carrot the Americans are trying to hold out for more progress on non-proliferation,"" the diplomat said. ""It's something the Americans would quite like to do anyway because there's money in it.""
While Christopher's visit had helped to boost ties in general, China was still likely to hold out for unilateral concessions from Washington on the terms of its accession to the World Trade Organisation, human rights and trade, he said.
""They don't really seem to have made a lot of progress,"" he said. ""I get the impression that there's still a lot of hard pounding to go.""
A U.S. desire to see more concrete commitments from Beijing before making concessions meant that the Jiang-Clinton meeting could end up achieving little of real substance, he said.
Taiwan, which Beijing has considered a rebel province since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, would remain China's main policy focus at the presidential meeting, said Niu.
""For China the most important issue is Taiwan...and the reaffirmation that (the United States) will not sell weapons to Taiwan,"" he said.
While China's stance on most Sino-U.S. bugbear issues was clear, Beijing was unlikely to give any public signal of its intentions on newer issues such as a U.S. push for tax-free imformation technology imports or other APEC proposals, the Western diplomat said.
""I think the Chinese are keeping their powder dry on all these issues,"" he said.",0
"A Beijing court on Wednesday sentenced dissident and former student leader Wang Dan to 11 years in prison, the latest hammer-blow struck by China against its tiny band of pro-democracy activists.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours to convict Wang of plotting to subvert the government, but the young dissident's family quickly denounced the verdict and vowed to appeal.
""We are angry... He received such a heavy sentence even though he was innocent,"" Wang's father, Wang Xianzeng, said in a telephone interview after a brief meeting with his son at a Beijing detention centre.
""Wang Dan said he wants to appeal,"" he said. ""Wang Dan feels everything that he has done has been above-board... it was all for China's democratisation.""
Wang, 27, was sentenced to 11 years in prison and deprived of his political rights for a further two years, the Xinhua news agency said in a long report hailing the fairness of the trial.
""Sufficient evidence, which includes written materials, witness accounts, recorded tape and criminal technical appraisal, were shown at the court,"" the official agency quoted the trial's chief judge as saying.
""The evidence is conclusive,"" it quoted the verdict as saying. ""(Wang) instigated people by saying that 'It is time we turn our words into actions'.""
Wang, who vanished into detention in May 1995, had faced a maximum penalty of death and a minimum 10-year prison term.
One of the student leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing that were crushed by the army, Wang had been one of the few members of China's dwindling band of dissidents not in exile or serving a long term in detention or prison.
A spate of arrests and detentions in recent months has left the pro-democracy movement reeling, analysts say.
Wang's conviction was a slap in the face for Western governments that have appealed to Beijing to improve its human rights record, diplomats in the Chinese capital said.
New York-based rights group Human Rights in China denounced the verdict as the result of a show trial that blatantly violated Chinese law and international standards.
Scores of police enforced tight security around the court building in western Beijing, keeping foreign journalists well away from a trial billed by officials as open to the public.
Less than 20 observers had been allowed in the court, said Wang's father, who was allowed to attend along with the dissident's older sister.
""Not one witness was summoned,"" he said. ""The judge did not uphold the justice and dignity of the law... How can writing articles constitute a crime?""
The family would have 10 days to appeal upon receiving official notification of the verdict in about five days' time, he said, adding they were not optimistic the verdict would be overturned.
The 11-year sentence had been no surprise to the family or to Wang, who had been in good spirits during their 30-minute meeting after the trial, said his mother, a 61-year-old museum researcher who attended as one of two defence lawyers.
Wang, who once promoted free debate in the campus of the elite Beijing University, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations.
He returned to political activism after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to Beijing's communist leadership for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
Wang's father said his son's health had deteriorated during more than 15 months in detention, but added the former student activist believed he had done nothing to be ashamed of.
""He has a clear conscience,"" he said.",0
"Authorities in central China's Anhui province have ordered three pro-democracy activists to stand trial on charges of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, a human rights group said on Monday.
The Hefei Intermediate People's Court in the Anhui capital was scheduled to try dissidents Shen Liangqing, Ma Lianggang and Huang Xiuming on Tuesday, New York-based watchdog Human Rights in China said in a statement.
A court official in Hefei contacted by telephone declined to comment on the case, saying questions related to it touched on matters that had ""not been made public"".
The group said the trial would be the latest step in a state crackdown on dissent that has seen many of the main figures in China's struggling pro-democracy movement disappear into prison or administrative detention.
There was little doubt about the likely result of the trial of Shen, Ma and Huang, all of whom had been detained at least once since they took part in an ill-fated campaign for more democracy in 1989, the U.S. group said.
""Although they must go for trial on (November) 26th, it has already been decided that they are guilty and must be punished,"" it said.
All were unemployed, though Shen had been a government official and Huang a manager at a company. Ma had been a student.
The evidence against the three stemmed from articles written and distributed in 1991, and for which all had already been detained for more than a year, the human rights group said.
""To suddenly try them again now is a typical case in the Chinese government's strict nationwide suppression of dissidents,"" it said.
Earlier this month, a Beijing court took just 10 minutes to reject the appeal of leading dissident Wang Dan and uphold his 11-year prison sentence for subversion.
The trial and failed appeal of the former student leader were part of a series of crushing blows delivered by authorities to China's tiny band of political dissenters.
Visiting U.S. and European officials and politicians have raised the case of jailed dissidents in talks with Chinese leaders, but have said individual human rights cases should not be allowed to disrupt overall ties.
China dismisses criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.
Human Rights in Asia said observers were being denied access to the trial of the three Anhui dissidents, although the proceedings were officially open.
""It is believed this is another trial in which society and the free media are not permitted to understand the real situation,"" the group said.
The intermediate court official said he could not confirm any details of the case.
""We cannot answer over the phone, because this concerns a matter that has not been made public,"" the official said.",0
"China said on Thursday its jailing of leading dissident Wang Dan for 11 years was not a human rights issue but an ordinary legal matter that would not hurt Beijing's sensitive relationship with the United States.
A Chinese court on Wednesday took less than four hours to condemn former student leader Wang for plotting against the government, in a verdict that prompted quick expressions of deep concern from Washington.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said the trial would not cause further damage to cross-Pacific ties, long sorely tested by disputes over Beijing's human rights record.
""The case of Wang Dan has nothing to do with the issue of human rights,"" Shen told a news briefing. ""I don't think the case of Wang Dan will have any effect on Sino-U.S. relations.""
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court sentenced Wang, 27, to 11 years in prison and stripped him of his political rights for a further two years, after a brief hearing hailed by state media as a model of fairness.
International human right activists rushed to condemn the trial as a sham and the verdict as a travesty, while Wang's family said justice had not been served and vowed to appeal.
""Wang Dan's trial was a parody of justice,"" rights watchdog Amnesty International said in a statement. ""It is clear that the verdict and sentence against him had been decided in advance.""
Foreign reporters had been barred from the trial and the speed with which the official Xinhua news agency released a lengthy interview with the chief judge afterwards showed the report had been prepared in advance, Amnesty said.
Police posted outside Wang Dan's home in western Beijing blocked reporters from meeting his family, who plan to appeal as soon as they receive official notification of the verdict.
Two policemen had visited the family on Tuesday morning and others continued to keep constant watch, said the dissident's mother Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old museum researcher who attended his trial as one of two defence lawyers.
""Wherever I go, they go,"" she said by telephone.
European governments expressed dismay at the severity of the sentence imposed on a dissident renowned abroad for his role as a leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army.
Wang, who once promoted free debate on the campus of Beijing University, had already served four years in prison for his role in the 1989 protests. He returned to political activism after his release, before vanishing into detention in May 1995.
Washington officials greeted the verdict against Wang with expressions of concern and high praise for the young dissident, hailing him as one of China's premier voices for human rights.
""We are deeply concerned by the sentence that has been given to Wang Dan,"" White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
""We urge the Chinese authorities to show clemency to this courageous man, whose championing of democratic values has gained him deserved international recognition,"" said U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
Chinese spokesman Shen said Wang's conviction was purely a domestic legal affair.
""The trial of Wang Dan is entirely a Chinese legal procedure carried out in accordance with the law,"" he said. ""It has no connection with human rights or other issues.""
Sino-U.S. ties have long been strained by disputes over human rights, trade, copyright theft in China and Taiwan, but both sides say tensions have eased in recent months after a series of high-level meetings.",0
"China's soaring demand for computer chips is expected to fuel strong growth in a domestic semiconductor industry that has long lagged behind its Asian neighbours, industry and government officials said on Monday.
Beijing hoped to boost the output of advanced integrated circuits (ICs), despite complaints that import tariffs and U.S. technology export restrictions made some vital equipment difficult to obtain, they said.
""In recent years the industry has grown fast,"" said Yu Zhongyu, chief engineer of the Ministry of Electronics Industry. ""In the next five years it will grow even faster.""
Chip production had been identified by Beijing as the first priority of the electronics industry, Yu told Reuters at an industry conference in the Chinese capital.
Demand for ICs would continue to be pushed by China's growing hunger for consumer electronics and telecommunications, with personal computers expected to become a major future source of demand, he said.
The value of China's IC output soared to $550 million in 1995 from $400 million the year before, but production was just one-fifth of demand, said industry group Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI).
China was expected to produce 700 million chips a year by 2000, up from 330 million in 1995, SEMI officials said.
The value of equipment imports for the plants needed to make chips was expected to soar to about $700 million in 1997 from an estimated $500 million this year, they said.
China was pulling itself out of a semiconductor swamp created by its attempts during the 1980s to set up small-scale producers around the country, said an official of one U.S. company that supplies semiconductor production equipment.
Beijing was now promoting larger, more advanced fabs, or IC plants, that could match international standards, said the official, who declined to be identified.
""They have made up their mind that they are going to go for it...and believe me, the market is big,"" he said.
Yu said Beijing had decided to build 0.5 micron ICs at the Huahong Microelectronics Ltd in Shanghai as part of moves to develop China's ability to make sophisticated small chips.
Other sub-micron plants were being built or expanded in cooperation with foreign firms, such as Mitsubishi Stone IC Co, a joint venture between China's Stone Group and Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsui & Co Ltd of Japan, he said.
The $1.6 billion Mitsubishi Stone venture was announced in March, with a $100 million 0.35 micron IC fab to be launched next year.
South Korean chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co, which opened a $100 million semiconducter plant in the eastern province of Jiangsu in July, has said it expects the Chinese market to grow an average annual 26 percent until 1999.
Difficulties in importing production equipment were a major obstacle to China's creation of a semiconductor industry that could compete with neighbouring powerhouses such as South Korea and Japan, industry analysts at the conference said.
""China's increased import tariffs and U.S. restrictions on technology exports are the biggest problems,"" said one analyst. ""Companies say they can't bring in the equipment they need.""",0
"European record business executives on Friday sang the praises of China's crackdown on widespread copyright piracy, saying Beijing appeared sincere in its desire to build a legitimate music industry.
European companies were eager to establish cooperative ventures with local firms that would allow them to supply music to a vast listening audience currently largely supplied from illicit music production lines, the executives said.
""The Chinese market has enormous potential,"" EMI Europe President Rupert Perry told reporters in Beijing, adding that China was making progress in its crackdown on piracy.
Beijing vowed to clamp down on pirates and prise open its cultural markets in a June agreement with the United States that narrowly averted a multibillion dollar cross-Pacific trade war over violations of intellectual property rights.
Analysts and some industry figures have cast doubt on China's commitment to wipe out piracy, but the music executives said they had been encouraged by their talks with Chinese copyright and publishing officials.
""Our conversations with Chinese officials in the last couple of days lead us to believe that they are very cognisant of the problem and doing everything that they can to control it,"" said Perry.
""The laws are in place, they have an understanding of what has to happen and yes, they have had successes in closing certain factories,"" he said. ""We believe that will continue.""
The executives, who are part of a trade delegation to China led by European Commission Vice President Sir Leon Brittan, said they hoped to build an industry that would develop Chinese musical talent for a domestic and international audience.
The multimillion dollar Chinese music market had the potential to grow 10-fold over the next few years, industry officials in the delegation said.
""We... tried to explain to the Chinese what we could do together,"" said Polygram Far East president Norman Cheng, ""They have been pretty receptive to all these ideas.""
""This is our first round of meetings,"" said Michael Smellie, senior vice president of BMG Entertainment International Asia Pacific. ""We were encouraged.""
Music imports into China were still negligible, while pirate sales were estimated at $170 million a year, roughly equivalent to the value of legitimate sales, said Adrian Strain of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).
European music companies were looking for Chinese partners to develop the local market, with former pirate firms among the potential wedding partners, the executives said.
While it was impossible to wipe out piracy with a single campaign, Beijing's crackdown on illicit production had worried illegal producers and had forced them to shift some production lines to Vietnam and even South America, IFPI officials said.",0
"A senior U.S. official on Wednesday praised Beijing's approach to international arms control but hinted at continuing concerns over the possible proliferation of Chinese nuclear and missile technology.
The rebirth of an arms control dialogue stalled by Sino-U.S. disagreements over Taiwan over the last year was a major step to bridging differences between Washington and Beijing, said John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
""Chinese positions have evolved in a very constructive direction,"" Holum told a news conference in Beijing on the third day of a five-day visit to China.
""China genuinely has been playing a much more active and very constructive role in arms control negotiations,"" he said, citing Beijing's role in negotiations towards a global nuclear test ban and for a cut-off of production of nuclear fissile material.
Holum's meetings with Chinese officials are part of a series of high-level talks intended to buttress Sino-U.S. ties, chilled by a 1995 visit to the United States by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui and by rows over copyright, trade and human rights.
Cross-Pacific relations hit a new low last March when China carried out missile tests and military exercises in the seas near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a rebel province, prompting Washington to send two aircraft carriers to the area.
A July visit to Beijing by U.S. national security adviser Anthony Lake was seen by analysts as a vital step to restoring some sense of stability to a vital diplomatic relationship.
The Sino-U.S. disputes had restricted talks on arms control and proliferation issues, Holum told reporters.
""We've obviously had an interruption of our dialogue in these areas as a result of the Lee visit and the missile activities and so on,"" he said. ""We are starting to get past that and to renew the strategic dialogue.""
Talks with Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and other officials had touched on alleged sales of Chinese missile technology to Pakistan and Beijing's civil nuclear cooperation with Iran, he said.
The Washington Post in August said U.S. intelligence officials had concluded Pakistan was secretly building a factory to make medium-range missiles using Chinese blueprints and equipment.
The report was the latest allegation of Sino-Pakistan military cooperation to raise hackles in Washington, which has in the past imposed sanctions on both for alleged missile transfers.
""There have been reports in the press and elsewhere of further missile transfers of technology,"" Holum said.
""We have not made the determination, based on the information that we have, that any further sanctions are warranted, but we routinely raise our concerns about these issues with the Chinese,"" he said.
U.S. concerns over nuclear exports to Pakistan had been much relieved by Beijing's commitment in May not to provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, he said.
Washington continued to believe that no country should share nuclear technology with Iran, a view China did not share, he said, adding that his talks had brought progress in harmonising Chinese and U.S. positions but no concrete deals.
""I didn't come here expecting any specific agreements, I was expecting we would close the gap,"" he said. ""The contact and the discussion is important because it creates a venue and an opportunity for resolving the issues.""",0
"An obscure part of the new telecommunications law could restrict how phone companies use confidential customer data to peddle everything from calling plans and caller I.D. to Internet access and credit cards.
The law pits consumer advocates who fear an onslaught of telemarketers and a loss of personal privacy against local, long-distance and cellular carriers wanting to offer their customers one-stop shopping in the new communications age.
The data, which include billing records and calling patterns, are taking on added importance as local and long-distance companies, cable-TV operators and others brace to get into each other's business under the new telecom law.
""Everybody wants to use these data -- subject to the law -- for their marketing efforts, given that it's a much more competitive environment now,"" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. ""There are new technologies and new markets for the companies.""
The Federal Communications Commission is drafting rules to spell out the limits set by Congress on the use of ""customer proprietary network information."" CPNI details when calls are made, the destination, the frequency and length, the number and type of phone lines ordered, and the price of the bill.
Few curbs existed before the new telecom law. The new FCC rules -- which stem from a provision in the law pushed by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., -- are expected in early 1997.
The agency must decide what form of customer approval a carrier must receive before using the data for marketing.
The rules will determine, for example, what if any okay is needed for a carrier to use a customer's long-distance calling pattern to pitch a cellular service if a customer is seen to make plenty of calls from the road.
Many phone companies want the FCC to avoid stringent rules requiring detailed customer approval. Industry executives argue that consumers would benefit from flexibile rules that let companies target a customer's communications needs.
""It would give us the opportunity to tailor their package of services to what they need and what they want,"" said James Spurlock, AT&T Corp.'s director of federal government affairs.
But consumer and privacy groups fear the data could fall into the wrong hands without tough curbs and clear approval.
They also fear an explosion in telemarketing: Companies could use CPNI to market a vast array of products and services unrelated to the phone service a customer actually receives.
""When consumers sign up for telehone service, they don't expect the information to be used to market non-phone services such as credit cards or investment information,"" said John Windhausen, general counsel for the Competition Policy Institute (CPI), a consumer advocacy group.
Companies already use the information. Long-distance carriers pitch cheaper plans based on a customer's calling habits. The marketing is expected to heat up.
Under contention at the FCC is whether a company can use the data derived from its long-distance business to pitch local or cellular service, without prior customer assent.
The telecom law lets carriers use CPNI without prior approval when supplying the service a customer ordered.
The FCC has proposed to classify phone service under three categories: local, long distance and cellular. CPNI from one could not be used to market another without a customer's okay.
A number of phone companies, including several regional Baby Bell companies, have asked the FCC for just one broad category that would give them greater marketing flexibility.
Texas phone regulators, by contrast, propose categories based on ""the exact services (the customer) has ordered.""
The FCC also has proposed requiring phone companies to notify customers of their right to restrict access to CPNI.
Under contention is whether the notification should be oral or written, such as a notice stuffed into a bill or posted in the ""white pages"" phone directory.
Consumer advocates, privacy groups and state regulators want advance written approval for use of the information.",0
"The nation's distillers Thursday formally reversed their 48-year-old voluntary ban on broadcast advertising of liquor, saying whiskey and gin should be treated just like beer and wine.
The announcement -- coming two days after the presidential election and just ahead of the holiday season -- affirms the decision by Seagram Co. Ltd. in June to begin airing TV ads for its Royal Crown and Chivas Regal whiskey.
That ad campaign has unleashed criticism from lawmakers, regulators and President Clinton. And the latest decision is sure to rachet up the debate.
""For decades, beer and wine have been advertised on television and radio while the distilled spirits industry has upheld its own voluntary ban,"" said Fred Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS).
""The absence of spirits from television and radio has contributed to the mistaken perception that spirits are somehow 'harder' or worse than beer or wine and thus deserving of harsher social, political and legal treatment.""
The reversal of the voluntary ban was adopted in DISCUS's ""code of good practice.""
The announcement drew an immediate rebuke from the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who has made it clear he is opposed to the practice and has raised the specter of new rules that would bar such advertising.
""This decision is disappointing for parents, and dangerous for our kids,"" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, whose agency has begun a probe of the ad campaign.
Consumer advocates also objected. ""Today's decision by DISCUS to dump its voluntary ban marks the beginning of an open liquor-marketing season on America's children and teens,"" said George Hacker of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
He urged President Clinton to renew his appeal to distillers to return to the voluntary ban, and he called on the Federal Trade Commission to assist the FCC in its probe.
In Congress, Rep. Joseph Kennedy has offered legislation to make it illegal to advertise hard liquor on radio or TV.
Broadcasters, meanwhile, criticized the distillers' decision but stopped short of refusing to run liquor ads.
The National Association of Broadcasters advocated to continue leaving the decision on whether to air the ads to individual TV and radio stations.
""We believe this process has served American consumers well, since individual stations make and will continue to make judgments every day on what is most appropriate for their local audiences,"" said NAB President Edward Fritts.",0
"The brouhaha over Newt Gingrich's intercepted telephone call has shed light on how easy it is to eavesdrop on cellular calls and how seldom cases are prosecuted -- even though the law is violated daily.
""It's had the chilling effect of reminding us all that anyone at any time could be listening to our most private conversations,"" Rep. Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican, said of the widely publicized incident involving the House speaker.
Tauzin, who chairs the House of Representatives telecommunications subcommittee, has called for hearings into cellular privacy.
Federal law makes it a crime to intentionally intercept or disclose the contents of a telephone call, regardeless of whether it is over a hard-wired, cellular or cordless phone.
But experts can cite only a handful of cell-phone cases that have drawn publicity. Politicians have been involved.
Justice Department spokesman John Russell said that in the case of cellular calls, the law is ""seldom used"" and the department ""seldom"" gets complaints.
For one, people rarely know when they have been overheard on their cell phone. And the complicated law is little known.
In once case, Sen. Charles Robb, a Virginia Democrat, got into hot water in 1991 over an illegal tape recording of a cellular call made by a political rival, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder. Robb was spared indictment. Four associates pleaded guilty in the case.
Another case in 1990 centered on an intercepted cell-phone conversation involving then-Rep. Bill Sarpalius, a Democrat from Texas.
Tapes and transcripts of the call -- in which Sarpalius spoke with a young woman about a date and a possible job -- were made available to local media. Two unrelated men were later fined about $250 each in connection with the incident.
Why the dearth of legal action?
""Violations of this law are very, very hard to detect. That is why there are so few cases,"" said Clifford Fishman, a law professor at Catholic University of America in Washington.
""The person whose privacy is invaded usually never hears about it and so does not alert authorities.""
What's more, the eavesdroppers usually are not familiar with the people they are monitoring. Penalties generally are light, except in cases involving repeat offenses or use of the information to commit another crime.
The only times a case does seem to arise is when the perpetrator tries to capitalize on the conversation.
""It doesn't come to light unless somebody makes political or commercial use of the information,"" said Paul Rothstein, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington.
Yet experts agree the law is broken frequently -- possibly hundreds or thousands of times a day -- given the availability and use of scanners that can tune in wireless calls. It's estimated that anywhere from 10 million to 20 million scanners are in use nationwide, many able to eavesdrop on cellular calls.
""While the cellular industry may give their customers the illusion of privacy by assuring customers that it is illegal to listen, and that cellular-capable scanners are no longer manufactured or imported into the United States, millions of Americans do listen in,"" according to Bob Grove, publisher of Monitoring Times Magazine.
Last week, the FBI opened an investigation into the taping and leaking of a telephone conference call between Gingrich and his top lieutenants. The probe came after a Florida couple said they  delivered a tape of the cellular phone conversation to the senior Democrat on the House Ethics Committee.
A transcript of the tape was published in two newspapers two days later, prompting Republican calls for an FBI criminal probe into the source of the leak.
""You're not going to see the law enforced unless it involves a person of rank, such as a politician,"" said Linus Layne Baker, a Kansas City, Mo. attorney who was fined in the Texas case. ""You won't see the media prosecuted either.""
One option under study in wake of the Gingrich incident is whether to beef up a law that outlaws the sale, manufacture or imporation of scanners capable of picking up cellular calls.",0
"Federal regulators are set to kick off a two-part plan to slash rates on overseas phone calls, a move that could save consumers and companies billions of dollars but may ruffle the feathers of foreign governments.
The Federal Communications Commission is expected Tuesday to make it simpler for U.S. and foreign phone companies to negotiate cheaper rates for international calls to and from the United States.
Next month the FCC is expected to propose rules to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete overseas calls made from the United States.
""The ultimate goal is to get lower-priced and better-quality services for consumers,"" said Don Gips, head of the FCC's international bureau.
Officials say the foreign charges, or ""accounting rates,"" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. Monopolies control more than 90 percent of the non-U.S. market.
U.S. phone companies, as a result, paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.
""This figure would drop in half overnight if American carriers simply paid fees even vaguely related to costs,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said in a recent speech. He noted that the imbalance dwarfs the U.S. foreign aid budget of $2 billion.
While the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country.
The United States has big imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others.
""Those few countries trying to defend their monopolies are going to be nervous"" about the FCC effort, said Dan Rosen of the Institute for International Economics.
U.S. carriers support the strategy.
""You've got to move accounting rates to cost,"" said AT&T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme. AT&T said it must pay 45 cents a minute to have its calls connected to the Dominican Republic, but that the actual cost is 7 to 8 cents a minute.
The FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.
To cut rates and open markets, the FCC is adopting a carrot-and-stick approach. Tuesday's order is meant for open markets, such as possibly Britain, Canada and Chile.
The FCC will waive its ""proportionate return"" rules that limit the ability of U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate lower rates for overseas calls. To win a waiver, a foreign carrier's home market must be open to competition.
The existing rules require overseas companies to turn over their long-distance calls to U.S. carriers in the same proportion U.S. carriers send calls to a foreign carrier's home market.
If AT&T, for example, accounts for 60 percent of calls to a country, then that country's monopoly must hand off 60 percent of its U.S.-bound calls to AT&T.
The FCC proposal due next month would set ""benchmark"" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.
The agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.
""It literally has the potential of saving consumers billions of dollars,"" said Scott Harris, an attorney with Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
But the plan could rub governments the wrong way. High rates charged by their own phone monopolies can be used to maintain bloated payrolls or to subsidise local phone service.",0
"The Federal Communications Commission reined in its regulation of long-distance telephone rates Tuesday by scrapping a Depression-era rule requiring phone carriers to tell the agency beforehand of rate changes.
FCC officials said the move was designed to inject more competition into the $70 billion long-distance market and cut thousands of pages of government red tape for long-distance companies such as AT&T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp.
But industry officials and consumer advocates argued the new approach will lead to consumer confusion and make it tougher for consumers to get the best possible deals.
The 1934 rule the FCC ended forced long-distance carriers to tell the FCC ahead of time of plans to change rates or offer new services via ""tariff"" filings with the agency.
The rule was intended originally to let regulators approve or reject the changes while giving the public an advance look.
Under the new approach, companies will be required to disclose their rates and conditions to the public, such as through ad campaigns or over the Internet computer network.
FCC officials said the onset of greater competition in the long-distance market made the old rule outdated. They said that few people actually read the complex filings.
Officials said elimination of the tariff requirement removes the opportunity for long-distance carriers to tacitly collude on phone rates by getting a preview of their competitors' pricing policies.
""Competition will intensify and consumer benefits will increase as a result,"" said Commissioner Susan Ness.
The tariff filings currently take effect one day after their submission to the FCC. When AT&T was classified a ""dominant"" carrier, the No. 1 long-distance company had to wait up to 60 days. The FCC ended AT&T's dominant status last fall.
The new approach is the first major step the FCC has taken under a part of the new telecommunications law allowing the agency to shed outdated rules, as long as the public interest is unharmed. The new rules will take effect in nine months.
""We think it's a terrible mistake,"" said Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America. ""You need informed choices."" He noted that groups such as his use the data from the tariff filings to help consumers find the best phone packages and avoid questionable deals.
Industry officials had sought -- but without success -- to retain the option of submitting tariff filings for certain residential and small-business phone plans, saying that would make it easier for customers know their phone rates.
""While AT&T has always favoured less regulation, we're concerned the FCC's decision to mandate the end of tariffs will lead to more consumer confusion and possible litigation,"" said AT&T Vice President Gerry Salemme.",0
"Television industry moguls crafting a ratings system should spell out sexual and violence content of shows, not rely solely on a system like the motion picture code, a survey of parents issued Thursday concluded.
The nationwide survey of 679 parents showed 80 percent preferred a system that specified the level of violence, sex or bad language rather than the age group for which a program is intended, as the motion picture industry's 28-year-old system does for movies.
The survey was a joint effort of the National Parent Teacher Association, the Institute for Mental Health Initiatives and University of Wisconsin researchers. It came as TV executives raced to complete a ratings system in the next month.
The executives favor an approach like the alphabetical code used by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for movies. Individual networks would rate their shows.
But the survey sponsors -- along with Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. -- want a system that covers content and viewer age.
""Parents want it all. They want every shred of information available about every program,"" said Markey, the author of a provision in the new communications law requiring TV makers to install a ""V-chip"" in all new sets. The device can be used with the upcoming ratings to let parents block shows they consider too violent or racy.
Markey told a news conference it would be ""very unfortunate"" if the TV industry ignored the survey results and did not incorporate the kind of system used by the Home Box Office cable-TV movie channel to rate its shows. Each HBO show is given a rating based on content such as ""MV"" for ""mild violence"" or ""SC"" for ""strong sexual content.""
Markey vowed the groups sponsoring the poll would ""scream to the high heavens"" if the TV ratings ignored program content.
MPAA President Jack Valenti, overseeing the ratings' creation, said his group welcomed all suggestions. ""We are trying to devise a TV parental guidance system which will be family friendly, easy to understand, easy to use, and most of all grounded in honorable purposes so that parents can better monitor and supervise the TV watching of their children.""",0
"The nation's top communications regulator Friday appealed to nearly 1,200 television stations nationwide to adhere to a voluntary ban and refrain from airing liquor advertisements.
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt, speaking a day after a liquor industry group said it would end its own voluntary ban on radio and TV promotions, also said he had no immediate plans to issue rules to block such ads.
""That is a long, long and hard road to travel,"" Hundt said of the rulemaking process.
For now, the FCC chairman plans instead to use his position as a bully pulpit to convince TV stations not owned by the four major networks to abstain from showing ads for gin, whiskey and other spirits.
Seagram Co. Ltd. in June began airing TV ads for its Royal Crown whiskey in selected local markets.
The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), while ""disappointed"" with the lifting of the decades-old ban by the nation's distillers, declined to embrace Hundt's call for a voluntary ban.
Hundt applauded the decision by the big networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox -- to leave unchanged their own policies against accepting liquor ads. Together, the four own about 50 stations in major markets.
That leaves just under 1,200 commercial stations scattered across the nation not owned by the major networks.
""The government has many, many options available to it. It's not necessary for these options to be explored if the broadcasters will stand up the way the four major networks have done,"" Hundt told a news conference.
NAB President Edward Frits, however, noted that ""over the years, individual stations have adopted their own standard regarding the acceptability of hard liquor advertising.
""We believe this process has served American consumers well, since individual stations make and will continue to make judgments every day on what is most appropriate for their local audiences,"" he said in a statement.
On Thursday, the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, or Discus, said it formally ended its decades-old voluntary ban on radio and TV liquor ads. The ban had been in place since 1936 for radio and 1948 for TV.
The group said distillers should enjoy the same right to promote their products as beer and wine producers, whose ads are carried on TV. Over the past 14 years, liquor consumption in the United States has tumbled 28 percent, to 325 million gallons last year from 449 million in 1981.
The Seagram ad campaign already has unleashed criticism from lawmakers, regulators, consumer advocates and President Clinton. The FCC has opened its own probe of ads shown in Texas and New Hampshire.
Meanwhile, other liquor makers have said they are planning their own ad campaigns or are considering their options.",0
"Ameritech Corp. won an important endorsement Wednesday from Michigan regulators in its bid to become the first Baby Bell to offer long-distance telephone service from its local calling region.
The Michigan Public Service Commission voted to advise the Federal Communications Commission that it appears Ameritech has met a 14-point checklist for opening its local phone network in the state to new competitors -- such as AT&T Corp. and other companies wanting to offer local phone service.
That checklist was spelled out under last year's big communications law as a condition for local carriers to offer long-distance service from their regions.
""We're extremely disappointed with this decision. It seems to ignore the overwhelming evidence that Ameritech faces no viable local telephone competition in Michigan,"" said an AT&T spokesman. An Ameritech spokesman was not available.
The FCC will make the final determination on whether Ameritech has indeed met the technical checklist for entry into the $78 billion long-distance market.
But a negative review from Michigan would have dimmed the Chicago-based carrier's prospects considerably. The Justice Department must issue a recommendation to the FCC by Feb. 21.
Ameritech asked the FCC on Jan. 2 for permission to provide long-distance service to residents in Michigan, one of five Midwestern states in which the company provides local phone service. Ameritech has 3.5 million customers in Michigan.
Long-distance carriers such as AT&T and MCI Communications Corp. have called on regulators to reject Ameritech's request, saying the company has not yet opened its local market fully to competitors.
The Michigan commission said that in a 2-1 vote among commissioners the agency authorised the filing of its comments in the Ameritech case with the FCC.
""For many years, the Michigan Public Service Commission has supported allowing expanded choice for telephone customers,"" said commission Chairman John Strand.
""Our comments today are designed to assist the Federal Communications Commission to follow a course that will introduce more competition in the telecommunications marketplace.""
After filing its initial request with the FCC, Ameritech was forced to amend its application with an additional 1,500 pages of documents. Regulators had determined that many needed pages were missing.
Other Baby Bells are expected to ask the FCC for similar approval soon.",0
"Negotiations between American Airlines and its pilots union continued into the early hours of Friday, with neither side reporting any breakthrough that would avert a midnight strike at the nation's No. 2 carrier.
A federal mediator refereeing the talks at a downtown hotel informed the pilots that American had rejected a key union contract proposal covering who should pilot -- and at what pay -- the carrier's smaller American Eagle planes.
Mediators are shuttling back and forth between the two sides offering hypothetical ""what if"" proposals on a variety of issues in an effort the bring the two sides closer together and prevent a midnight Friday (0500 GMT Saturday) strike by the pilots which would throw the nation's air transport system into turmoil.
""They're going to work all night, throughout the night. All day (Friday),"" said Dave Bates, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,000 pilots.
He said the union is ""disappointed at the lack of progress"" so far.
""We will continue to negotiate for as long as it takes. But (Friday) night at midnight the pilots will be on strike.""
Bates said no face-to-face talks had as yet been scheduled. An American spokesman would only say that the negotiations were continuing.
Going into the talks on Thursday evening, Kenneth Hipp, chairman of the National Mediation Board, said he was hopeful an agreement could be worked out in time to avert a strike.
The union had proposed that its pilots fly the American Eagle flights, but with lower pay than pilots flying the regular American aircraft. American, however, wants to continue using lower-paid commuter pilots from a different union to fly the smaller planes.
While the mediator has informed the union of the airline's rejection of the proposal on small planes, union officials said the company itself has not notified them directly of that.
The dispute also centres around the pilots' pay. They now earn an average of about $120,000 a year.
The union earlier had said it would offer a new pay proposal -- probably less than the 11.5 percent over four years it had sought. The latest reported offer from American was a 6 percent boost over four years.
A strike would ground 2,200 American flights on Saturday and affect about 200,000 passengers. American, a unit of AMR Corp., accounts for about 20 percent of the nation's airline capacity.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline is trying to rebook passengers on other carriers and has already cancelled nearly all international flights scheduled for Friday night.
American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said on Thursday the carrier was cancelling 12 of its domestic flights scheduled for Friday. ""There are some small domestic airports where we have no permanent place to park the planes if there is a strike, so we decided to cancel those 12 flights.""
A Transportation Department official said a strike could cost the U.S. economy up to $200 million a day.
American Airlines Chairman Robert Crandall called for binding government arbitration of the dispute, a proposal the pilots have repeatedly rejected.
""I think mandatory binding arbitration should be required"" to prevent airline strikes, Crandall told a congressional subcommittee. Binding arbitration would mean both parties agreed to abide by the decision of an arbitrator.
""I seriously doubt we could accept that,"" union spokesman Wally Pitts said.
Crandall told a hearing of a House of Representatives Transportation subcommittee he was unsure if a strike could be avoided. ""We have two choices: we can either cave in or take a strike. A strike of 90 days will destroy this airline.""
As the talks entered their fourth day of intensive bargaining, President Bill Clinton was keeping a close watch.
Clinton could intervene and name an emergency board to try to resolve the issues. Under the Railway Labour Act, which also covers airlines, the president has the power to declare a national emergency to stop a strike and to keep planes flying for 60 days. The last time such an action was taken in an airlines strike was in 1966.
But at an unrelated news conference on Thursday, Clinton repeated that the parties should use the government mediator to reach an agreement.",0
"The government's largest wireless phone auction ended Tuesday, with prices taking a U-turn back toward earth after 125 companies bid a total of $2.5 billion to offer a new generation of cellular service.
The total was down 75 percent from a similar Federal Communications Commission auction that raised $10.2 billion last May. The average price for a license to provide ""personal communications services,"" or PCS, tumbled more than 90 percent.
PCS technology is expected to turn the wireless phone into a mass-market product, allowing consumers to use different communications services -- such as phone, paging, fax and Internet access -- through a single handheld device.
The drop reflected the flood of new entrants into the wireless phone market, a dearth of new money after the sky-high prices paid at last year's PCS sale, and the smaller slice of airwaves covered by the new licenses, analysts said.
The top bidder this time around was a unit of No. 3 long-distance carrier Sprint Corp. It bid $544 million for 160 licenses in Chicago, Houston, and Atlanta, among other cities.
Next was a unit of long-distance giant AT&T Corp., which bid $407 million for 222 licenses in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, followed by a unit of BellSouth Corp., which bid $205 million for 39 licenses.
The No. 4 bidder was OPCSE-Galloway Consortium, a consortium made up of Omnipoint Corp. of Arlinton, Va., and Galloway Entrepreneurs of Charlottesville, Va. It bid $181 million for 109 licenses.
The FCC sold 1,479 PCS licenses nationwide in three different blocks, making this the most licenses sold at once. A third were reserved for small companies. Markets that generated the highest bidding were New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Based on the population sizes covered by the licenses, the average bid at the auction was just $3.32 a person.
That was down from the average bid of $39.88 at last May's ""C-Block"" sale, which was reserved for small companies. Analysts called those prices too high for companies to make much money.
The FCC's first PCS auction, which raised $7.7 billion and ended in March 1995, had an average bid of $15.54.
""It's phenomenally cheaper,"" said Jonathan Foxman, vice president of Americall International, a Phoenix-based PCS firm that bid at the auction.
Mark Lowenstein, a vice president with Boston consulting firm Yankee Group Inc., called the latest prices ""more reflective of the current market reality.""
Analysts listed several factors behind the lower prices.
The airwave parcels sold, at 10 megahertz (MHz) each, were a third the size of the 30 MHz parcels sold at the two prior auctions and thus less attractive. The permits cover less geographic area.
Analysts also said the wireless market was getting crowded with companies holding PCS and traditional cellular licenses -- meaning less profits.
""The market is going to be too crowded,"" predicted P. William Bane, a director at Mercer Management Consulting.
The steep prices at last year's PCS auction meant less money available this time around. ""The latest prices are an indication that people have run out of money,"" said Bane.
In addition, analysts said, Wall Street has not rushed to extend financing to PCS providers.",0
"The Clinton administration is making a $36 billion bet in its new budget that companies will rush to pay big bucks for a chunk of the airwaves to roll out newfangled communications services to the public.
As a part of the bet, the administration is wagering it can overcome major political forces, such as TV broadcasters, opposed to aggressive plans for selling spectrum.
Experts are split on whether the wager will pay off.
To finance its fiscal 1998 budget, the White House proposed Thursday to raise $36.1 billion by selling licenses to firms wanting to sell new ways to link to the Internet or send video images through the air, among other things.
The administration also proposed to auction toll-free 888 phone numbers instead of giving them away.
The White House, however, offered few details about its grand auction plan, which covers the five years through 2002.
Many economists think the $36 billion is achievable because of the large amounts of spectrum still available and the rush by companies to develop new products incorporating the Internet and other communications services.
""There's a lot of unmet demand for frequencies that can be used to offer new services,"" said James Gatusso of Citizens for a Sound Economy, a free-market advocacy group.
""A lot of people are coming through the front door of the Federal Communications Commission asking for spectrum.""
Among the new services that could be rolled out in the future over newly available spectrum: high-speed wireless access to the Internet or mobile video services that allow drivers to download maps or traffic pictures in their cars.
Critics charge that any aggressive bid to sell spectrum to companies that want to use it for any purpose will backfire by driving down airwave prices and hurting companies -- such as wireless phone providers -- that already hold licenses.
""What they will do is drive the price of spectrum to zero and therefore kill the goose that lays the golden egg,"" said Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, an industry trade group representing cellular carriers and other wireless phone providers.
Since 1994, the FCC has raised about $23 billion through 12 spectrum auctions for wireless cable television, satellite TV, a new generation of cellular phones and other services.
The White House proposed four auctions to raise:
-- $700 million through the sale of 888 phone numbers.
-- $17.1 billion by extending and broadening the FCC's auction powers to sell spectrum not used by TV stations.
-- $3.5 billion to sell part of the airwaves now occupied by TV channels 60-69. The channels would be made available through the transition to high-definition digital TV.
-- $14.8 billion through the sale of the analogue spectrum now occupied by TV broadcasters. The frequencies also would become available in the transition to digital TV.
The administration wants to speed up the return of the analogue spectrum to the government by requiring stations to return it by 2005. The auction would be held in 2002.
But broadcasters want to postpone any auction.
""We remain opposed to upfront auctions or accelerated giveback of broadcast spectrum. We expect the government will receive full value for spectrum once the broadcast industry transition to digital is complete,"" said Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters.
The NAB supports an FCC plan for an approximately 15-year transition to digital broadcasts.",0
"The federal government's bid to pry open the phone business has hit a snag that could postpone the onset of full-blown competition in the local and long-distance markets and delay cheaper phone service.
The snag came when a federal appeals court Tuesday suspended, or stayed, key parts of a Federal Communications Commission rule opening local phone monopolies to competition from long-distance carriers, cable TV operators and others.
Experts said the action could postpone competition in the $100 billion local phone market now controlled by the regional Baby Bell phone companies, until the case makes its way through the courts in coming months. A final decision could easily take a year or more.
""We're in for a very messy 1997, and the dust won't settle until fairly deep into 1997,"" said Henry Geller, a former top telecommunications official in the Commerce Department.
That, in turn, could delay the Baby Bells' entrance into the $70 billion long-distance market. The telecommunications law enacted in February lets the Bells offer long-distance only after they have opened their own markets to new rivals.
Even before the appeals court acted, government officials suggested a prolonged delay of the FCC's rules would make it tougher for regulators to allow the Bells to enter the long-distance business.
The FCC -- along with the Justice Department and state regulators -- has the final say over whether the Bells have satisfied a 14-point ""checklist"" that includes provisions of the now-suspended FCC rule.
""If the stay chills investment and retards new entry into the local marketplace, it may become more difficult for the (FCC) to authorise the Bell companies to offer long-distance (service),"" FCC Commissioner Susan Ness said in a speech only hours before the appeals court order.
And she noted that the Justice Department -- whose views ""must be accorded 'substantial weight'"" by the FCC -- already has signalled it will be reluctant to support Baby Bell entry as long as as the key parts of the FCC's proposed rules are on ice.
David Turetsky, deputy assistant attorney general in the department's antitrust division, said last month a stay would ""seriously impair"" the Bell entry process spelled out in the telecommunications law.
Any delays could delay the benefits of competition that Congress and President Clinton promised when enacting the law.
""The sooner there is competition in the local market, the consumer will benefit. And that's for sure when the Bells are allowed to go into long distance,"" said Geller.
""That will result in marketing and price wars. And the consumer again will greatly benefit.""
But Baby Bell stocks rallied after the ruling because state regulators were likely to call for lower discounts when the companies lease their phone lines to new competitors, analysts said.
GTE, the nation's largest local phone company -- which has spearheaded the legal challenge to the FCC rules -- jumped $3.625 to $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
BellSouth added $2.50 to $38.875, Bell Atlantic gained $2.125 to $60.875, NYNEX rose $1.625 to $44.50, Ameritech was up $1.75 to $56.125 and Pacific Telesis rose $1.28 to $34.66, all on the NYSE.
The appeals court suspended the FCC rule until the judges consider a challenge to the measure early next year by GTE Corp., the Bells, other local carriers and state regulators.
They argue the FCC overstepped its power by requiring the Bells and local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at steep discounts of up to 25 percent.
The court's action, for now, puts back in the hands of state regulators the responsibility to set such prices.
But local phone company officials discount the chance that competition will be delayed.
""The Telecommunications Act of 1996 passed by Congress in February is the law of the land and sets forth a timetable for the introduction of competition,"" said GTE Senior Vice President William Barr. He said that timetable is ""unaffected"" by the court's action and will proceed.",0
"The Supreme Court Tuesday declined a request by federal regulators and long-distance phone companies to reactivate landmark rules intended to pry open the nation's local phone monopolies to competition.
The denial means key terms and conditions for deregulating the $100 billion local phone market will for now depend on the decisions of state regulators in the 50 states -- instead of on uniform rules issued by the Federal Communications Commission.
The denial was a defeat for the FCC and long-distance giants AT&T Corp.  and MCI Communications Corp., which had sought to reinstate FCC rules suspended by a U.S. appeals court pending a legal challenge to the rules. Supreme Court Justice Thomas had declined to restore them.
It was a victory for the regional ""Baby Bell"" companies, GTE Corp.  , other local carriers and state regulators who are seeking to overturn the rules in the appeals court in St. Louis. They argue that the FCC unfairly snatched from the states power to issue policies governing pricing and other matters.
The rules spell out how long-distance companies, cable-TV operators, utilities and others wanting to get into the local phone business can plug into local networks under the new federal telecommunications law.
""For all practical purposes the states have complete control over the prices new entrants will pay to share the existing telephone networks during the critical period when competition is supposed to begin in local telephone markets,"" FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said after the high court's denial.
The appeals court temporarily suspended the rules last month, saying the FCC probably erred when it drafted them.
On Oct. 31, Justice Thomas declined a request by the FCC and its long-distance allies to lift the lower court's ""stay."" They separately asked Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and John Paul Stevens to reconsider the request, and the justices referred the matter to the entire court.
""The stay prevents grossly arbitrary and distored pricing rules from going into effect and ruining the whole process,"" said GTE General Counsel William Barr. ""It does not delay the timetable set forth in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 for the introduction of competition, but instead allows for a more level playing field.""
Oral arguments in the case are set for January. FCC Chairman Hundt conceded Friday it was unlikely the appeals court would decide in favour of the FCC, and he doubted that the rules would be put into effect for at least 1-1/2 years, if ever, while they were fought over in the courts.
Hundt was encouraged, however, by the actions of state regulators arbitrating connection agreements between the Bells and their long-distance rivals.
He said key provisions of the arbitration decisions issued thus far were similar to the suspended FCC rules.
Iowa, Texas, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania have been among the states that have issued decisions that will lay the groundwork for arbitrated agreements between the Bells and AT&T, MCI and No. 3 long-distance company Sprint Corp.
""There hasn't been any evidence that the states are going off and doing any wild and crazy stuff,"" said analyst Robert Mayer of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group.",0
"A U.S. appeals court in St. Louis is set to hear arguments Friday on whether to reactivate or throw out a major Federal Communications Commission order opening the $100 billion local phone market to competition.
Lawyers and analysts predict the FCC and its long-distance phone company allies will lose the latest battle to GTE Corp., the Baby Bells, other local carriers and state regulators who want to overturn the order. It spells out how new entrants to the local phone business can link to Bell local networks.
The appeals court suspended the FCC order in October, pending Friday's case. ""The FCC faces a tough uphill battle,"" said attorney Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. ""This case is headed for the Supreme Court.""
As a result, the FCC's ""interconnection"" order is likely to hang in legal limbo for at least a year while it is fought over in court -- a prospect analysts expect will cloud the phone industry's outlook and weigh on phone company stocks.
""It adds to the uncertainty out there,"" said analyst Scott Cleland of Schwab Washington Research Group.
The order was meant to implement the 1996 communications law, which allowed local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others into each other's business.
The appeals court, in suspending the order, sided with the local carriers and state regulators who charged that the FCC overstepped its power by issuing national rules on pricing and other matters instead of leaving those issues to the states.
The court wrote that opponents ""have a better than even chance of convincing the court the the FCC's pricing rules conflict with the plain meaning"" of the 1996 law.
With the order expected to remain on ice for a while, lawyers and analysts said state regulators and federal judges will have the chief job of prying open local phone monopolies to long-distance companies such as AT&T Corp. and others.
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt warned that piecemeal deregulation -- with judges around the nation ultimately deciding terms for opening local phone markets -- would have a ""very negative impact"" on industry efforts to raise capital.
FCC officials have said the case will not be resolved before the high court until spring 1998, at the earliest.
The order requires the Bells and other local carriers to lease their phone lines to new competitors at discounts of up to 25 percent.
The FCC also ordered local carriers to ""unbundle"" their local networks into pieces -- such as call-switching devices and operator and directory assistance -- so new competitors can lease components to complete their own networks.
The ""unbundled elements"" were to be priced at competitive levels based on the cost of new and more-efficient facilities.
In the meantime, state regulators have been issuing decisions on terms for opening the local markets. FCC Chairman Hundt said that despite the suspension of his agency's order, 29 of 31 states so far have adopted the FCC pricing policies.
But even those decisions are being challenged. GTE Corp. in particular, as well as AT&T, have appealed some of those rulings to federal courts around the country.
Henry Geller, a former FCC general counsel, blamed the legal morass on Congress, saying lawmakers ""botched"" the job of writing the 1996 law. ""The whole idea was that the courts weren't going to be determining this,"" he said.",0
"Regulators took the first of two steps Tuesday to slash the cost of overseas phone calls for consumers and businesses, making it easier for U.S. and foreign carriers to negotiate cheaper international rates.
The Federal Communications Commission hopes to save U.S. callers billions of dollars by backing up the new rules with a plan next month to cut the charges U.S. carriers pay foreign phone monopolies to complete calls from the United States.
Americans spend about 16 cents a minute for a domestic call. But they must shell out an average of 99 cents a minute to call overseas -- even though the cost of the calls are not much different, according to FCC officials.
""At 99 cents a minute, you're not going to get a global information highway,"" complained FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.
Tuesday's rules are targeted at countries whose own phone markets are open to competition from U.S. carriers, or are in the process of opening. FCC officials cited Canada, Britain, Chile and Sweden, as well as Europe and Mexico.
The FCC will waive rules that limit the ability of U.S. carriers to negotiate cheaper calling rates with an overseas phone company whose own market is considered open. The rules were crafted to prevent market abuse by foreign monopolies.
Don Gips, head of the FCC's International Bureau, said the new rules ""will allow competitive pressures, rather than archaic rules,"" to govern the telecommunications market.
AT&T Corp. Vice President Gerry Salemme said they ""can lead to a significant reduction in the amount that American consumers pay for international telephone calls.""
Under the new approach, a company such as AT&T -- with FCC approval -- could ask competing foreign carriers to bid for the right to handle AT&T phone traffic from the United States to a foreign market.
Alternatively, a U.S. carrier could offer end-to-end service from the United States to a foreign market without using the existing rate system for completing calls.
Officials say these ""accounting rates"" run five to 10 times actual costs, reflecting the power of state-run monopolies unexposed to home competition. U.S. carriers paid their overseas counterparts $5.5 billion more in 1995 than foreign companies paid U.S. carriers to complete calls.
While the accounting rates paid by both carriers are about equal, the imbalance reflects the fact that many more overseas calls are made from the United States than into this country.
International calls from the United States account for about a quarter of all international calls worldwide.
To reduce the rates, the FCC proposal scheduled for next month would set ""benchmark"" rates for what U.S. carriers could pay foreign carriers to complete calls. These rates, according to FCC officials, would better reflect actual costs.
The agency must still work out the details of how long a country would have to lower its rates and what steps could be taken if it refused to do so.
The FCC actions come as the United States is seeking to open overseas telecommunications markets through talks sponsored by the World Trade Organisation.
The United States has big rate imbalances with China, Jamaica, Mexico, Hong Kong, Columbia and Argentina, among others. Next month's proposal is likely to ruffle feathers.
""There will be concern from countries around the world with the benchmark item. There's no doubt about that,"" said the FCC's Gips.",0

"The television and entertainment industries vowed Thursday to use only their system for rating TV programmes and promised to reject -- by legal means, if necessary -- any government-imposed plan.
Following months of work, a group of TV and Hollywood executives are scheduled next week to unveil plans for a system to rate shows based on their suitability for kids of different ages, especially those under 14 years of age.
It will be similar to the 28-year-old system of letters and numbers used by the motion-picture industry and which includes the ratings G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17.
""We will not use any other TV rating guidelines other than the ones we are going to announce next week,"" said Jack Valenti, chief executive of the Motion Picture Association of America and head of the ""implementation group"" developing the ratings.
But parental groups, children's advocates, educators and some key lawmakers -- including Representative Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat -- have demanded that the group include a content-based system specifying the level of sex, violence and bad language.
Lawmakers have not ruled out a legislative fix.
""It is clear that the industry has so far failed to respond adequately to the fundamental interest of parents in knowing the specific content of TV shows in advance,"" Markey said at a news conference accompanied by other lawmakers and groups pushing for a content-based system like the one now used by the HBO cable channel.
At a press conference responding to Markey, Valenti lashed back. He accused Markey of trying to use government as a ""big brother"" to impose his own scheme. And Valenti vowed not to bend under pressure and alter his group's system.
""We're not going to change a word of it. We're not going to redot an 'i' or recross a 't,'"" Valenti said. ""If there is any intervention by government, we're going to be in court in a nanosecond.""
The Federal Communications Commission also must approve or reject the ratings system. If it were to reject it, the agency could call for development of an alternative plan -- one that Valenti said the industry would ignore.
Once the ratings are implemented in January, Valenti did say the industry would revisit the system after about a year to determine whether it should be changed or ""tweaked.""
""Is it perfect? Of course not. All subjective systems are flawed. So is ours,"" Valenti said.
The ratings -- expected to include six broad categories -- will not apply to news, news magazine shows such as ""60 Minutes"" or sports. TV networks and syndicators will issue the ratings, with the categories ""mingling"" age and content, according to Valenti.
Proposed guidelines leaked to the media include two for children: ""TV-K"" for kids and suitable for all ages; and ""TV-K7"" for children older than seven.
The other four are: ""TV-G"" for general audiences; ""TV-PG,"" parental guidance suggested; ""TV-14"" for parents strongly cautioned; and ""TV-M"" for mature audiences only.
The rating are to be used in conjunction with a ""V-chip"" installed in TV sets that allow parents to block out shows they consider too violent or racy.
The HBO system, developed in the mid-80s, offers ratings such as ""MV"" for ""mild violence,"" ""SC"" for ""strong sexual content"" and ""AL"" for ""adult language.""
But Valenti said that system is unworkable and is too complicated to appear in TV listings in the newspaper.
He also said a 19-member monitoring and oversight group will be created to oversee the new ratings. It will include a chairman and representives from the creative side of the industry, TV broadcasters and the cable-TV industry.",0
"The Federal Communications Commission is expected to curb its power to approve or reject long-distance rates by ending a Depression-era rule requiring telephone carriers to notify the FCC before rate changes.
The new rules, set to be adopted on Tuesday, are meant to pump more competition into the $70 billion long-distance market and trim government red tape for AT&T Corp, MCI Communications Corp, Sprint Corp and other long-distance carriers, said FCC officials.  
The 1934 rule that is headed for the scrap heap has forced long-distance companies to notify the FCC in advance of plans to change rates or offer new services through ""tariff"" filings with the agency.
It was intended originally to let regulators review the changes while giving the public an advance look, although the language contained in the filings is arcane and read by few.
Regulators say the new approach will let companies respond more quickly to competitors' price changes -- without the need to file burdensome paperwork with the FCC.  
They also say it will reduce the opportunity for companies to collude tacitly on long-distance rates.
And carriers will have to notify residential customers directly of a rate change. Currently, they unveil any rate increases through the complex tariff filings.
The new approach represents the first major step the FCC has taken under a provision of the new telecommunications law allowing it to shed outdated rules if the public interest is not harmed.
Currently, tariff filings take effect one day after their submission to the FCC. But it has not always been that way.  
When it was considered a ""dominant"" long-distance carrier, AT&T complained that the filings offered competitors an early look at its plans, allowing the others to mimic the move and implement it beforehand.
The top long-distance company had to wait up to 60 days after a tariff filing for a new promotional plan before it could act on the plan. A year ago, the FCC ended AT&T's dominant carrier status. That also ended the long delays.  
The FCC tried to eliminate long-distance tariff filings for ""non-dominant"" carriers such as MCI and Sprint about a dozen years ago. But a court said the agency lacked the power to do so. The FCC then asked Congress to change the law.
Industry officials have sought -- but apparently without success -- to retain the option of filing tariffs for certain residential telephone plans, saying that would make it easier to let consumers know what their phone rates are.
""We think there ought to be something in place for the mass marketplace,"" said an AT&T spokesman.  
He added that tariff filings allow residential customers to know the terms and conditions of their service. And he said they save the company the expense of having to communicate those terms and conditions to individual customers.
But critics complain that such a practice would make it tougher for consumers to know when a rate rise was coming, because it would be buried in the jargon of the tariff filing.
Officials do favor ending tariff filings for big business customers, paperwork that can run hundreds of pages. Ending the practice, they say, would give carriers added flexibility to negotiate the best deals with big customers.
Business users agree.
""It allows for individual customers to negotiate the best terms and conditions for them, while preserving the normal customer-supplier confidentiality we see in other contracts,"" said Ray Cline, director of information systems for the American Petroluem Institute, an oil industry trade group.",0
"U.S. Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday defended last year's telecommunications law against critics who charge it is a failure, saying that the Clinton administration has no plans to try and reopen the act.
""This is the first year of a process of change that will take quite some time,"" Gore told a group of reporters. He also noted that several key provisions of the sweeping law have yet to be implemented.  
The law, enacted last February 8, ripped down 62-year-old legal barriers and encouraged local and long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators, electric utilities and others to invade each other's backyards.
Gore said the difficult negotiations over the bill during the prior four years have led most participants to realize just how delicate and complex the legislation is.
""Most reasonable people believe it will be a little time before much of it is opened up,"" Gore said, echoing the view of several lawmakers on Capitol Hill.  
But critics -- including influential Arizona Republican Senator John McCain and consumer groups -- complain that despite the bill's enactment, the $100 billion local phone market remains a monopoly run by the Baby Bells and other local carriers.
They also note that the $78 billion long-distance market remains dominated by AT&T Corp, MCI Communications Corp and Sprint Corp.
Prices for communications services, instead of falling, are rising. Cable-TV rates jumped 7.8 percent last year, more than double the 3.3 percent rise in consumer prices.  
Residential interstate long-distance rates rose 3.7 percent, while intrastate long-distance rates jumped 6.1 percent.
Gore noted, however, that the increases in cable-TV rates are not a result of the new law and that they come within the guidelines established by a major 1992 cable-TV law.
Meanwhile, big cable-TV operators such as Time Warner Inc and Tele-Communications Inc have watered down plans to offer phone and other services and are instead defending their own turf.  
Gore said he was ""surprised"" by those decisions, but added that it has not been universal among all cable companies.
""I rather suspect the pioneers who make these investments will be handsomely rewarded by the market,"" Gore said. That, in turn, should spur other cable companies to take the plunge and diversify their offerings.
Meanwhile, Gore aide Greg Simon told reporters that the administration is sticking by its proposal for an expedited auction of analog spectrum that will be returned by television broadcasters during the transition to digital TV.
Under the administration plan, the government would auction the spectrum in 2002, with digital TV stations required to return their analog channel to the government no later than 2005.",0
"The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court Thursday to lift a lower court suspension of landmark federal rules aimed at prying open the nation's local telephone monopolies to competition.
The department, acting on behalf of the Federal Communications Commission, said the lower court's ""stay""  could hurt consumers by delaying the introduction of full-fledged competition in the $100 billion market.
The request comes after a U.S. appeals court based in St. Louis last week suspended key provisions of the FCC's ""interconnection"" order, which spells out how long-distance carriers, cable-TV operators and others could operate in the local phone market under the new telecommunications law.
The rules were frozen while the appeals court considers a challenge to the FCC order by GTE Corp., the so-called Baby Bell phone companies, other local carriers and state regulators who want the measure overturned.
They argue the FCC overstepped the power granted to it by Congress. The FCC, among other things, ordered the regional Bells and other local phone companies to lease their lines to new rivals at discounts of 17 percent to 25 percent.
The three-judge appeals court panel said the opponents ""have a better than even chance of convincing the court"" that the FCC's rules conflicted with the law.
But the Justice Department told the high court the appeals court action ""already imperils"" the timetable set by Congress for opening the local phone market.
""The stay draws into question not just the timing of competition in the local market, but also the timing of full entry by the Bell companies into the long-distance telephone market,"" the department added.
Long-distance carriers AT&T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., among other companies, also asked the high court on Thursday to lift the stay.
Lawyers were divided over the likely outcome.
""They have a decent shot at lifting the stay,"" said Alfred Mamlet of Steptoe & Johnson. He noted the FCC's success last year in having Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens lift a lower court stay that had blocked a major FCC airwave auction.
But others were less sure. ""It's very difficult to predict,"" said Nicholas Allard of Latham & Watkins.
The Justice Department request, along with those of the long-distance companies, is expected to go to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who oversees matters related to the St. Louis-based appeals court.
Thomas could refer the request to the full court for its consideration.",0
"Freight forwarders in Hong Kong say they have been warned that there will be a 20 percent increase in transpacific air cargo rates from the territory when the peak season starts on September 1.
Anthony Lau, vice-chairman of the 260 member Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding Agents Ltd (HAFFA), told Reuters that the 20 percent increase in the run up to Christmas was not surprising.
""I think it is fair and in line with expectations,"" Lau said.
He added it will apply to cargo destined for both the U.S. east and west coasts.

"Zhuhai, China Nov 5. (Reuter) China's flag carrier and largest airline, Air China is planning to restart flying to Los Angeles next year, Zhang Jinming, general director of the airline's advertising division said
The Beijing, Shanghai service would be ""at least twice weekly"" and use a Boeing 747-400 or Boeing 747 Combi aircraft, Zhang stated.
Los Angeles used to be part of the network but was stopped some time ago. Speaking through an interpreter, Zhang said it would be Air China's third service to the USA after San Francisco and New York.
Zhang was speaking on the opening day of China's first official air show held at the showpiece Zhuhai airport about 35 miles across the Pearl River delta from Hong Kong. Another major Chinese airline, China Southern Airlines, also confirmed at the show that it too was planning to start a Los Angeles service in March of next year.
Zhang also said Air China was expecting to soon announce a new service from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to Sydney and Melbourne. He could give no further details.
A recent New China News Agency report said Air China planned to open both the US west coast and Australian routes last month. No reason was given by Zhang for the apparent delay. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017",0
"Hong Kong-based freight forwarding company U-Freight Holdings Limited is considering opening an office in Guangzhou to take advantage of China Southern Airlines' growing international network, U-Freight managing director Anthony Fong said.
Until now, U-Freight's Chinese operations which started nine years ago have been concentrated in the north with freight forwarding operations in Beijing, Dalian and Shanghai, Fong said. U-Freight's new US$2 million, 4,200 square meter warehouse near Shanghai airport is on schedule for completion in December and Fong said he sees new potential just across the border from Hong Kong where the company was established 28 years ago.
""If Guangzhou is to have foreign flights then eventually other foreign carriers will fly into Guangzhou. It should save the trouble of trucking cargo down from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and we are investigating opening an office there,"" Fong said.
Industry observers said Guangzhou-based China Southern has invested in a new fleet of Boeing 777 aircraft to begin transcontinental services to Europe and the west coast of the USA and U-Freight is among a group of many well known freight forwarders who are eyeing the potential new market. Recent Hong Kong press reports said China Southern is starting a Guangzhou-Beijing-Amsterdam service next month and planning additional services to Los Angeles and Brisbane next year. No one at China Southern could be contacted for confirmation.
""We are just awaiting a start date for China Southern's new trans-Pacific flight,"" Fong told Reuters in an interview here.
Fong said the licensing procedure to start operations, especially to gain a Class one licence which allows freight forwarders to hold a stock of airway bills, will take time and patience.
""A proper licence in Shanghai took three years to achieve so it is early days yet but we would like to go into Guangzhou and a first step would be to set up a liaison office in the near future,"" Fong added. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017",0
"Airbus Industrie is for the first time in Asia marketing cargo space aboard the world's largest civil transporter, the consortium's press relations manager in China, David Velupillai, told Reuters.
Speaking at China's first airshow being held here, he said the Airbus A300-600 Super Transporter fleet has 800 hours a year available for wet lease. Known as the Beluga because of its giant, whale like appearance and cavernous 7.4 metre high jaw-like door, it is one of the world's most unusual aircraft which Airbus said can carry more voluminous freight than any other.
The first two of an eventual fleet of four aircraft are being used to transport large sections of fuselage and the wings for the Airbus family which are made near Chester, England and are flown to Toulouse for assembly. Other fuselage sections weighing up to 45 tons and 30 metres long are transported from Spain and Germany.
When the aircraft are not busy doing that, Airbus says it hope it can profit from wet leases of other outsize cargoes such as helicopters, aircraft engines and space satellites in which field China is a key world player with its Long March launcher.
""No other aircraft in the world can carry such large and unusual loads. The thing about satellites is they need to be transported whole and cannot be broken down for transport. It is a niche market but one we think there are opportunities in,"" Velupillai said.
Airbus said its large transporter has already been used to carry a satellite module which will form part of space station Alpha from Turin in Italy to Toulouse . Other projects include ferrying aviator Richard Branson's balloon to Morocco for his aborted round the world attempt.
The Beluga made its air show debut at Paris last year but is not being exhibited in China.
The twin engined purpose-built jets replace veteran four propellor engined Super Guppy aircraft which Airbus said are destined to become museum pieces. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017",0
"All-cargo airline Polar Air Cargo is to take delivery of its first Boeing 747-200F series aircraft at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport on December 13, an airline statement said.
The handover of the aircraft fresh from a 'C' check at Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company brings the number of B747s in the Polar fleet to 14, it added.
The carrier's chief executive officier, Ned Wallace said in the statement that Polar's fleet will increase by two to three 747's each year over the next five years. The next 747-200F is scheduled for delivery in first quarter 1997, he added.
Industry observers say Polar has a reputation for being a low cost airline using first generation former passenger 747 aircraft converted to carry around 100 tons of cargo.
The U.S. based carrier said it is anticipating a ""significant jump"" in its Asian operations if the U.S. Department of Transportation finalises a ""tentative"" decision awarding Polar the new U.S.-Japan all-cargo route.
Polar said the Department of Transportation's favourable evaluation was partly due to its proposal to increase using Anchorage, Alaska as a hub to trans-load traffic between Asia, South America, Europe and the U.S.
""The final award of the Japan route will mark the culmination of a three year strategy by Polar to create an effective global network of operations. As we extend our geographic reach, we enhance our competitiveness by giving our customers the market access and route flexibility they need,"" Wallace added.",0
"Polar Air Cargo is to start new services to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Kansai in Japan and Manila within the next four months, the all cargo carrier's executive vice president Jack Kane said.
Speaking after the handover of Polar's first Boeing 747-200 and 14th 747 freighter in all, Kane said the new acquistion from Air Hong Kong will offer longer ranges, higher weights and reduced fuel consumption for the company's Asian network which is about to rapidly expand.
Polar is awaiting final U.S. Depart of Transportation approval to begin flying to Kansai after agreement with the Japanese transportation ministry that Polar should become the third U.S. all cargo carrier, he said.
""The indications seem very favourable,"" he said.
The U.S.-based airline has also won permission to fly to Bangkok and expects to start services to Manila in the first quarter of 1997. With approval for Kansai, and new services to London and Amsterdam which began in April, Kane said the way is now opens for a round the world service to begin early next year.
""In the next 120 days we will inaugurate services to New Delhi, Dubai, Bangkok, Kansai and the Philippines,"" Kane told reporters.
When the Kansai operation begin, Polar expects to offer four cargo flights a week from Hong Kong to the U.S. west coast and five or six to east coast all via Anchorage . The 747-200 means Polar no longer has to stop in Khabarovsk in Russia to refuel.
Polar does not have rights into China but has been holding discussions with Chinese airlines on a possible joint venture. Kane declined to name the possible partners but said Polar has already cooperated with China Eastern on charter cargo flights.
Kane said Polar intends to start operating a second 747-200 aircraft, an ex Philippine Airlines Combi which is to be converted, in the first quarter of next year. The company's long term strategy is to acquire two or three 747-200 aircraft each year for the next five years bringing the fleet total then to 23 or 24 aircraft.",0
"Engineers are investigating the cause of an engine failure aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways Limited airliner on November 11 which forced return to Ho Chi Minh City on one engine, an airline spokesman said commenting on a report in Flight International.
The Airbus A330-300 and 132 passengers had reached 37,000 feet after take-off when one of its two Rolls Royce 700 engines suffered a suspected gearbox failure. The pilots could not restart the powerplant and decided to return to Ho Chi Minh City where the engine was removed and flown back to Hong Kong for a detailed inspection, the spokesman stated.
The suspect gearbox part has since been returned to the U.K. for detailed analysis, a Rolls Royce spokesman in Hong Kong said.
Cathay has a fleet of nine Airbus A330s which seat around 320 passengers and carry up to 17 tonnes of belly cargo on inter-Asian routes. A spokeswoman for Hong Kong Dragon Airlines known as Dragonair, in which Cathay holds a minority stake, operates 4 R-R powered A330s.
R-R is a long term supplier to Cathay and since the Trent 700 engine entered service with Cathay in February 1995, this is the second recorded inflight shutdown, the Cathay spokesman said.
Industry observers say aircraft engines are now so reliable that mechanical failures are extremely rare.
Intense rivalry for new engines, particularly for the next generation of the Boeing 747 family, exists between R-R and its U.S. competitors Pratt & Whitney and General Electric s, the industry sources said. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017",0
"Virgin Group's cargo unit in Hong Kong thinks it will move significant amounts of air freight from the territory to South Africa via its new service to Johannesburg from London.
""We think there is a big market out there which is rising and that we can compete effectively via London,"" said Brinkley Chan, Assistant Manager for Dyna Trans (Hong Kong) Limited, Virgin Atlantic Cargo's Hong Kong agent.
Chan told Reuters that Virgin is offering a dedicated LD-3 container for South African bound cargo on its daily flights from Hong Kong to London.
He said Virgin's new, three times a week service to Johannesburg from London which began on October 2 can do well despite being a ""second class carrier.""
Virgin will begin flying a new shorter route to London from Hong Kong overflying China on October 27 which will permit it to carry an extra six tonnes of freight westbound.
Direct services to South Africa from Hong Kong are flown by Cathay Pacific and South African Airways.
Chan says other airlines offering indirect competition on the route include Singapore International Airlines in Singapore, Brazil's Varig via Bangkok, Gulf Air via Abu Dhabi and Emirates Airline via Dubai.

"Hong Kong Dragon Airlines (Dragonair) is about to buy two new Airbus Industrie consortium aircraft and lease another to cope with increasing demand on its routes into China, industry sources told Reuters.
The proposed deal is for two new Airbus A320 aircraft for delivery in 1998 and 1999 with options for five more and one larger Airbus A330 on lease from next year, the source said.
A Dragonair spokesman said it could not confirm the reported acquisition but he said talks on new aircraft had been taking place.
The airline which currently has a fleet of seven Airbus A320s and four A330s, recently said it will need additional aircraft.
""It is common knowledge that we have a requirement for extra capacity and we have been talking to Airbus but no announcement has been made yet,"" the spokesman said.
Industry analysts said expansion would be seen as a vote of confidence in future business prospects after a difficult period trying to develop its regional network especially into China.
Slot restrictions at Hong Kong's crowded Kai Tak airport were a major constraint, they added.
Expansion would also benefit Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd which holds an 18 percent stake in the regional carrier by feeding more passengers and cargo on its international network and vice versa, analysts said.
Dragonair recently began new services to the Chinese city of Qingdao and Khaohsiung in Taiwan. It also has full scheduled cargo rights on two of its Chinese routes to Xian and Chengdu and says it has plans for additional Chinese services to Chongqing, Urumqi and Shantou.",0
"British Airways said it will be able to carry an extra 70 tonnes of air cargo a week when its twice-daily passenger services between Hong Kong and London begin a new, shorter route over China later this month.
Chris Humphrey, BA's regional cargo manager Pacific said the new northern route over Chinese air space will mean shorter journey times for BA's Boeing 747-400 aircraft which won't need to carry as much fuel enabling the cargo payload to be increased by five to six tonnes per flight on average.
He said the new routing was negotiated during recent talks between the Chinese and British governments and also benefits BA's rivals on the route, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Virgin Atlantic. Both Cathay Pacific and Virgin Atlantic said they are also due to start the new shorter route on October 27.
""The new routing via Urumqi in China will be a real benefit to us with the start of our winter schedule on October the 27th. It means a shorter distance, less fuel and more cargo. With the extra capacity it will generate of around 70 tonnes a week which is very close to getting another 747 freighter on the route,"" Humphrey said.",0
"Israel's flag carrier El Al is to start using a Boeing 747 on its once weekly Tel Aviv to Hong Kong service as part of a drive to increase tourism and trade with the Middle East, Abraham Roter, the carrier's the airline's general manager for China, Hong Kong and east Asia said.
From the end of this month the 747 will replace a smaller Boeing 767 which flies via Tashkent. The 747 will be a direct flight from Israel to Hong Kong which will stop in Bombay to refuel on the return leg, Roter said.
El Al said it was the only airline offering a direct link to the Middle East, as opposed to carriers such as Emirates which fly to the Gulf, and which offers good connections around the Mediterranean region. The larger aircraft will increase cargo capacity from 10 upto 24 tonnes and increase passenger comfort, Roter told Reuters in an interview from his Hong Kong office.
El Al is holding a series of seminars with travel agents to try and entice more tourists from Hong Kong. Current passenger levels to Tel Aviv are between five and six thousand a year.

"Cathay Pacific Airways is to add a fourth daily flight between Hong Kong and the Philippines because of increasing demand, a company spokeswoman has told Reuters.

"The Hong Kong government said it is focusing on negotiating new overflight arrangements with several countries in time for the 1997 handover to China.
Up to now, Hong Kong has come under Britain's traffic rights umbrella. Now it must negotiate its own agreements so airlines can continue to fly over countries on key air routes, the government said.
A spokesman said the countries involved are located on routes from Hong Kong to Europe and to Africa, which are not signatories to International Air Services Transit Agreements with.
He declined to name them or say which negotiations were the most important as overflight fees will also be discussed and more pressure could be brought to bear on Hong Kong's negotiators.
Industry observers said the government is up against the clock to sign the new agreements before next year's handover.
""Some countries will be no problem, others may be sticklers,"" said a source close to the negotiating procedure.
Any proposed deal must be approved by the Joint Liaison Group, the Sino-British body set up to oversee the transition to Chinese rule. The text of a model overflight agreement to be used as the basis for the negotiations was cleared by the JLG in September.
Michael Arnold, who will be Hong Kong's chief negotiator, told Reuters that the negotiations will start as soon as possible with airlines fully involved. He said the agreements which are a form of international treaty will give greater certainty of routes.
""On flights to Europe, for example, given weather and the sometimes unstable political situation in some countries, the airlines need to have access to alternative routes. We need overflight agreements with a number of countries in order to offer several route options,"" he said.
He said overflight rights are now a priority following the successful completion of Hong Kong's final Air Service Agreement (ASA) with the Philippines last week.
""The number one task was to negotiate full ASAs to separate Hong Kong's air services from those previously provided for under the UK ASAs. This we have completed with the initialling of the Philippines agreement. We can now turn to focus on negotiating overflights,"" Arnold said.",0
"HONG KONG, Oct 21 (Reuter) Cathay Pacific Airways said it has successfully handled its first load of pigs destined for breeding in China.
Cathay's in house newspaper said 300 pigs with an estimated value of HK$2.8 million were recently flown from Taiwan to Hong Kong en route for breeding farms in China. It said the eight pallets of swine were housed in two and three deck boxes specially equipped with automatic watering to keep them cool.
""As the pigs have a higher skin temperature than human beings, they are very afraid of heat. That's why we have to sprinkle water on them from time to time,"" Taiwanese herdsman Li Siou Tong told the newspaper.
He said the pigs were valuable breeds including Duroc, Landrace and Yorkshire which had originated in Sweden, the Netherlands nnd the United States. They are now in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen spending 45 days in quarantine before being transported all over China for breeding.
Paulo Chan, Cathay's cargo standards and performance manager, said it was the largest number of pigs yet flown by the airline.

This means more cargo and less fuel can be carried along with a cut in passenger journey times of up to an hour, industry sources said.
Cathay Pacific Airways, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic all say they can begin to utilise the new northern route over China instead of the traditional longer southerly route over Thailand and India in their winter schedules. The short cut was agreed during recent talks between the British and Chinese governments, they say.
A Cathay Pacific spokesman said up to an hour can be cut off the flying time for its Boeing 747-400 aircraft on some European routes which will also have the ability to carry an additional four tonnes of cargo. BA can carry an extra 70 tonnes of air cargo a week if its twice weekly 747-400 aircraft utilise the new routing, its Hong Kong based spokesman said.
A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said the new routing will enable its Airbus A340 aircraft to carry an extra six tonnes of freight westbound and two tonnes eastbound and save around 50,000 pounds of fuel.
Aviation analysts say the new routing offers significant cost saving advantages and allows airlines to carry full cargo loads all year round because strong headwinds during the summer restricts cargo payload.
But they say it is not all good news because the airlines haven't been granted permission for all flights.
""It is fantastic news for the airlines and very influential on the bottom line but realistically Cathay can't utilise the new routes on all flights because it has not been given a full quota and neither have the others,"" Peter Negline, Vice President and senior research analyst of Asia Pacific equity research at Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Limited told Reuters in an interview.
A Cathay Pacific spokesman said it will have the most access to the number of flights that can use the new routing. Other European services to Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt will also be able to benefit as well as London bound ones, he added.
Curfews at both Heathrow and Kai Tak airports will also cause scheduling difficulties until Hong Kong's new, around the clock airport at Chek Lap Kok is due to open in 18 months time, analysts say.
""Aircraft need to leave Hong Kong before the 11.30 pm local (16.30 GMT) curfew starts but the new routing could mean arrival at Heathrow at round 04.30 GMT which is two hours before the end of their curfew so the new routing doesn't offer a lot there,""Negline said.
""You can also see a further deterioration in cargo yields because the airlines are getting extra capacity for next to nothing,"" Negline added.
Negline said the airlines will also benefit from better aircraft and crew utilisation; the aircraft will be able to fly extra sectors and its crew who fly for less hours can be redeployed on other services.
Declan Magee, a Hong Kong based airline analyst for regional stockbrokers and investment bankers HG Asia also said the new routing will obviously benefit aircraft utilisation and fuel efficiency.
""Yes shorter routes will save money but if all three airlines are allowed to do the same thing that rules out competitive advantage. If only one airline could use the new route then it would be different but the consumer will feel the benefit.
Magee said the Hong Kong to London route is Cathay's fourth largest passenger revenue generating route of around HK$1.4 billion a year.
""It is a relatively important route but even if they can save four or five per cent on this route compared to Cathay's total turnover of around HK$30 billion a year.it's not that much. Yes, it's a useful way in which Cathay can offset some of the negatives it is facing in terms of yield decline,"" Magee said.
Analysts reckon the airlines can save around 10 tons of fuel per flight but that may be offset by expected higher overfly fees set by the Chinese who are aware of how much the airlines can save.
Analysts say the airlines need all the help they can get by utilising shorter routes and using new technology such as FANS - Future Air Navigation System which allows aircraft more direct routing. Because of successful negotiations earlier, Swissair and Lufthansa have been able to fly the shorter route over China to Europe for the past two years. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542-7706 Fax+44 171 542-5017",0
"Air Hong Kong Ltd (AHK) chief operating officer, Stanley Hui said the August 25 start of its first trans-Pacific service means the airline is now firmly headed in the right direction.
The head of Hong Kong's only all-cargo airline told Reuters in an interview said it was ""an important milestone towards a much brighter future.""
However Hui said the cargo carrier did not make any money in the first half of 1996 suffering, like many others, from low yields.
Last year AHK made its first ever profit and although Hui would not disclose the exact amount, he said it was ""very healthy"" after ""huge losses"" in the past.
Four years ago, things were so bad that the airline was just a telephone call away from going under, industry sources said.
But then a new management team was installed, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd came to the rescue by taking a 75 percent stake, loss-making routes were cut, old aircraft were retired and three newly converted Boeing 747-200s acquired, Hui added.
The new aircraft are able to carry 25 tons more tonnes than the carrier's old aircraft and complete with a new Chinese wheel company logo signifying brisk business, they began a twice weekly service to Chicago on August 25.
When Air Hong Kong's third converted 747 leased from Cathay Pacific for 15 years joins the fleet in October, the Chicago service will become three times weekly.
Hui says the new route has been possible with the leasing of the three former combi 747s which formerly flew with the Brazilian airline Varig.
The aircraft, converted at Boeing facilities in Wichita, Kansas and at Hong Kong Aero Engine Services Ltd, will give AHK a much higher aircraft utilisation rate from 12 to 14 hours per day.
AHK existing fleet of older 747s are being returned to the leasing company.
""We're talking about more expensive aeroplanes but they're more reliable, with better payload and can help save on maintenance so it's a good investment for this company.""Hui said.
Cathay Pacific has handed its once weekly Chicago service over to AHK in order to concentrate on its own new twice weekly freighter service to New York which also started on August 24.
The new U.S. services have been made possible after a new air agreement was drawn up between the U.S. and Hong Kong government.
AHK also fly to Dubai, Brussels and Manchester five times a week and twice weekly to Osaka. It has applied for a twice weekly service to Seoul in South Korea on Friday.
Hui said there has been a 20 per cent drop in cargo selling rates over the past six months.
""But I'm not surprised, the market is very competive, very seasonal and slow in the first half. We have seen a slower market this year consequently rates have dropped, tonnage is down, rates and yields are down but I think we are seeing a nice recovery. Developing for us and Chicago will help that. It is a very important gateway for us,"" Hui said.",0
"Hong Kong civil aviation department statistics show total air cargo handled in August by country rose by 6.7 percent compared with the same month last year.

"Air Macau said it expects to carry beween 20 and 30 per cent more belly cargo when two more Airbus Industrie A321 aircraft are delivered to serve three new routes into China next year.
Speaking from the Portuguese enclave, Air Macau's cargo supervisor sales and marketing Simon Tang told Reuters the new airline is achieving 60 percent load factors on current available capacity.
Airline statistics show that Air Macau has carried 3091 tonnes of air cargo in the first nine months of cargo operations although during the first two months no cargo was carried.
The figures also show a steady increase from 161 tonnes in January to a high of 489 tonnes in August.
""For a newly established airline I am quite happy to have achieved 60 percent load factors so quickly,"" Tang said.
""Due to the new aircraft arriving next year and the new routes into China I expect cargo carrying capacity to increase by 20 to 30 percent which should be a dramatic improvement."" he added.
The Airbus A321 aircraft on seven year leases will join the airline's four other A321 and smaller A320s which are due to begin flying to three new destinations in China -- Hainan Island, Qingdao and Wuhan, the airline said.
It began flying 11 months ago when Macau International Airport opened and currently serves six destinations with 63 frequencies per week to Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Taipei and Kaohsiung in Taiwan.
The airline said it wants to fly to 22 destinations in the next three years including Australia, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul.
Air Macau also said it expects to carry 30 percent more passengers than forecast for its first year of operation, a total of 650,000. Many use Macau as a staging post for semi-direct flights where they are not required to change planes between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan.",0
"DHL Worldwide Express is investigating whether to have a new Hong Kong operations centre near the territory's new airport, its Hong Kong and China area manager Andy Tseng said.
The proposed centre would be in addition to and complement the express freight centre now under construction at Chek Lap Kok in which DHL has an equity stake.
It would also be in addition to the firm's existing town centre base near Tai Tak airport and its satellite depots across the territory. DHL recently invested HK$15 million in a new automatic handling system able to process 4,000 items an hour at its existing airport base.
""It is a vital decision for our future and a huge involvement. We must make sure we make the right decision for us and for our customer's changing needs in the future. It is difficult and we are collecting as much information as possible on what our customers want,"" Tseng said.
DHL say they have been approached by four real estate developers offering green field sites or existing buildings for conversion in west Kowloon, a mainly industrial area close to the new bridge and motorway link to the new airport on Lantau island.
Other air cargo companies are also reported to be considering off-airport sites because they fear high building rents and staff relocation problems at the new airport.
DHL says a viability study being conducted by a task force should be complete by the end of the year. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017",0
"The newly appointed chief executive officer of Meredith Corp said Monday that the company was beginning to see prices for television stations peak and come down.
That could lead to Meredith making an acqusiiton sometime in 1997, said William Kerr, who is currently president and chief operating officer of the media company.
""We are hopeful that certainly in the course of the next calendar year that we would see some action,"" said Kerr, who will become chief executive January 1.  
In the next few years, Meredith, which owns seven television stations could acquire about five more, he said in an interview.
""I think it may be easier in calendar 1997 than in calendar 1996 to make an attractive acquisition,"" he said, describing attractive as a VHF network affiliate in the 10th to 40th largest U.S. markets. ""We'd like a larger market, but we think it's unlikely one will become available,"" he said.
The Des Moines, Iowa-based company also publishes magazines including Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal.  
He said Meredith will not seek publishing acqusitions, he said. Instead, the company plans to launch new titles, including Family Money magazine, which is expected to be launched in the first half of 1997.
Due to consolidation in the magazine business in the 1980s and early 1990s, ""we do not think there are many acquisitions"" to be made on the publishing side, he said.
Kerr said he did not see another major magazine launch by the time the company's fiscal year ends next June, but said one could be launched later in the calendar year.  
He would not say what the next title would be, but said it would be compatable with the publisher's family focus.
Publishing currently makes up about 54 percent of Merideth's earnings, broadcasting about 43 percent, with the rest coming from licensing, Kerr said.
The company currently has two licensing agreements with Wal-Mart Stores Inc, and Kerr said other agreements are possible, both with Wal-Mart and other companies.
But he also said a new deal is not likely to happen for 12 to 18 months.
""I think it is unlikely that we would have a major new deal to announce in this fiscal year,"" Kerr said.
On Monday, Meredith said its board of directors appointed Kerr chief exectuive officer. He had been president and chief operating officer. Kerr, 55, will replace Jack Rehm January 1, though Rehm will remain chairman until December 31, 1997, when he plans to retire, Kerr said.",0
"Mercury Finance Co is likely to spend a tense weekend with its bankers trying to work out arrangments to solve its liquity crisis, the failure of which could force the company to file for bankrupcty protection, analysts and attorney's said.
The Lake Forest, Illinois-based auto finance company said Friday it could not raise new commercial paper to repay maturing debt and could not pay $17 million in commercial paper due Friday.
A finance company like Mercury makes money on the difference, or spread, between what it pays to borrow money and the higher rates it charges its customers. A finance company without a source of funds is like a retailer without a source of merchandise, analysts noted.
""If you can't fund, you're out of business,"" one equity analyst that follows the company said, requesting anonymity.
Some rating agencies, including Standard & Poor's Corp, lowered Mercury's commercial paper to a default rating Friday.
""They're very close to some reorganization, bankruptcy filing, probably a voluntary reorganization,"" said Thomas Kmiotek, analyst at Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
He and other analysts noted the company has another $100 million in commercial paper due Thursday, February 6.
A Mercury  spokesman did not return repeated calls seeking comment on the company's financing Friday afternoon.
Aside from the company's current inability to sell debt, Mercury is also facing a host of shareholder lawsuits, filed after the company said it had to restate its net income over the past four years by a total of about $90 million because of accounting irregularities.
Lawsuits do not become a financial liability for the company unless there is a judgment in favor of the shareholders. However, the company's admission of misstatements makes it easier for the sharheolders to prove their case, leaving only the questions of who would have to pay how much, one securities lawyer said.
""Securities laws are very, very simple,"" said Ted Koenig, a partner with Chicago-based lawfirm Holleb & Coff ""If there is an ommission or misstatement of a material fact... there's liabiltiy.""
Also, the company's market capitalization plunged by about $2.2 billion Friday, based on the 13 point fall of Mercury's shares and the 172 million shares the company said it had outstanding late last year. That reduces the equity cushion the company has available to show its creditors, Koenig said.
But analysts also said the company had about $1 billion in loans receivable on its books at the end of October, 1996 -- an asset to show creditors.
""No one has questioned the validity of the amount of receivables they have on their books or the quality of those receivables,"" Kmiotek said.
Also, Mercury has generally been well regarded in the sub-prime credit quality loan business, which could help it negotiate with its banks and continue as a going concern, said analysts and lawyers familiar with the company.
Mercury said in a statement it is in discussions with its lenders to satisfy working capital needs, but that it could not predict the outcome of those discussions.",0
"Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc chief financial officer Paul Martin said on Friday the company is not for sale, although it recognizes its responsibility to shareholders.
""The company is not for sale and the company doesn't comment on takeover rumors,"" Martin said in a telephone interview. ""Obviously, we recognize our fiduciary responsibilities."" Stock of the St. Louis-based sporting goods company has jumped more than 50 percent since early December, with market sources pointing to takeover rumors.  
""We keep hearing takeover, takeover,"" said one analyst, who does not follow the stock directly.
Another analyst said he was skeptical there were any takeover talks currently underway.
""I think it's just pure speculation right now, I don't think there's anything happening,"" said Timothy Conder, analyst at A.G. Edwards. He added that, based on fundamentals, the stock, which closed up 1-1/8 at 12-5/8 Friday, has a fair price of 9-1/2.  
In a research report on Thursday, Conder reiterated a maintain/aggressive rating on the stock, saying in the long term, Rawlings brand name makes it an attractive takeover candidate.
One potential acquirer for Rawlings that is repeatedly mentioned is Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike Inc. A Nike spokesperson could not be reached for comment Friday.
Conder said Friday the case for Nike is that it would round out the company's on-field baseball presence. But the case against Nike is that Rawlings is too small and does not have margins that match Nike's.  
Martin said Rawlings is scheduled to report fiscal 1997 first quarter financial results Tuesday, but added the company in November said it expected to report a modest loss for the quarter.
Rawlings said it expected revenues to decline in the quarter because of lower sales in baseballs and baseball gloves. The company reported net income of $890,000, or $0.12 a share a year ago.
Conder pointed out in his research note that the recent settlement of the Major League Baseball labor situation removes a large risk factor.
Major League Baseball is also considering using commemorative Jackie Robinson and Joe DiMaggio baseballs during the 1997 baseball season, which could boost Rawlings business in 1997, he said.",0
"Shoppers lined up outside stores Friday, some arriving before dawn to get an early start on the holiday shopping season.
The day after Thanksgiving is traditionally one of the busiest days of the year for retailers and the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, the make-or-break time for many retailers.
With consumer confidence high and employment strong, analysts are generally expecting sales gains of about 5 percent over last year's weak sales growth. The crunch is especially tight this year, since there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
""The money's there. The confidence is there. The jobs are there. The goods are there and the pent-up demand is there,"" said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Primark Decision Economics. Sinai forecast sales growth of 4.5 percent for November and December, compared with 2.9 percent gains a year ago.
Shoppers also were there, with many retailers offering early bird sales to entice them.
Roni Campos lined up outside the door of the Wal-Mart at first Colony Mall in Sugarland, Texas, a suburb of Houston, at 6:30 a.m.
""You should have seen Wal-Mart. They had a 13-inch television on sale for $99, and people were fighting for those TVs. Arms were flying, and people were just pulling those things off the shelf,"" she said.
Stephanie Foster, of Richmond, Texas, was shopping for baby gifts in Mervyns California, a Dayton Hudson Corp. store chain.
""They had a line outside Target of at least 200 people,"" said Foster, who began her shop-a-thon this year at 5 a.m., shopping list in hand. ""I started out with a list of what everybody wanted and what time every store opened.""
As one of the first customers through the door at Target, she was handed a bag with treats, juice, coupons and mints.
""I came here for a 64 bit Nintendo (for my granddaughters) and they had 40 in stock, but I ended up with two bags of Christmas presents,"" Rosalee DiGregorio said at the Menlo Park Mall in Edison, N.J.
Other items that were expected to be hot this year are those related to the movies ""101 Dalmatians"" and ""Space Jam,"" said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation. Barbie dolls from Mattel Inc. are also expected to be hot sellers, especially Holiday Barbie.
""Believe it or not, Barbie still has legs,"" Mullin said.
The federation is forecasting holiday sales will rise about 6 percent over last year, reaching about $460 billion.
While the the day after Thanksgiving attracts traffic and media attention, actual sales for retailers tend to come later in the holiday season.
""This whole weekend only accounts for 8 percent of purchasing,"" said John Konarski, vice president of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson, said sales volume the day after Thanksgiving is typically three times the retailer's normal sales. That day and the Saturday before Christmas are typically the company's busiest days.
Filene's Basement Corp.'s flagship store in downtown Boston opened at 7 a.m. and was packed with shoppers by 7:30. Filene's Basement Chief Executive Samuel Gerson said the cold weather and a late Thanksgiving were making for a busy season.
At the Falls, a mall near Miami, a small fire on a utility pole nearby cut off power to the complex for about an hour Friday morning.
""We actually ran registers, but off power. Everyone was doing it by hand, doing it by candle light,"" said a spokeswoman for the Bloomingdale's store at the mall. Bloomingdale's is owned by Federated Department Stores Inc..
Norm Allen, head of customer services at the Glendale Galleria in suburban Los Angeles, said the 280-store complex opened at 8 a.m. with about 100 shoppers in line to enter.
""This is going to be a good year. Our volume sales are already up 8 to 10 percent over last year at this time,"" he said.
Apparel and soft goods were expected to lead sales nationwide, while analysts and retailers expect tough competition and a lack of major new items to pressure sales at elctronics stores.
""We'll provide an array of holiday sales,"" said John Costello senior executive vice president of marketing for Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co.. ""Our sales are comparable to last year.""",0
"Mercury Finance Co. got hit by a lawsuit charging it violated securities laws after the auto-loan company said phony bookkeeping entries had inflated its earnings and that it fired its chief accountant.
The stock, which remained halted on the New York Stock Exchange, has not traded since it closed at $14.875 on Tuesday.
The exchange would not indicate where the stock might open but traders said it was changing hands at $4.25 overseas, which would mean a loss of more than $1.8 billion in market worth for the company, based in suburban Lake Forest, Ill.
One of the officers named in the lawsuit was James Doyle, the former controller who Mercury said has not been seen since last Thursday. In its statement on Wednesday, Mercury said it fired Doyle.
Filed in federal court in Chicago on Wednesday, the lawsuit alleges the company and some senior officers misrepresented or omitted crucial information about Mercury's earnings for the last three years, lawyers who filed the suit said in a statement.
The lawsuit also said Doyle had sold tens of thousands and Chairman John Brincat hundreds of thousands of shares of Mercury stock at inflated prices, netting millions of dollars in illegal profits.
Brincat was not available for comment. A company spokesman declined to comment. Attempts to locate Doyle were not successful.
The finance company said on Wednesday its 1996 earnings would be restated to $56.7 million from $120.7 million and that earnings for the three prior years would also adjusted downward, though not as sharply.
The problems appeared to stem from unauthorised entries in financial records by its chief accounting officer, Doyle, the company said.
It also said it was in violation of certain provisions if its loan agreements and that a special committee of directors has been formed to investigate the problems.
Analysts were hesitant to talk about Mercury, saying they did not have much information.
But they did say the company's planned acquisition of Fidelity Acceptance from BankBoston Corp. was unlikely to be completed. The deal, announced on Jan. 10, called for Mercury to issue about $458 million in stock to BankBoston. BankBoston said on Wednesday it was awaiting an audit of Mercury.
""I think the odds are very high that the deal will not go through,"" one analyst said, who asked not to be identified.
Analysts also said Mercury has not been as forthcoming as other consumer finance companies when providing detailed financial information.
Mercury helped pioneer the business of lending to consumers whose credit was less than perfect. It started making loans to people in the military and has grown into one of the country's largest lenders in the used-car market.
""They haven't been quite as open as any others in the industry have been,"" one analyst said.
Two brokerage firms cut ratings on Mercury Thursday.
Gruntal & Co. said it suspended its rating, adding, ""We recommend that holders exit positions as soon as possible.""
Piper Jaffray cut its rating to market performer from buy and in a research report said, ""Our guess is most of the over recognised income came from (Mercury's) insurance subsidiary.""",0
"Firstar Corp's announcement on Thursday that it expected to fall short of analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates for what it believes are temporary factors includes one element -- a continued modest decline in commercial loans outstanding -- that could be a more lasting concern, analysts said.
The Milwaukee-based bank holding company, which has $19.9 billion in assets, said it expects fourth quarter earnings of about $0.95 a share excluding any one-time gains, $0.08 short of the consensus and unchanged from a year ago.  
Firstar is in the midst of a program to trim costs and enhance revenues and said factors including the implementation of that program and assimilation of recent acquisitions would hurt earnings. But the bank also said continued declines in its commercial loans outstanding would also hinder earnings, and was a temporary factor.
""I think while that sounds plausible, it also remains to be proven,"" said Ben Crabtree, banking analyst at Dain Bosworth. Crabtree had forecast earnings of $1.08 a share for the quarter.  
While expenses from the restructuring and acquisitions should eventually be eliminated, analysts were not as sure that the loss of loans would be reversed.
""The question going forward, and that's an unanswerable question, is the long-term impact on the revenue side,"" said Thomas Maier, banking analyst at EVEREN Securities.
Firstar investor relations spokesman Joe Messinger said the decline in loans outstanding is due mostly to the focus on the restructuring during the first two quarters of the year.  
Firstar also said credit card charge-offs will remain higher than the company's historic levels in the quarter, though they will be in line with the industry overall.
""It's something they've indicated in the past,"" Maier said, adding that higher charge-offs were already built into his previous $1.05 a share estimate on fourth quarter earnings and outperform rating on the stock.
In the 10-Q filing with the SEC for the third quarter, Firstar said it expected credit card charge-offs to rise to 4.5-5.0 percent in the fourth and first quarters, before declining to 4-4.5 percent. Charge-offs were 4.06 percent in the third quarter.
If Firstar meets its $0.95 a share estimate for the quarter, 1996 earnings would be $3.34 a share, compared to $3.00 a share a year ago.
Firstar shares fell one to 51 Thursday amid a downturn in banking stocks.",0
"Aiming to fill Americans' seemingly insatiable desire for sport utility vehicles, Chrysler Corp.  and Ford Motor Co.  both introduced new models of the go-anywhere vehicles Tuesday at the North American International Auto Show.
The plush Lincoln Navigator and the brawny Dodge Durango were introduced a day after General Motors Corp.'s unit unveiled an upscale version of its popular Yukon sport/utility vehicle and Subaru of America Inc., a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd  7270T, debuted a new sport/utility based on a passenger car chassis.
Sport/utility vehicles sales climbed to just over two million in the United States in 1996 and are the fastest-growing automotive segment.
The vehicles are so popular that even sportscar maker Porsche AG said Tuesday it also plans to enter the market by the turn of the century.
Although more and more companies are adding more and more models, the market is yet to be saturated, as more drivers foresake cars for the larger vehicles.
""They really are considered substitutes,"" said Diane Swonk, deputy chief economist at First Chicago NBD Corp. ""These are replacing old station wagons. They're also eating very heavily into the luxury car markets.""
Luxury is a key feature of the new Ford and GM models.
Ford's Lincoln Navigator, which is expected to be available in July, includes leather seating surfaces, walnut wood accents and second row bucket seats.
It is expected to be priced in the mid-$40,000 range and will compete at the premium end of the market with vehicles by Lexus and Land Rover. It is aimed at affluent empty nesters or high-profile active families. The target age for Navigator owners is 45-55, said Jim O'Connor, general manager of Ford's Lincoln Mercury division.
The vehicle, which O'Connor expects will sell 20,000 annually, was driven through a mock rock wall and waterfall to make its debut.
The vehicle seats eight, has a 5.4-litre V8 engine with 8,000 pound towing capacity and 116.4 cubic feet of cargo space.
GMC's Yukon Denali, which is scheduled to be in production in  the 1998 calendar year, features four heated seats and a premium sound system, among other accessories.
""We're certainly going upscale,"" Roy Roberts, general manager of GM's Pontiac-GMC division, said when asked about pricing. He declined to comment further.
Chrysler made its typical auto show splash with the introduction of the Dodge Durango, which broke through the floor of a mock-up of the automaker's new headquarters building.
Touting it as a breakthrough vehicle that offers ""more of everything,"" Chrysler said sales could eventually reach 200,000 units. The automaker invested $910 million to bring the vehicle to market.
The Durango, which goes on sale in December, uses the same chassis and beefy front end as the Dodge Dakota pickup truck. It is aimed at a more downscale audience than Chrysler's tony Jeep Grand Cherokee. One unique feature is a rear cargo well sized to fit a hunting rifle.
The vehicle is bigger than Ford's popular Explorer, but smaller than the Yukon, Navigator and Ford Expedition.
Durango features an optional third bench seat, boosting its seating capacity up to eight people.
Despite growing criticism about sport/utilities' poor fuel economy, the Durango offers the biggest engines in its class, including 5.2-litre and 5.9-litre V8s.
Pricing was not announced, but Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz said the Durango could be made with a four-cylinder engine, if necessary.
With so many new sport/utility vehicles entering the market, it is becoming more competitive, which will eventually lead to pressure on margins.
""We'll get saturation if people can't afford to buy these things, relative to the cars they drive,"" said Joseph Phillippi, analyst at Lehman Brothers.
Demand for more affordable sport/utilities will push manufacturers to build them on car platforms, as Subaru, Toyota and Honda are doing, Phillippi said, adding that few drivers travel far off road and don't need the ruggedness and high ground clearance of a truck-based sport/utility.
Executives at the Big Three automakers stress that their new sport/utility vehicles will not compete with existing lines.
""We don't think this will be a major drag at all on Expedition,"" O'Connor said of Ford's current top-of-the-line sport utility vehicle. Instead, he said the Navigator should attract new customers to Lincoln-Mercury.
""I think it will bring a whole new customer to Lincoln,"" he said.
But the automakers also know that if they don't offer sport/utility vehicles in a variety of niches, others will.
""I'd rather have the alternative be in my dealer"" showroom, said Chrysler's Lutz.

"First Chicago NBD Corp, while still open to acquisitions to expand its banking network, expects more retail branches to be cut over time as customers bank electronically or at supermarkets.
""As customers use more and more of those (channels), we've got to take away more of the brick and mortar"" branches, Verne Istock, chief executive, said in an interview Thursday.
But don't expect First Chicago to make drastic cuts like the nearly 280 branches that Ohio-based KeyCorp said last month it would close or sell.  
""I don't think that's the approach we want,"" Istock said. ""I think that's pretty dramatic. I think you're better off to do it on an orderly basis from a customer satisfaction standpoint as well as an employee basis.""
First Chicago has closed about 25 branches since the merger with Detroit-based NBD Bancorp a year ago that created what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States, with $106.7 billion in assets.
But at the same time, First Chicago could be looking to expand its retail customer base through acquisitions of other banks in the greater Midwest.  
""I have publicly said on more occasions than once that this organization does have an interest in expanding through acquisitions where it makes sense for shareholders,"" Istock said.
This means any acquisition First Chicago does could only dilute earnings for a short time, if at all, he added.
But Istock also said First Chicago has not had talks with Milwaukee based Firstar Corp, which has been mentioned as a possible First Chicago target for at least a year.
""We've had no discussions,"" he said of Firstar. He would not comment on other possible acquisition targets.  
Istock also reiterated that an acquisition could be made outside of traditional banking as regulatory lines between banking other financial businesses are erased.
Insurance, investment banking and securities banking are all areas that could be targets of traditional banks, he said.
""We're willing to consider any alternative that we think makes sense for our shareholders first of all and also for enhancing our customer relationships,"" Istock said.
Analysts see First Chicago as having excess capital on its books, which weighs on a bank's performance. EVEREN Securities analyst Thomas Maier said the bank could have more than $2 billion in excess capital, while others estimate a lower amount.
An aggressive 40-million-share stock repurchase plan has helped allay analysts' and investors' concerns about the excess capital. But making a purchase could also put capital to work.
""It's a way of in fact buying your stock back without having to go out in the market to do it,"" Maier said.
First Chicago shares were up 5/8 at 55-1/2 Friday.",0
"First Chicago NBD Corp chief executive Verne Istock expects to see more job cuts at the corporate banking unit as the bank tries to turn around a business that has far underperformed the rest of the company.
""I suspect as part of our restructuring of the corporate bank there'll probably be reduced head count in the corporate bank, and there will be reduced capital allocated to the corporate bank,"" Istock said in an interview.
He would not say how many jobs would be cut.  
The corporate banking unit posted a dismal return on equity of eight percent in the first nine months of the year, compared with nine percent a year ago, with results this year weighed down by a $12 million trading loss. Overall, the bank reported return on equity of 16.9 percent in the first nine months of 1996.
Now the corporate and institutional banking unit is being reshaped, paring back business lines to focus on those central to customer relationships.  
""I firmly believe that something that's chugging along at eight or nine percent can in fact be improved and we fully expect to get it up to that 15 percent or better return"" on equity, Istock said.
Stockholders and analysts appear to accept Istock's argument that the corporate bank's results can only go up.
""You can criticize them, but frankly, it can only improve,"" said Joseph Duwan, analyst at Keefe Bruette & Woods. ""I think they're taking a hard look at the businesses they're in in corproate banking.""  
Istock stressed that increased revenue will come from the corporate bank by focusing on areas that will grow and cutting unprofitable areas.
Already this year, the bank has said it will exit the institutional custody and master trust businesses, two paperwork-intensive lines that would have required major investment to gain significant market share.
Istock also said the bank was trimming its trading operations, again focusing on instruments customers need.  
""I don't think we will have to have the entire (trading) product line or be on the edge of the envelope,"" Istock said. But he added that the types of trading vehicles customers need change.
Istock said he was aware of the corporate bank's troubled performance before First Chicago Corp and NBD Bancorp merged a year ago, forming what is now the ninth largest bank holding company in the United States with assets of $106.7 billion.
Meanwhile, First Chicago's stock hit a post merger high last week, before sliding in a sell off of most bank stocks this week. An aggressive 40 million share stock repurchase plan announced in October has helped boost the stock.
But another area of concern to analysts is credit card chargeoffs, which jumped earlier this year.
Istock said while chargeoffs will likely rise more as the economy slows, the business will continue to be a strong earner for First Chicago.
""It's a business we know, we understand and we plan to stay in,"" Istock said. He added that the bank is beginning to use its 13-million-customer credit card database to sell other products to credit card holders.

"Dutch bank ABN AMRO Holding NV said Friday it agreed to pay $1.9 billion to acquire Standard Federal Bancorp, which owns the seventh-largest savings bank in the United States and the biggest in Michigan.
ABN AMRO, which already has a U.S. banking arm, the LaSalle group, said it was offering $59 a share for Standard Federal, a bank holding company with $15.5 billion in assets based in Troy, Mich.
SFB owns Standard Federal Bank, a large home mortgage lender in Michigan that operates about 180 bank branches and 11 home lending centres. It also operates a wholesale mortgage banking business.
Despite the offer, SFB stock fell after running up sharply in recent days on takeover speculation. Some investors were disappointed the price was not higher, analysts said.
""All the people were really speculating yesterday that it was a lot higher are selling today because they're disappointed,"" said Tony Howard, analyst at Olde Discount Corp.
SFB stock lost $1.625 to $56.375 in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Standard Federal chief lending officer Garry Carley said at a news conference that ABN AMRO had made the highest bid for the bank among several serious suitors.
""We had others who expressed strong interest in the bank,"" Carley told reporters.
ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' leading bank, said it would issue $750 million in preferred stock to help fund the acquisition, its biggest to date. It said it would issue the shares through a U.S. subsidiary, ABN AMRO North America Inc.
Formed in a 1990 merger, ABN AMRO already is the biggest foreign bank in the United States. Its LaSalle group has 130 branches and 7,750 staff members, mainly in the Chicago area.
The agreement marks ABN AMRO North America Inc.'s sixth acquisition in three years and is likely to be the last for a while, ABN AMRO North America Chief Executive Officer Harrison Tempest said at a news conference.
""We're out of the acquisition business for some time now,"" Tempest said. When asked how long before it might make another deal, he said, ""probably two years.""
The combined banks will also be the eighth largest mortgage originator in the United States, ABN AMRO said.
""It gets us into the league we want to be in mortgage servicing and mortgage origination,"" Tempest said.
SFB employs about 4,000 people and serves 1 million clients in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana.
ABN AMRO said Standard Federal's banks will continue to operate under the Standard Federal name and there would be ""significant cost savings"" following the deal.
While saying no jobs would be cut initially, both companies said some job cuts were likely eventually as administrative functions and some branches were consolidated.
With Standard Federal, ABN AMRO North America will have the second largest deposit base in the Chicago market.
Analysts said recent changes in U.S. banking law that will level the playing field between thrifts and banks should help speed other acquisitions of savings and loans.
""I think you're going to see an increased level of activity, both in banks acquiring thrifts and thrifts acquiring thrifts,"" said Jonathon gray, analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co.
ABN AMRO said it had reached agreement with Standard Federal's board, but the deal still needed the approval of its shareholders and supervisory authorities.
The acquisition was expected to be completed by mid-1997, ABN said, adding that the deal would contribute to its earnings.",0
"H&R Block Inc. Thursday reported a big loss for the latest quarter, as its CompuServe online service posted a $58 million loss and became more of a headache to its parent.
H&R Block had a net loss of $74.1 million, or 71 cents a share, in its second quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $8.3 million, or 8 cents a share, in the 1995 quarter. Revenues grew to $253.4 million from $221.0 million.
Kansas City-based H&R Block, the nation's largest tax preparation company, blamed the bad news mainly on losses at its CompuServe unit, the world's second-largest online service, which has failed to sign up new subscribers, especially in the United States.
H&R Block still owns 80.1 percent of CompuServe, after selling the rest of the stock in April in an initial step to spin off the unit.
But plans to complete the spin-off were suspended in August after CompuServe reported poor first-quarter earnings and projected second-quarter losses.
Just nine months ago, shareholders and analysts were pushing for a spinoff, arguing that CompuServe's value was being held back by H&R Block's staid tax business.
Now they want a spinoff because the online services provider is weighing on H&R Block's performance.
""The business model changed for CompuServe in a fairly dramatic way and now CompuServe's valuation is clearly holding back H&R Block's valuation,"" said Martin Romm, analyst at CS First Boston.
""How quickly things change,"" said Dennis Hudson, analyst at George K. Baum. ""What happened was a whole lot of competition came in (to the online market.) The market became saturated before people expected.""
Analysts said H&R Block was waiting for CompuServe's new business strategy announced Thursday -- focusing on the corporate market rather than home users -- to push the unit toward profitability before the spinoff is completed.
H&R Block also cut its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 32 cents, a move that it had previously said would occur after the spinoff was completed.
""Even though the separation has not been completed, the board decided such action was prudent at this time because CompuServe is not adding to the company's profitability,"" said Frank Salizzoni, H&R Block's president and chief executive officer and CompuServe's chairman.
""In taking this action today, the board is indicating it anticipates the separation of CompuServe.""
Both Romm and Hudson said they continue to rate H&R Block stock as a buy and stressed that there was nothing wrong with the company's core tax business.
The company said its Tax Services unit reported a pretax loss of $42.2 million in the second quarter, up $6.9 million a year ago.
""This year's deeper second quarter loss in these core businesses is in large part a result of the company's investments to expand its office network and roll out new products,"" Salizzoni said.
""They're making these investments primarily in new stores that are absorbing costs primarily without any commensurate contribution in revenue,"" Romm said, noting that the tax season does not begin until early next year.
H&R Block stock fell 37.5 cents to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. CompuServe lost 93.75 cents to $10.6875 on Nasdaq.",0
"First Chicago NBD Corp said Wednesday rising bankruptcy filings contributed to a rise in credit card charge offs in the fourth quarter.
Charge offs rose to 6.7 percent of managed receivables in the quarter, compared to 5.9 percent a year ago.
""The fourth quarter increase is due to a combination of factors, including a resurgence of bankruptcy filings after a third quarter lull, an increase in contractual charge offs, and average loan volume that was basically flat in the third quarter,"" chief financial officer Robert Rosholt said.  
But in a telephone message to investors, Rosholt also noted that credit card fee revenue rose 28 percent from a year ago to $259 million, adjusting for securitization.
""Clearly this demonstrates bank card's ability to counter some of the effects of deteriorating credit quality,"" he said.
While the credit card business continues to be profitable for the $104.6 billion asset bank holding company, some analysts noted the charge-off rate was high.
""I think that's very clear that that's not as profitable an operation as it is at other places,"" said James Schutz, analyst at Chicago Corp.  
But other analysts said the bank has tightened credit standards in the past year and were less concerned about the charge-off rate.
""That thing has bounced around all over this year (1996) and it's still a very profitable line of business this year,"" said Robert Ollech, analyst at Principal Financial Securities.
Rosholt also said the bank plans to improve its trading operations to restore results in market-driven revenues.  
Market-driven revenues were $83 million in the fourth quarter, up from $40 million in the previous quarter but down from the bank's average of $100 million a quarter, Rosholt said.
Trading profits were $12 million in the quarter, compared to a $12 million loss in the third quarter.
""We plan to get back to our $100 million per quarter average as we improve our execution of trading activities this year,"" Rosholt said.
Return on common equity was 17.5 percent in the quarter, up from 15.4 percent a year ago, while return on assets was 1.46 percent, up from 1.02 percent a year ago.
Earlier Wednesday, the bank reported operating income of $377 million or $1.14 a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $318 million or $0.96 a year ago.
Earnings were $0.01 a share below estimates, according to First Call. First Chicago shares were up 1/8 at 54-3/8.",0
"McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Monday it would consider mergers and acquisitions, but not a restructuring, after the Defence Department eliminated the company from the race to build a new generation fighter jet that eventually could be worth $200 billion or more.
""We've always been interested in mergers and acquisitions and we continue to look at them,"" Chief Executive Officer Harry Stonecipher said in an interview with CNBC financial television network.
The Pentagon on Saturday awarded four-year contracts to Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. to develop prototype fighter jets for the early 21st century for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and the British Royal Navy.
The decision was a blow to St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, the nation's second-largest defence contractor and a long-time leader in fighter jets, and could force it to restructure, seek a merger or become more acquisition-minded, industry analysts said.
McDonnell Douglas had reportedly had preliminary merger discussions with Boeing Co. earlier this year. Stonecipher would not comment on any specific mergers or acquisitions.
""I don't think Boeing would be on our radar screen,"" he said regarding a possible acquisition. ""We may be on theirs.""
Stonecipher also said he would be interested in trading McDonnell Douglas commercial aircraft assets for Boeing's military aircraft business, but noted there have been no talks in that area. Boeing said it did not comment on rumours or speculation about mergers and acquisitions.
Already the smallest of the three major commercial jet makers, McDonnell said last month it would not continue to compete against Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie in the market for the biggest commercial jetliners.
British and U.S. forces have announced plans to buy 3,000 of the new generation fighter jets, with initial delivery scheduled for 2008.
With potential export sales of another 2,000 jets and additional funding for development and support, the programme could be worth $200 billion to $500 billion over the coming decades, industry executives said.
McDonnell Douglas stock lost $4.25 to $51.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the biggest losers of the day. Boeing rose $1.50 to $93.25 and Lockheed Martin rose $1.875 to $95.625, also on the NYSE.
John Modzelewski, an analyst at PaineWebber, said the decision could force St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to seek acquisitions more aggressively to help build its business, or into a merger with another defence or aerospace company.
""Everything's back on the table,"" Modzelewski said.
In the past year, McDonnell Douglas has been the subject of rumoured talks with Boeing, Rockwell International Corp. and Raytheon Co.
""This will be something of a wakeup call,"" CS First Boston analyst Peter Aseritis said. ""It's a fairly sharp and dramatic blow to McDonnell Douglas and I would venture to guess one they probably didn't see coming.""
PaineWebber's Modzelewski said, ""Without having the internal growth such as joint strike fighter would give them, they're going to have to grow through acquisition."" That could include Texas Instruments Inc.'s defence electronics business, which is for sale, according to published reports.
""Texas Instruments is a very interesting property if in fact it is for sale,"" Stonecipher said in repsonse to a question about the defence electronics business.
In a statement to employees Monday, Stonecipher noted the company's backlog of aircraft orders to the military at home and abroad and said it was pursuing other orders. The company has a $46 billion order backlog, a spokesman said.
""This decision does not mean we are out of the military aircraft business,"" Stonecipher said.
McDonnell currently builds the Air Force F-15 fighter and the Navy-Marine F-18E/F as well as the C-17 military cargo plane. Both the F-15 and the F-18 are to be replaced by the joint strike fighter in the next century.",0
"The U.S. economy should provide a repeat in 1997 of the steady growth seen in 1996, which should also lead to car and truck sales near 1996 levels, according to economists who work for the Big Three automakers.
Economists for Ford Motor Co and General Motors Corp both forecast vehicle sales between 15 million and 15.5 million in 1997, while Chrysler Corp's economist predicted sales of 15.2 million. Sales were about 15.4 million in 1996. The forecasts were made in a presentation to the Society of Automotive Analysts.  
""We are likely to see more of the same,"" Chrysler's W. Van Bussmann said, echoing the view of the other two analysts.
""We see no significant changes in either direction on fiscal or monetary policy,"" said G. Mustafa Mohatarem of General Motors.
Ford's Martin Zimmerman was even more optimistic. ""I frankly don't see why this growth can't continue into 1998,"" he said.  
But that does not mean the auto industry has no concerns. The one short-term worry all three economists voiced was the weakening of the yen, which fell to about 117 to the dollar Monday from about 106 a year ago. A weaker yen makes Japanese imports, including automobiles, less expensive in the United States.
That, in turn, makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market, giving Japanese automakers more flexibility in pricing, analysts said.  
But the analysts all expected political or market pressures to cause the yen to stabilize and then strengthen somewhat against the dollar this year.
""We should see the yen start to strengthen,"" Zimmerman said.
Bussmann forecast the yen at 106 to the dollar by the end of 1997.
In western Europe, analysts see continued economic pressure associated with the move to European union in 1999 continuing to weigh on the economy there and keep vehicle sales about flat.  
But Mohatarem argued that there is a possibility for a positive surprise in central Europe, saying Russia could achieve three percent economic growth by 1998.
Mexico was also seen as an area for growth, with that economy recoverying quicker than expected from the recent peso crisis, analysts said.
Meanwhile, Bussmann argued that capacity usage for truck production will remain at about 80 percent through the year 2000 and that truck demand as a percentage of total vehicle market share will continue to rise.
""We see the light truck demand reaching 50 percent (of total vehicle demand) by just past the turn of the century,"" he said.
But other analysts were not as optimistic about demand for light trucks, which generally have higher profit margins than cars.
""I don't think it will reach 50 percent of demand,"" said Thomas Webb, chief economist with the National Automobile Dealers Association.
During his presentation, Webb also said his forecast for 1997 auto sales was on the low end of a range he defined between 14.7 million and 15.1 million autos.",0
"Retailers looking for a post-Christmas rush to boost lukewarm holiday sales may be disappointed as snow in some areas and holiday exhaustion kept many shoppers from bargain-hunting Thursday.
""I think people did their shopping"" before Christmas, said John Konarski, vice president at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a group of retail mall operators that surveys 85 large regional malls across the country.
""You're going to have some people out today (but) you're not going to see the massive crowds some people expected.""
Konarski said he expected that holiday season sales would be up 4 percent to 6 percent from a year ago, which is about what he expected before the season began.
But after strong activity in the weekend following Thanksgiving, retailers' hopes for even better sales ended up being dashed by a slowdown in the week before Christmas.
""I think generally, the overall picture appears to be we had a good, solid holiday sales period, but not a spectacular one,"" said Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, which represents major store chains.
She said she expects holiday sales rose about 5 percent from last year, when gains were a weak 2.5 percent to 3 percent.
Store officials and analysts said that while sales were coming in at or just below retailers' expectations, that still beats the dismal results last year.
""They slowed up very moderately, actually, from the input we're getting,"" said Jay Meltzer, managing director of LJR Redbook Research. ""You know, we didn't go over a cliff and a year ago we did go over a cliff.""
In Chicago, snow and cold weather appeared to be keeping crowds down in the Michigan Avenue shopping district the day after Christmas.
""Sales today are relatively slow compared to before Christmas,"" said Julie Towson, manager of the Knot Crazy tie store in Water Tower Place. ""I think a lot of people spent all of their money before the holiday. Also, who wants to come out in this kind of weather?""
In central New York State, where it was also snowing, Konarski said there were lines at malls before stores opened at 7 a.m. EST (1200 GMT), but most shoppers were looking for markdowns on holiday accessories and to return merchandise.
In Cleveland, many workers were on vacation and some offices were closed, and shopper traffic at the Tower City Center mall complex was moderate.
""We've had a good, strong season,"" said the manager of a women's clothing store who has worked in retailing 11 years. ""Business today is pretty good. Volume is moderate.""
At Tower City's AnnTaylor store, sales associate Mary Rogonjich said Thursday morning traffic was slow but she expected things to pick up during lunch hour.
""Things have been steady this morning, and we have not had that many returns,"" she said. ""We've had a very good season -- above plan."" The store was offering up to 50 percent off on silk blouses, pants, jackets, shoes and other items on Thursday.
In Miami, some shops were seeing more traffic.
""The store is very busy. Really everything is marked down,"" said a spokeswoman at Federated Department Stores Inc.'s Macy's store in Miami's Falls mall.
But analysts said that while promotions picked up before Christmas and would accelerate this week, special discounts were fewer and less steep than last year, which should help retailer profits.
""Some retailers did get promotional in the last few days,"" Mullin said. ""I think you'll see it really starting today.""
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said in a telephone message for investors on Monday that discount and warehouse sales were at the low end of plan for the holidays in the third week of December.
The company is in line for sales increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for November and December, the company said.
Dayton Hudson Corp. said on Tuesday sales were meeting expectations and that the company had planned its inventories well.
Sears, Roebuck and Co. said overall sales and sales at stores open at least a year were showing upper-single digit increases.
""Overall sales were strong the last three days before Christmas,"" Vice President of Marketing John Costello said, noting that clothing, tools, jewelry, multimedia computers and tires sold well.",0
"Sears, Roebuck and Co. Thursday said earnings jumped 24.6 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong sales and improved profit margins during the Christmas selling season.
""We ended the year with excellent fourth-quarter results, which are even more impressive given the strength of last year's fourth quarter,"" Sears Chairman Arthur Martinez said in a statement.
December included the company's first ever back-to-back billion-dollar sales weeks, he said. The Christmas season is crucial for retailers since store chains typically earn half or more of their annual profit during the period.
""They had a great 1996 capped off by the best Christmas of any department store operator,"" said Alan Rifkin, analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc. He noted that Sears' sales at comparable stores rose 9.5 percent in December.
The nation's second-largest retailer said earnings rose to $567 million, or $1.42 a share, in the quarter, from $455 million,  or $1.13 a share, in the 1995 period. Sales grew 10.8 percent to $12.04 billion from $10.87 billion.
The earnings beat Wall Street forecasts that averaged $1.38 a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.
But Sears' stock fell $2 to $49.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, mostly on profit-taking.
""The stock was up strongly early in the week and I think people are just taking profits,"" Rifkin said.
Analysts said Sears gained from its decision to remodel some stores and expand its clothing offerings.
""Clearly they're gaining market share and clearly they're doing the right thing and the consumer likes what she sees when she goes into the store,"" said Karen Sack, analyst at the S&P Equity Group.
Operating income from domestic operations rose 14.8 percent to $531 million in the quarter as revenue rose 11.6 percent to $10.92 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 5.4 percent for the quarter.
Operating income from domestic operations for all of 1996 rose 20.9 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenues increased 10.2 percent to $34.85 billion.
Gross margins as a percent of merchandise sales rose to 27.9 percent from 26.9 percent in the 1995 period.
Rifkin said margins were not likely to rise as much in 1997 as in the fourth quarter, but said cost-cutting should drive earnings growth this year.
He forecast earnings at $3.60 a share in 1997 and $4.25 a share in 1998, up from $3.12 a share in 1996.
International operations, including merchandising and credit operations in Canada and Mexico, earned $36 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $7 million in the 1995 period.
The increase in earnings was largely attributable to improved performance at both Sears Canada and Sears Mexico, lower selling and administrative expenses at Sears Mexico, and writeoffs of Sears Canada properties in the year-ago quarter, it said.
Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., operates more than 800 department stores and 2,500 other stores offering clothing, home and automotive products and services.
While earnings rose in the quarter, they fell for the year, in part because 1995 included a gain of $776 million from the former Allstate Corp. subsidiary, which was spun off to Sears' shareholders in June 1995.
For all of 1996, Sears earned $1.27 billion, or $3.12 a share, in net profits, down from $1.80 billion, or $4.50 a share, in 1995. Sales grew 9 percent to $38.22 billion from $35.0 billion.",0
"As the world's first Internet bank, Atlanta-based Security First Network Bank has had somewhat of an identity problem with potential customers.
""We get a lot of questions,"" Chief Executive Officer James Mahan III said. ""Are you real? Are you virtual? Where are you really?""
Part consumer bank, part software testing site, Security First opened its virtual doors a year ago this month.
But now Security First plans to add actual doors, opening small offices in Atlanta, Cambridge, Mass., and Silicon Valley in California.
""I think we can more effectively market if we have a physical presence,"" Mahan said in an interview.
Comparing his bank to discount brokerage firm Charles Schwab & Co., Mahan said having the offices may give customers a sense of security, even if they never use an office.
Security First's current location is on the Internet. The bank is one of five in the United States that operates directly on the Internet, according to the Bank Administration Institute.
Federally insured Security First can be accessed at Website (www.sfnb.com), which brings consumers to a home page that looks like a bank lobby.
Customers can reach their account anywhere they have access to the Internet, rather than being tied to a single terminal where they have finance software, like other computer banks.
""Our goal was to have a bank that was fully interactive, where an individual could see all his information,"" Mahan said.
Most Security First customers have a money market account and a demand deposit account. Customers can open a checking account with as little as $100, an amount most choose to start to make sure the bank works, Mahan said.
Customers can pay bills electronically, purchase certificates of deposits or acquire a Visa card. Security First is also hoping to offer brokerage products and first and second mortgage products by the end of the year. Funds can be accessed by automatic teller machine, and Security First absorbs interbank fees for using the machines.
With limited infrastructure, Security First can offer higher yields, Mahan said. The bank was offering a six-month CD with an annaul percentage yield of 5.9 percent.
Security First was spawned as an idea of Mahan, who was chief executive officer at Kentucky-based Cardinal Bancshares Inc., and his sister-in-law's husband, Michael McChesney, who was starting a security software firm.
""He educated me on the Internet for years and years and years,"" Mahan said. Mahan used the charter of one of Cardinal's thrifts, changed its name to Security First and used it to start the Internet bank.
McChesney's, firm, SecureWare Inc. developed software that Mahan said has military-grade security. So far, the bank has not had its security breached, Mahan said.
""That doesn't mean that there haven't been a number of sophisticated attempts,"" he said. ""If you have enough money and enough time you can break into anything.""
Outsiders agree that Security First has shown a record of being secure, avoiding viruses, data theft and other potential dangers of Internet commerce.
""They do use a level of security that the Pentagon reserves for its most secure and sensistive systems,"" said Paul Schmeltzer, executive vice president for network services at Southeast Switch Inc., the corporate organisation for the Honour Network, the fourth largest ATM network in the country. ""Is any security design totally foolproof or totally secure? Probably not.""
That software and others developed for the bank is likely to be the prime money maker for Security First. Mahan admits that Five Paces Inc., Security First's software unit, will be the prime contributor to the company's net income.
""The bank is really a test site to use as a demonstration for potential customers of the software business,"" said Gary Craft, an analyst who follows the bank for Alexandria, Va..-based Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.
Security First's stock is traded on Nasdaq.
Security First has opened about 5,600 accounts. Most of its customers are male, between the ages of 25 and 45, with average income above $63,000 a year. More than 80 percent own their own home, attractive demographics for marketing.
Security First has also attracted competition. This month, Atlanta Internet Bank opened for business.
Unlike Security First, Don Shapleigh, chief executive of Atlanta Internet, says he does not plan to open any customer offices. ""I have the WorldNet. I have other ways to get out."" Federally insured Atlanta Internet currently offers its services to subscribers of AT & T's WorldNet Services.
Shapleigh also argues that Atlanta Internet is the first true Internet only bank, saying that Security First is really a software company.
""I'm not selling software,"" he said. ""I'm a banker.""

Homeland shareholders may choose to exchange each of their shares for either about 1.55 Magna shares, a comparable amount in cash or a combination.
Magna said it will repurchase about 600,000 shares of the stock, under its current repurchase plan.
""We certainly will consider buy back programmes beyond that, but nothing has been approved beyond that,"" G. Thomas Andes, Magna chairman, said in a news conference.
Waterloo, Iowa-based Homeland, with assets of $1.2 billion as of June 30, owns and operates four commercial banks and one savings bank and provides financial services through a network of 33 locations in Iowa.
Magna, with $5.35 billion in assets, is the third-largest banking institution in the St. Louis metropolitan area and the nation's 95th largest banking company. It has 106 banking locations throughout Illinois and Missouri and a trust and brokerage company.
After the acquisition, Magna would have about 55 percent of its assets in Illinois, 25 percent in Missouri and 20 percent in Iowa, Andes said.
The deal is subject to approval by Homeland shareholders and regulators.
Magna said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings within 12 months, and save about $8 million through centralization of systems and procedures.
Some of the cost savings will come from job cuts, though those cuts could come from attrition, Andes said.
Homeland Chief Executive Erl Schmiesing said during the news conference that cuts were underway at Homeland in any case as it consolidated.
Magna will continue to consider other acqusitions, possibly in Iowa, Andes said.
""We certainly like the state of Iowa,"" he said. ""We would certainly welcome the opportunity to expand in the state of Iowa, as well as Illinois and Missouri.""
Magna is also among several Missouri-based banks considered by analysts to be likely acquisition targets, a perception that did not change with the Homeland acquisition announcment.
""It certainly doesn't make them any less attractive or likely as a takeover candidate,"" said Steven Schroll, a banking industry analyst at Piper Jaffray.
Homeland's stock rose $1.75 to $35.75, while Magna edged down 6.25 cents to $24.81 Tuesday on Nasdaq.",0
"Mercantile Bancorp Inc's planned $1.07 billion purchase price for Roosevelt Financial Group Inc and an expected merger-related charge of $25-$30 million after tax both appear reasonable for an in-market deal, analysts said Monday.
The St. Louis-based bank holding company said it expects to take the charge in the quarter the deal closes.
""For a deal this size, I think, it's probably relatively modest,"" analyst Steve Schroll at Piper Jaffray said.  
Roosevelt, a $9 billion thrift holding company also located in St. Louis, has 83 branches, 73 of which overlap with Mercantile, Schroll said.
The banks told analysts they expect to eliminate 50 of the overlapping branches by the middle of 1998, he said, adding that Mercantile also expects to cut 37 percent of Roosevelt's pre-tax cost base by 1999.
In a news conference, Mercantile would not specifically say how many branches would be shut.  
The cost reductions help justify the $1.07 billion price tag, which is about 11 times 1997 earnings estimates for Roosevelt, Schroll said.
""It's reasonable,"" Schroll said. ""For an in-market deal, because of the opportunities to save costs, it's reasonable.""
With its recently announced plan to acquire Mark Twain Bancshares Inc for $855 million, Mercantile will be the largest financial institution in Missouri, with $30 billion in assets once both deals close.
That could make Mercantile, often mentioned as a takeover candidate, even more attractive.  
""I'd say Merc was already attractive anyway,"" said Joseph Stieven, a banking analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, which advised Roosevelt on the deal. ""This makes them no less attractive.""
Joseph Roberto, a banking analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods, said, ""I think it makes Mercantile more attractive. It gives them the number one market share across the state.""
But the process of closing the two deals, expected in the second quarter, and absorbing the acquisitions could take Mercantile out of play as an acquisition target in the short term, analysts said.
""I would think in the short term, an acquisition of this size, when combined with the acquisition of Mark Twain, probably delays the likelihood of somebody from outside coming in to buy Mercantile,"" Schroll said.
Meanwhile, St. Louis-based Magna Group Inc and Kansas City, Missouri-based Commerce Bancshares Inc could become more attractive for suitors looking to buy in the Missouri market, analysts said.",0
"Caterpillar Inc chief financial officer Douglas Oberhelman said Tuesday that an increase in U.S. dealer new machine inventories at the end of 1996 was intentional.
""It's higher than it was a year ago and that's by design,"" Olberhelman said in an interview with Reuters. ""As it turned out last year, we didn't have enough inventory in dealer hands and this year we will, we hope,"" he said.
Some analysts expressed concern Tuesday at the increase in inventories.  
The Peoria, Illinois-based heavy equipment maker Tuesday reported record net income of $381 million or $1.99 a share for the fourth quarter, up from $300 million or $1.53 a share a year ago and $0.11 ahead of consensus estimates.
But the company's outlook that the 1997 profit level would ""approximate"" that of 1996 appeared to be pushing the stock lower Tuesday.
Oberhelman defended the company's view of slowing U.S. economic growth in the face of analysts' comments that the view was too conservative.  
""We're trying to call it as we see it,"" he said. ""I will tell you that a year ago, we called for a softer economy in the U.S. and it didn't happen. We were pleasantly surprised.""
He added that the company is prepared to increase production if demand is stronger than expected, as it did in 1996.
After focusing the last several years on improving operations, Oberhelman said the company now thinks it's time to increase spending on research and development and on capital assets to improve shareholder value in the future.  
Total capital expenditures were $642 million in 1996 and are expected to rise 10 to 15 percent in 1997, while research and development is expected to rise 20 percent from the $410 million spent in 1996, Caterpillar said.
""It's going to be a little bit of everything,"" he said when asked if the expenditures would be focused on acquisition or internal development.
He said the company is likely to continue its pace of about 50 new or upgraded product introductions a year through 1999.
One area the company is looking to gain in is power generation equipment, a $5 billion worldwide market Caterpillar sees tripling in the next several years.
""We'll still be building there, both internally and through acquisitions,"" he said.
Caterpillar shares were down 1-3/4 at 76-3/4 Tuesday.

"Third seed Boris Becker on Thursday withdrew from the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open due to a recurring injury to his right wrist.
Becker, who tore a ligament in the wrist during a third round match at this year's Wimbledon, trained on Thursday morning, but afterward complained of pain in his wrist.
He later told ATP officials that he would not play his second round match against Czech Martin Damm later on Thursday.
""Boris said his wrist was too sore and that he would not be able to play this evening,"" ATP Tour Supervisor Gayle Bradshaw told Reuters. He did not elaborate.
On Wednesday evening, Becker cruised to an easy 6-3 6-4 victory over Denmark's Frederik Fetterlein.
During the match he held his wrist several times, and appeared to be favouring it again at practice on Thursday morning. Becker immediately left the training court for his hotel. He was not available for comment
""I have good days and bad days with my hand...it was sore in the match but I managed to fight through it and hopefully it will be alright tomorrow,"" Becker said after the match on Wednesday.
The world number six tried to return to the circuit last month, but recurring problems with the wrist forced him to retire from the first round in Bucharest, lose in the second round in Basle and withdraw from Lyon two weeks ago.
Becker's withdrawal puts a serious dent in the 28 year old's plans to qualify for a record 12th appearance at the ATP Tour Championships at the end of the year. He currently trails South African Wayne Ferreira, seeded second in Ostrava, by only 46 points for the eighth and final spot in Hannover.
It also comes as a blow to tournament organisers. Though he was only ranked third in the tournament behind top seed Goran Ivanisevic and Ferreira, it was clear most of the tickets sold were by fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the German.
Barely 1,000 fans came out to watch Ivanisevic's first round match against world number 42 Adrian Voinea. In contrast, a tournament record crowd of some 10,000 watched Becker defeat the Fetterlien, ranked 156 in the world.",0
"Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
Early results showed candidates of Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) ahead in the few constituencies declared so far but without the majority of the vote needed to win outright, meaning they will face the runner-up in a second round.
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec, an ODS vice chairman, welcomed the results but warned supporters against overconfidence. ""I'm very happy that several of our candidates have moved into the next round,"" he told reporters.
But he added: ""I warn you, add up all the votes for all of the candidates and think how they will go in the second round. The situation is not as rosy as it may appear from the numbers of ODS candidates that are moving into the next round.""
With three of the 81 constitunecies officially declared, the striking statistic was the turnout figure which ranged from 26.36 percent in the northern mining town of Most to 29.78 in one constituency in the industrial city of Ostrava.
One official of the Central Electoral Commission, Ales Kaspar, forecast that turnout nationwide would be by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism. ""According to optimistic expectations, the turnout could be between 30 and 40 percent,"" he told Reuters.
This suggested the real winners might not be ODS or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate polls and told Czechs to follow suit.
Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.
""I would like to remind all voters who criticise our country that by not voting they do not have the right to criticise the government. They have only the right to criticise themselves,"" said Zeman, who is speaker of the lower house.
But he added: ""I firmly believe that in the second round, participation will be markedly higher because then it is a choice between the two strongest candidates,"" he said.
Share dealers welcomed signs that ODS, which has led free-market reform in recent years, would do well.
""The early results appear pleasantly good for ODS. To me, if these continue, it could be a good result for the market,"" said Jan Sykora of Prgaue brokerage Wood and Co.
Pundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June.
But the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.
Sladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it ""would be lazy, useless and expensive"".
One complaint among voters was that many of the Senate candidates were unknown as government and opposition leaders all sit in the lower Chamber of Deputies. Few Czechs have much idea of what the Senate will do.
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.
But Jiri Pehe, research director at the Open Media Research Institute (OMRI), said these theories may not be valid.
ODS is better at mobilising its supporters than the Social Democrats when interest is low. A big ODS win on a low turnout might therefore not be representative for lower house polls.
""If there is a low turnout, even if Klaus wins, I think that it would be very difficult for the ODS to know the real mood of the country,"" he said.",0
"The Czech trade deficit jumped sharply in October, rising nearly 16 billion crowns, but analysts said they were not alarmed by the rise which is inline with their full year forecasts.
The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) said on Tuesday the trade gap for the first 10 months of the year hit a record 125.5 billion crowns, up from a revised 109.6 billion crown shortfall for January-September.
The CSU, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and most analysts, however, have predicted the deficit -- accelerated by an economic slowdown with the country's main trading partner, Germany -- will finish at a record 150-160 billion crowns.
""The figures are developing according to forecasts. It's clear that the year-end deficit will be 150-160 billion crowns,"" said Kamil Janacek, chief economist at Komercni Banka.
""I'm not surprised by the jump since the economic revival of Germany will only show up in export growth in the first half of next year, not in one or two months,"" he added.
The CSU in a statement said that imports rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year for the 10-month period, down from 15.2 percent for January to September, while exports rose by 5.2 percent, down from 5.9 percent for the first nine months.
It added that strong growth in machinery and transport equipment imports continued, growing by 19.1 percent year- on-year and accounting for 38.3 percent of total imports.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the rise in this sector, saying that imports of this nature are needed to restructure industry, allowing it to produce more competitive goods for exporting.
""The trend seems unchanged. The financing of future economic growth is being done with imports, especially in the heavy machinery sector,"" Boris Gomez, an analyst at ING Barings told Reuters.
Added Martin Kupka of Patria Finance:""The country is still clamoring for machinery and raw materials which are necessary for industrial restructuring.""
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, a monetarist-economist, has said the record trade deficit is ""not tragic"" saying it has come in part from a temporary foreign investment wave.
The Czech crown reacted indifferently to the trade figures, hovering around three percent above its dollar/mark basket parity, where it was for most of Monday.
The crown was trading at 26.919 to the dollar at 1230 local time (1130 GMT).
The rate implies a deviation from the midpoint of the currency basket of +3.09 percent, after the central bank's fixing on earlier on Tuesday at +3.00 percent.

"Top seed Goran Ivanisevic cruised to a 7-6 6-4 win over Romania's Adrian Voinea in the first round of the Czech Indoor Open on Monday.
In the only other match involving a seeded player on the opening day, Britain's Tim Henman overpowered Sweden's Nicklas Kulti 7-6 6-4.
Both players took advantage of the fast carpet court, blasting service winner after service winner to demoralise their opponents.
Ivanisevic, ranked fifth in the world, started slowly against world number 42 Voinea, before pulling away in the middle of the tie break and never looked back.
""It's always tough to play in a new hall and the carpet here is much faster than last week in Vienna,"" said Ivanisevic who hit 14 aces.
""But this was good preparation though because the tournament has so many top players. To win it will take at least one win over a top 10 player.""

"A strong showing in runoff Senate elections at the weekend may breathe new life into the Czech governing coalition, but it will do little to resuscitate the country's dormant capital market, analysts said on Sunday.
The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats.
The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June.
But analysts said that while the news could have been worse for investors, the strong centre-right showing does nothing to solve the maladies which continue to plague the market.
""I think the market's reaction will be fairly positive, but in a few weeks time it will probably have settled down into acknowledging that this has not changed the situation of the past four or five months at all,"" Charles Robinson of the research house HILFE told Reuters.
""It has just not made it worse,"" he added.
The coalition's strong showing in the first round of voting last week helped spur domestic investor interest, pushing the market up in its wake.
Analysts said, however, that with this fillip already built into prices, stocks will probably not rise too much further in the near future.
The Czech crown also gained some ground against its dollar/mark basket on the back of the first round results, but it too should not rise significantly on the final outcome of the vote, they added.
""It seems that the final results of the elections reflect the current structure of the political situation here so I don't expect any significant changes or amy development as a result of it,"" said Miroslav Nosal of Patria Finance.
Analysts said that until legislation is tightened to bring about more market transparency and stronger minority shareholder protection, key foreign investor interest will remain low.
""I think there has been a result built into the market from the good Senate results last week, and everyone expected that the coalition would win this second round,"" said one analyst.
""There are still other difficulties that will keep the market relatively depressed such as a lack of regulation that will keep foreign investors away. This is a more important issue over the medium-term than the Senate elections.""",0
"Czech share prices rallied following the coalition government's win in weekend Senate elections, but analysts said the rise is due more to a technical correction than a change in investor sentiment.
The Prague Stock Exchange's PX50 index rose 0.86 percent at the bourse's daily price fixing, spurred by gains to seven of the eight most-capitalised shares.
Brokers, however, were muted in their optimism that the rally would last more than a few days, saying the centre-right government's strong showing was expected and already built into the market last week.
""Basically, this is a technically-led rally, I don't think it has a basis to do with Senate elections,"" said Jay King of the brokerage Wood and Company.
Added another local trader: ""You're not seeing real volumes here you're just seeing prices being pushed up in anticipation of year-end, and without a doubt it is domestically driven. Foreigner investors are still on the sidelines.""
The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats.
The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June.
But a thin turnout -- just over 30 percent of the electorate cast their ballots -- made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters' hearts.
The Prague bourse has been hard hit in recent months -- falling some 17 percent since September -- with most investors shying away from the a market characterised as opaque at best, and little regard for minority shareholder rights.
And analysts said that the election would probably not bring about a new push for changes to securities laws within the coalition, a condition that is necessary to lure back participants.
""I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring in changes,"" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.
""I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.""

"Czech telephone operator SPT Telecom a.s. on Thursday reported a nine-month gross profit of 6.0 billion crowns, in line with forecasts, and said outlays for investment rose significantly in the period.
""The figures were basically in line with our estimates. Margins are pretty much the same as they were in the first half so I think the company is in a good position for future growth,"" said Alex Marcek an analyst at Patria Finance.
The company's gross profit for all of 1995 was 7.0 billion crowns. SPT used International Accounting Standards in calculating its profit.
In a statement, the company said revenues  totalled 23.3 billion crowns, nearly equal to the 26.4 billion crowns for 1995.
SPT said outlays for investment in the nine-month period exceeded 20 billion crowns or more than the total for 1995.
A Dutch-Swiss consortium of PTT Netherlands and Swiss Telecom, which bought a 27 percent stake in SPT from the government last summer, has effective day-to-day control of the firm. The consortium paid $1.32 billion for its stake.
SPT said it installed more telephone lines in the Czech Republic in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date figure to 272,000 lines. SPT now has a total of 2.67 million lines.
""The company is confident that it will achieve its 1996 target of over 400,000 new set lines,"" the statement said. The company is aiming to increase its network by another 500,000 lines in 1997, and 650,000 in 1998.
SPT is the only telephone line operator in the country. There are also two GSM mobile phone operators, but they do not install hard lines.
""If they hit the target of 400,000 new lines it would be a pretty good base as far as revenues are concerned,"" said one local telecom analyst.
SPT shares closed down six crowns at 2,879 in after-bourse trading in Prague.
The company didn't comment on its dividend policy. SPT has said in the past that it doesn't plan to pay a dividend before 1998.",0
"The party of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took a solid lead in Senate election run-offs on Saturday, but turnout was dismal despite an appeal to vote from President Vaclav Havel.
With almost half the 81 constituencies declared, Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) had won 19 seats in the new upper house, ahead of the opposition Social Democrats with eight.
The Christian Democrats, a junior partner in Klaus's centre-right coalition, put in a strong perfomance to take seven while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) won two.
Turnout was just 30.5 percent, lower even than the 35 percent recorded in the first round of the Senate polls on November 15 and 16, the Central Election Commission said.
Before the second round, Havel appealed to Czechs to turn out in far greater numbers for the sake of the credibility of the new upper house.
The Senate elections had been billed as key to the future of Klaus's coalition, which lost its lower house majority in elections six months ago. But analysts say that with turnout so low, the Senate results have little significance.
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, an ODS member, forecast that the government parties would take control of the Senate.
""It is clear that the coalition is leading at the moment and I think they still will be after the final results are out,"" Kocarnik told reporters, predicting that the ODS would win between 33 and 40 seats.
Analysts had forecast that voter apathy would benefit the ODS which is well-organised and well-funded by big business.
Its supporters, largely more affluent Czechs who have benefited from Klaus's free market reforms since the 1989 fall of communism, have been galvanised by the coalition's loss of its majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies in June.
Klaus, an architect of economic reform, repeatedly accused the Social Democrats of conspiring with the little-reformed communists to turn back the clock on reform.
Scepticism is widespread among Czechs and Klaus himself has questioned the need for the Senate, which was written into the Czech Republic's new constitution when Czechoslovakia split at the end of 1992, but is only now being elected.
The Social Democrats have said they would scrap the Senate if they ever achieved the three-fifths majority in the lower Chamber of Deputies needed to change the constitution.
Klaus toned down his scepticism as voting neared but only Havel has appeared enthusiastic about the idea.
Before the run-offs -- for the top two first round candidates in constituencies where no one won more than half the vote -- Havel appealed to citizens to turn out in much greater numbers for the sake of the Senate's legitimacy.",0
"The three-party coalition of right-wing Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus won a majority of seats on Saturday in run-off elections to parliament's new upper house, the Senate.
But the premier's own party won fewer seats than expected after dominating the first round last week and voter turnout was dismal despite an appeal for Czechs to cast their ballots from President Vaclav Havel.
With all 81 constituencies declared, the coalition parties secured 52 seats in the Senate, the very existence of which many Czechs have questioned.
The result marked a turnaround for the coalition, central Europe's last centre-right government, which lost its majority in the more powerful lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, six months ago.
Klaus's own Civic Democratic Party (ODS) won 32 seats ahead of the strongest opposition party, the Social Democrats, with 25.
The Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, took take 13 seats while the third party in the government, the Civic Democratic Alliance, won seven.
The little-reformed Communists clinched two seats and two went to independents.
""I welcome the fact that the governing coalition took two-thirds of the senatorial seats, and that's a huge victory over the opposition,"" said Klaus, who sits in the lower house along with all other government ministers.
""The result in the second round isn't any surprising victory, but on the other hand the real fact that ODS has about 40 percent of the senators I would have to mark as successful.""
The Central Election Commission reported that second round turnout was around 30 percent, lower even than the 35 percent registered in the first round held on November 15-16.
The centre-left Social Democrats, whose strong gains in June lower house elections stripped the coalition's majority, were saved the embarassment of a Senate dominated solely by their arch-rivals from Klaus's party.
""I am pleased that Senate will be a place of democratic discussion, and never the place of arrogant domination of one or another political party,"" Milos Zeman, the chairman of the Social Democrats and the lower house, told reporters.
Zeman's party has been beset by internal bickering since June, but the results of the run-offs -- between the top two first-round candidates in constituencies where nobody won more than half the vote -- could have been worse for the opposition.
""Most importantly the Senate won't be one-coloured or two-coloured as was expected, but multi-coloured,"" said analyst Jiri Pehe of Prague's Open Media Research Institute.

"Czech paper concern Sepap Group a.s. on Friday said its nine-month net profit fell as a shutdown of its main paper mill, coupled with a downturn in the paper cycle bit into its bottom line.
Sepap said its nine-month net profit, calculated according to international accounting standards, fell to 188.4 million crowns ($7 million) from 520.4 million over the same period in 1995, while revenues slumped to 3.94 billion crowns from 5.34 billion.
The firm said results from the third quarter only had stabilised after a first half industry downtrend, though ""the planned annual shutdown of the Steti mill lowered earnings by virtue of the expected higher maintenance costs associated with the stoppage"".
""Overall, Sepap year-end earnings are expected to rise and show a slight improvement over third quarter levels,"" a company statement said.
The Steti mill, which accounts for some three-quarters of the group's revenues and profits, saw its pre-tax profits plummet to seven million crowns.
Comparative figures were not immediately available, but the mill's nine-month 1995 gross profit was some 95 million crowns.
""The market place is sending mixed signals for the fourth quarter. Anticipated price increases have not taken hold at the anticipated levels in all of the pulp and paper grades,"" the statement said.
It added that the group's second biggest subsidiary, newsprint maker ROTO, ""continued to produce good results in a market that is weakening"".
ROTO showed a nine-month pre-tax profit of 149 million crowns on sales of 1.25 billion crowns.
Last year, Sepap was the centre of a heated battle for control between Bahamas-based investor Michael Dingman and Swedish forestry concern Assidoman.
Dingman, who controls 48 percent of Sepap through his Daventree Ltd investment company, won the battle, but later accepted Assidoman's role as a strategic partner in the paper industry. The Swedish firm holds a 39 percent stake in Sepap.",0
"Senate runoff elections on Friday and Saturday should have little impact on Czech capital markets, as investors focus on macroeconomic fundamentals rather than political influences.
Analysts said last weekend's first round of voting gave a mild boost to the Czech crown and the Prague Stock Exchange, and unless results from the second round of voting on Friday and Saturday vary greatly, little further movement should be seen.
""Provided that nothing drastic happens, it's pretty much a non-starter from a foreign investor point of view. I think that for the markets, it will be pretty much a non-event,"" Jay King, of Wood and Company, said on Thursday.
In last weekend's voting, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic Party (ODS) posted a strong result, capturing over 36.5 percent of the national vote, an increase of some six percent from June lower house elections where his coalition lost its majority.
The opposition Social Democrats (CSSD) were second with 20.3 percent. The rest of the vote was thinly split among coalition parties and the Communists.
Only 35 percent of the electorate voted in the elections.
Of the 81 Senate seats, the ODS won three outright in the first round and 76 of their candidates were to go into the runoff, compared with 48 for the CSSD. In 47 constituencies, the runoff is a straight fight between the two main parties.
Analysts said that with the two main parties assured of dominating the Senate, a body which will have limited powers anyway, little change appears imminent for the country's economic, or political course.
""Our expectation is ODS gaining somewhere around half of the total, and including the rest of the coalition it might be well over 50 seats. I don't think there should be any surprises,"" said Radek Maly, an economist at Citibank Prague.
Following last weekend's vote, the PSE, mired in a two month long slump began to edge higher, gaining some four percent over the week.
But dealers said the gains were based more on weak local buying than a change in sentiment from key foreign investors.
The crown too, ratcheted up slightly after the first round of voting, but has since steadied at 2.9 percent stronger than its dollar/mark basket midpoint.
Some analysts said foreign investors might be tempted, as they were the previous week, to play on a strong Klaus victory early on Monday, but any gain based on the political situation would be short lived.
""There may be some bias toward a stronger Czech crown,"" said Petr Korous, a dealer at Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka. ""There's no other factor, more or less the basic impulse for that (a stronger crown) was really because of the elections, and then the subsequent recovery of the capital markets.""
Citibank's Maly added: ""I wouldn't foresee any major changes in the fixed income market. The fixed income market is rather less sensitive to these political events than is the FX (foreign exchange) market.""",0
"Germany's David Prinosil ended rising British star Tim Henman's bid for his first ATP Tour victory on Saturday, while Czech Petr Korda halted compatriot Martin Damm's quest for his second final appearance in two weeks.
Prinosil beat Henman 6-4 6-3 in the semifinals of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open and Korda followed with a hard-fought 4-6 6-3 7-5 victory against his Davis Cup team mate.
Seventh seed Henman, who had not lost a set all week, looked shaky on his groundstrokes early, but stayed in contention with his strong serve, firing seven of his 11 aces in the first set.
But in the 10th game of the match, Henman's serve failed him, his double fault giving the German triple break point.
Henman, who has now reached seven semifinals but never gone further, fought back with a service winner and then an ace, but as he has done all week, Prinosil blasted a brilliant return to take the point and set.
The British number one recovered to gain two break points of his own in the third game, but failed to come up big when he needed to.
Prinosil, who was born near here in Olomouc before emigrating to Germany, then took control.
Henman said: ""I didn't serve well at the right times. I felt confident coming into the match, (but) I just didn't really make anything happen today. It was just a case of not really having a good day at the office.
""I'm disappointed to have lost because I thought it was a good opportunity to make my first final. Bar this match, I've played very well this week and am confident going into Stuttgart and Paris.""
Prinosil said: ""I served very strongly today and just tried to play within myself, not get too excited and lose my concentration. No matter what happens tomorrow, this tournament has been a great success for me.""
Damm also looked on the bright side, viewing his appearance in the final last Sunday in the Beijing Open and this week's march to the semifinals as two of the best weeks of tennis he has ever played.
Victimns on the way have included world number three Michael Chang and ex-Wimbledon champion Michael Stich.
For Korda the win came as a relief following claims in the local media that he could no longer hold his nerve in big matches.
The former world number five has suffered several injuries in the past two years, dropping to 49th in the rankings.
""I felt a lot of pressure at the beginning of the match and I've never seen Martin play that well, but I think I also showed that I am still capable of playing tennis at the highest level,"" said Korda, who won his first tournament in two seasons at the Qatar Open earlier this year.",0
"The Czech Republic and Spain played to a scoreless draw in their World Cup group six qualifier on Wednesday, in a lacklustre match that failed to live up to its marquee billing.
The Czechs were facing their first big test since they reached the Euro 96 final, while Real Madrid's teenage striker Raul Gonzalez was looking to spark a depleted Spanish attack in his first cap.
Both sides opened their World Cup campaigns last month with high-scoring victories over the two weakest teams in the group, Spain winning 6-2 in the Faroe Islands and the Czechs thrashing Malta 6-0.
But Yugoslavia have already collected three wins and Slovakia two against the same two hapless victims and neither team could afford to give ground in Prague.
Like two heavyweights feeling each other out in the early rounds, both teams started tentatively, waiting to pounce on the other's mistakes.
The Spaniard's were the first to flinch when Kaiserslautern striker Pavel Kuka's cross found an unmarked Karel Poborsky just outside the crease. But the Manchester United midfielder failed to control the ball, wasting what would turn out be one of the game's few good scoring chances.
Next it was the Czechs turn to falter. Newcastle United goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek, making his first cap in over a year, tried to clear the ball, but hit attacker Alfonso Perez and watched helplessly as it rolled just wide of the net.
The Czechs picked up their play in the second half, putting Spain on its heels for the rest of the game.
But veteran Valencia goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta held his ground on Pavel Kuka's dangerous turnaround blast from just outside the penalty spot, and then robbed Jan Suchoparek in the dying minutes of the game, stopping the midfielder's drive from three metres away to keep the game scoreless.
""I don't think we lost points tonight because they are such an excellent team. They played strongly in the backfield and its too bad we missed out on the two great chances we had,"" said Liverpool sensation Patrik Berger.
Added Spanish coach :""Raul played very well and I'm pleased with our team. Both teams could have one this match, and I'm content with the result though we would have liked to have taken three points.""
Teams:
Czech Republic - 1-Pavel Srnicek, 2-Radoslav Latal, 3-Jan Suchoparek, 4-Pavel Nedved (15-Martin Frydek, 86th), 5-Miroslav Kadlec, 6-Michal Hornak, 7-Jiri Nemec, 8-Karel Poborsky (17-Vladimir Smicer, 58th), 9-Pavel Kuka, 10-Patrik Berger, 11-Radek Bejbl
Spain - 1-Andoni Zubizarreta, 2-Abelardo Fernandez, 3-Sergi Barjuan, 4-Rafael Alkorta, 5-Miguel Angel Nadal, 6-Fernando Hierro, 7-Raul Gonzalez, 8-Luis Enrique Martinez, 9-Guillermo Amor (18-Ismael Urzaiz, 76th), 10-Julen Guerrero (14-Josep Guardiola, 52nd), 11-Alfonso Perez (15-Roberto Rios, 73rd)",0
"A Czech central bank scheme to buy doubtful debts of smaller banks and restore stability to the banking sector has attracted interest from about 10 banks, the Czech news agency reported on Wednesday.
CTK, quoting central bank spokesman Martin Svehla, said that of the 13 banks allowed to participate in the plan, the number that had expressed an interest in joining ""is nearing 10"".
Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) outlined the programme in mid-October followed the failure of Kreditni Banka in August -- the 11th bank in which the CNB had intervened -- and the politicisation of the case which had undermined confidence especially in small banks.
Under the plan, participating banks must follow strict conditions and allow the central bank to make management changes where needed. CNB officials said the programme was not aimed at resolving a problem at any one bank.
The plan will be open to all small private banks with total paid-in capital of 12.5 billion crowns ($458.5 million) and total assets of not more than 30 billion crowns.
The state-run Konsolidacni Banka would buy the banks' doubtful assets at face value.
The banks will be required to buy back the assets after around five to seven years, again priced at their nominal value, minus credits recovered by Konsolidacni from the debtors in the meantime.
Banks seeking to participate will be held to strict requirements which include sticking to a three-year stabilisation plan and an agreement to attain an eight percent capital adequacy ratio.
Banks also must maintain cost controls, profitability and liquidity as well as agreeing to frequent reviews by the central bank.
The maximum purchase of debt by Konsolidacni can total up to 110 percent of a single bank's paid-in capital, meaning a maximum exposure for the state of 13.7 billion crowns in total if all eligible banks participated.
The programme is voluntary based on a contract with the CNB, and the central bank said it would not reveal which banks elected to participate.
Banks eligible include Ekoagrobanka, Union Banka, Evrobanka, Prvni Mestska Banka, COOP Banka, Pragobanka, Plzenska Banka, Foresbank, Bankovni Dum Skala, Moravia Banka, Universal Banka, Zemska Banka, and Banka Hana.
Money for the scheme is to come primarily from state- controlled Konsolidacni Banka and if necessary from the CNB itself. A newly created unit of Konsolidacni, Ceska Financni s.r.o., will administer the programme.
Any losses from the programme are to be covered by the National Property Fund (NPF), the state privatisation agency.",0
"Czech shares rallied on Monday following the coalition government's win in weekend Senate elections, but analysts said the rise was due more to a technical correction than to a change in investor sentiment.
The Prague Stock Exchange's PX50 index rose 0.82 percent on the day, spurred by gains to seven of the eight most-capitalised shares.
Brokers, however, were muted in their optimism that the rally would last more than a few days, saying the centre-right government's strong showing was expected and already built into the market last week.
""Basically, this is a technically-led rally, I don't think it has a basis to do with Senate elections,"" said Jay King of the brokerage Wood and Company.
Added another local trader: ""You're not seeing real volumes here you're just seeing prices being pushed up in anticipation of year-end, and without a doubt it is domestically driven. Foreigner investors are still on the sidelines.""
The minority coalition of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus took 52 of 81 seats in the newly-created upper house of parliament, following the second round of voting, well ahead of the centre-left opposition Social Democrats which took 25 seats.
The Senate is a mostly advisory body with limited legislative powers, but the election was the first test at the polls for Klaus since his coalition lost its lower house majority in general elections in June.
But a thin turnout -- just over 30 percent of the electorate cast their ballots -- made it hard for the three-party coalition government, which lost its lower house majority in June, to claim it had recaptured voters' hearts.
The Prague bourse has been hard hit in recent months -- falling some 17 percent since September -- with most investors shying away from the a market characterised as opaque at best, and little regard for minority shareholder rights.
And analysts said that the election would probably not bring about a new push for changes to securities laws within the coalition, a condition that is necessary to lure back participants.
""I'm a little sceptical about the possibility that the Senate will help bring in changes,"" said Pavel Sobisek of Zivnostenska Banka.
""I think there will be a lot of pressure from market participants on the government to do something...but I have not seen any signs of a change in attitude of the coalition with respect to this topic.""
Analysts said that the market should take some heart however, in statements made by Klaus following the vote when he said he saw no reason to call early elections for the lower house, which should keep the market stable in the near future.",0
"Britain's Tim Henman emerged on Friday as the only seed in the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open semifinals.
Seventh-ranked Henman overcame second seed Wayne Ferreira 6-4 6-3.
But fifth seed Todd Martin was edged out by Germany's David Prinosil 7-6 7-6 and sixth seed Michael Stich lost to Czech Martin Damm 5-7 6-4 6-4.
Czech Petr Korda completed the final four with his 6-1 6-0 demolition of Davis Cup team mate Jiri Novak and now faces another Davis Cup player in Damm. Henman plays Prinosil in Saturday's other semifinal.
Reigning Ostrava champion Ferreira, ranked seventh in the world, never looked comfortable against Henman, the more aggressive of the two for most of the match.
He failed to gain a single break point all match while the Briton broke serve late in both sets.
Henman's win avenged his loss to the South African in Toronto earlier this year, and he said he had taken notes from that match on to court on Friday.
""In Toronto, Ferreira was dictating the points -- serving very well and hitting forehands very well -- so today I tried to be very aggressive and, when I had an opportunity, move forward,"" said Henman, ranked 26 in the world.
Local favourite Damm, a finalist at the Beijing Open last week, spoiled Stich's 28th birthday. After losing the first set the Czech scored crucial breaks in the ninth game of the final two sets.
For Martin, defeat was especially painful as he could have gained valuable ground on Ferreira in the race for the final spot at the ATP Tour championship in Hanover at the end of the season.
The American currently sits 199 points behind the South African. A semifinal berth would have eaten 37 points out of that lead while a place in the finals would have almost halved Ferreira's advantage.
Prinosil, ranked 58th in the world, profited from a Martin double fault at 5-5 in the first set tiebreak and took a 4-0 lead in the second set tiebreak on the way to sealing victory.
Martin said: ""I realise I didn't help my cause at all but we've got two of the biggest tournaments coming up and I think whoever does really well in those events should probably play themselves into a position at Hanover.""
Martin, Stich and Ferreira both appear next week in Stuttgart, where the winner gains 370 Tour points, 200 more than the winner here.
The German tournament's organisers said on Friday they expect Boris Becker will be fit to play, despite a wrist injury which forced him to retire here.
In a move to accommodate Becker, his first round match has been put back to Wednesday.",0
"Germany's David Prinosil, in a homecoming of sorts, overwhelmed Czech Petr Korda 6-1 6-2 in the final of the $475,000 Czech Indoor Open on Sunday.
The 23-year-old German, who was born near here in Olomouc and emigrated to Germany when he was 14, took control of the match from the beginning, keeping Korda off balance with his booming serve and crisp groundstrokes.
As was the case all week, Prinosil used his deft return of service as an offensive weapon, seizing on both break points he had to take the first set in just 22 minutes.
It was more of the same in the second set, with world number 49 Korda taking more chances, but failing to unsettle the German, who was playing in only his second final on the tour after he won in Newport last year.
Korda was on the verge of breaking Prinosil in the fourth game, but the world number 58 blasted four straight service winners to take the game, and then ripped two crosscourt forehands to break in the fifth and seventh games in a match that lasted just 50 minutes.  
""If someone told me I wouldn't lose a set all week, I would have said they were crazy. I don't think I have ever played this well,"" said Prinosil, who enjoyed straight set victories over Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, American Todd Martin and Briton Tim Henman on his way to the final and a prize of $64,000.
Korda said: ""I was a little drained from yesterday's match and he hit the ball well. The points were short, which gave me little chance to take control of the match.""
Korda needed two hours late on Saturday to defeat Davis Cup team mate Martin Damm in three sets while Prinosil beat Henman in just 56 minutes.",0
"Czechs cold-shouldered their newly-created Senate on Saturday, turning out in record low numbers for elections which were supposed to be a key test for the minority government of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
The apathy suggested that the real winners might not be Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS) or the opposition Social Democrats, but the far-right Republicans who boycotted the Senate elections and told fellow Czechs to follow suit.
Unofficial figures from the two-day first round, which ended on Saturday, indicated that turnout would be well under 40 percent, by far the lowest in the four parliamentary elections held since the 1989 fall of communism.
Opposition Social Democrat leader Milos Zeman bewailed Czechs' apathy towards the upper house, but predicted that turnout would improve in the second round on November 22-23.
""I think that no party can be happy with the low election turnout, because people that don't turn out for the Senate elections are giving up their civic rights, the right to vote, the right to decide,"" Zeman told reporters.
No national figures were available immediately after the polls closed at 2.00 p.m. (1300 GMT).
But preliminary, unofficial data from some of the 81 constituencies showed Klaus's centre-right ODS doing well against a bleak background on turnout.
In the Western city of Plzen, turnout was just 36 percent with the ODS candidate expected to face a Social Democrat in the second round, the Czech news agency CTK reported.
If no candidate wins more than half the vote in the first round, the top two candidates go through to the runoff.
In the northern mining town of Most, turnout was 26 percent with the ODS candidate leading trade union leader Richard Falbr, who is running for the Social Democrats.
Pundits have billed the Senate elections as an indicator of whether the Czech Republic can break out of a political impasse following inconclusive lower house polls which stripped Klaus's conservative coalition of its majority last June.
But the apparent low turnout, which compares with 76.4 percent in June, seems a vindication of the Republicans and their leader Miroslav Sladek.
Sladek regards the Senate as a waste of time and money. ""They had nowhere to dump the political zombies so they established the Senate,"" he told a recent anti-election rally, adding that it ""would be lazy, useless and expensive"".
Conventional wisdom has been that if ODS did well in the Senate Klaus might provoke early lower house polls to regain the coalition's majority. If ODS lost to the Social Democrats, however, he could be forced to resign after seven years leading economic reform as finance minister and since 1992 as premier.",0
"Sweden beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in a World Cup ice hockey game on Thursday, setting up a showdown for European group supremacy against Finland and leaving the reigning world champions searching for answers.
The fast-skating Swedes seized control of the game from the opening faceoff, forcing the Czechs to take several early penalties and keeping its vaunted offense in check.
Toronto Maple Leaf winger Mats Sundin opened the scoring midway through the first period when he sped around the Czech defense and pulled Dallas Stars' goalie Roman Turek across the crease before sliding the puck between the netminder's legs.
The Swedish National Hockey League (NHL) connection struck again early in the second frame when Washington Capital defenseman Calle Johansson blasted a slapshot from the blue line past a screened Turek with only 57 seconds gone.
Turek, voted best goalie at the world championships for the past two years, was once again screened when a weak shot from Jonas Bergqvist found the bottom corner of the net to close out the scoring for the undefeated Swedes.
The Czechs came into the tournament riding high after capturing the world title in Vienna in May, but have lost the first two games of the tournament and are in danger of crashing out despite having their version of the ""Dream Team"".
With the addition of Pittsburgh Penguins duo Jaromir Jagr and Petr Nedved, Montreal Canadiens sharpshooter Martin Rucinsky and the core of the world championship team in tact, the Czechs were looking to prove they belonged at the pinnacle of the hockey world.
The match at Prague's Sports Hall was to be a homecoming of sorts for the Czechs, their first home game since beating Canada 3-2 in a thrilling world championship final on a last minute goal.
But after a demoralising loss to Finland in its tournament opener on Tuesday, and another listless effort on Thursday, Czech fans had had enough, pelting the Czech bench with beer cans near the end of the game.
Even Czech coach Ludek Bukac, a veteran coach with almost 30 years behind the bench, was left searching for an answer to his sputtering offense and the team's lack of dynamism.
""The Swedes played well, you've got to hand it to them. But the fact that we didn't score at home is not a very good showing,"" he said.
Added Jagr: ""We aren't that bad, but our performance is not showing it.""
Bukac, who has often expressed his disdain for bringing in players who have talent but not team spirit refused to comment on whether he would invite the same team back if he could do it all again.
But with nine players on the roster with seven or less of national team games under their belts, the Czech players know they must come together quickly, or face the embarassment of failing to win in what is touted as the true battle for hockey supremacy.
""We've got to concentrate on winning against Germany and moving on to the next round, nothing else,"" added Robert Reichel, who recently re-signed with the Calgary Flames after playing one year in Germany.
The win allows Sweden to keep pace with group leaders Finland, who have also won both their games so far but have a better goal difference.
The two teams meet on Sunday in Stockholm while the Czechs must regroup and beat winless Germany in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on Saturday to move into the quarterfinals next week in North America.",0
"Home decorating giants ICI Paints and Black & Decker hope their new product to be launched on Wednesday won't make a splash.
The two companies have invested two years and millions of pounds in developing the Black & Decker Paintmate, a battery-operated roller system they claim will take the pain out of painting.
The Paintmate, which will be sold in DIY (do-it-yourself) stores across Britain from April for 39.99 pounds ($65), uses an air-filled bellow system to squeeze the contents of a two-litre refill bag of Dulux paint down a tube and onto a roller, with the flow controlled by a trigger.
The small, cylindrical Paintmate can be strapped on to the back to eliminate tiresome bending over. Black & Decker spokesman Richard Sanderson told Reuters, ""It is a long time since the DIY market saw a product of such significance.""
Sanderson said the companies hoped to sell 500,000 of the British-designed, Chinese-made Paintmates in the first full year in Britain, together with a million bags of paint.
If all goes well in Britain, which Sanderson said was ""quite a sophisticated DIY market"", Paintmate will be rolled out across western Europe next year, after which attention would switch to the huge U.S. home improvement market.
ICI, which sells enough paint in the UK to decorate five million homes a year, hopes the product will revolutionise the way people decorate.
""It's quick, it's easy and I think people will find it fun,"" said ICI Decorative Paints international marketing director Chris Harris.
Harris said the whole system could be flushed out with water. ""We think people would redecorate more regularly if the painting process was quicker and easier,"" he added.
The Paintmate's promoters hope to benefit from a surge in DIY sales, fuelled by an upswing in Britain's temperamental housing market.",0
"Two very different Cambridge biotechnology companies set out their plans to join the stock market on Monday.
Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc (CAT), which uses human antibodies to discover new drugs, and the Bioscience Innovation Centre, which aims to ""incubate"" new biotech businesses, both hope to raise millions of pounds to fund their work.
Sources close to CAT said its listing later this year should raise between 30 and 35 ($48-57 million) through a placing of its shares with institutional investors, valuing the company at around 85 million pounds.
Kleinwort Benson Ltd has been appointed as sponsor to the flotation, with Cazenove & Co as broker.
CAT, which has been operating since 1990, is working to find drugs to tackle inflammation, fibrosis, cancer and obesity.
It said two drugs were expected to enter human clinical trials this year. CAT plans to develop drugs on its own up to intermediate stage clinical trials, and then find partners to help fund the costly business of late-stage trials, registration and marketing.
The strategy would enable the company to keep a higher percentage of profits from drug sales than if it introduced a partner early on, but will also increase its costs.
The Bioscience Innovation Centre (BIC) said it hoped to raise up to 6 million pounds through a share placing and open offer, and to list its shares on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).
The money will go towards the construction of a 20,000 square foot building in Cambridge which will act as a ""business incubator"", offering technical and commercial skills to budding biotechs.
""In the U.S, sector-specific business incubators have been shown to have a positive and dramatic effect on the success rate and growth of start-up businesses,"" BIC said.
It added that the planned centre would give suitable companies access to ""professionals in the fields of intellectual property, commercial management, licensing, marketing, regulatory affairs and finance.""
Teather & Greenwood have been appointed as advisers and brokers for BIC's flotation.",0
"Daewoo Cars Ltd, the British motoring arm of Korean conglomerate Daewoo Corp, is considering transferring its unique UK marketing strategy to new markets.
In an interview with Reuters at this week's British International Motor Show in Birmingham, Daewoo UK Ltd managing director Tong Won Rhie said: ""We are now reviewing the performance over the past two years, and the UK strategy has proved a good model.""
He said adapting the policy of cutting out car dealerships by selling directly to customers, which has rapidly carved Daewoo a significant slice of Britain's highly competitive car market, ""is a big possibility.""
Daewoo already operates in 12 European countries and is preparing to launch its models, which are revamped versions of old General Motors Corp cars, in five more.
In its first nine months of operation in Britain last year Daewoo sold more than 13,000 cars. And by October 8 this year Rhie said it had already sold another 18,500 units.
""Our target when we launched was one percent market share in three years. We have already reached that,"" Rhie said.
Daewoo, which likes to advertise itself as breaking the mould of car supply in Britain, launched itself through cleverly targeted publicity, including surveys of customer likes and dislikes.
Rhie summed up customers' pet hates as ""too much hassle"" from salesmen and poor aftercare once the sale was complete.
""It is like a wedding, with the customer as the bride. Before, they say I love you, darling,' and all that, but after the marriage they forget,"" Rhie said.
Daewoo was the first company to offer three years' free servicing on all models and packed its cars with extras including airbags and mobile phones.
It has also led a revolution in all-inclusive pricing, a trend followed this week by GM unit Vauxhall Motors and by Porsche AG with its new Boxster sports car.
But Rhie said its U.K. strategy was not applicable to all markets, particularly those where the relationship between car producers and dealers is even more entrenched than in Britain.
""The UK market is more sophisticated than many other countries. The level of (consumer) awareness is higher.""
Daewoo has encountered severe criticism from rivals, some of whom are alarmed at the speed with which it has penetrated the British market, where it has overtaken longer-established names like Saab, Mitsubishi and Hyundai.
Some question whether its pioneering servicing agreement with the Halfords superstore chain can provide the level of support for customers that it claims.
Daewoo's response to criticism that its current range of models is outmoded will be to launch three entirely new cars at the end of 1997. Rhie said one of these, known as the J Car, had been developed largely by its U.K. R&D operation in the southern town of Worthing, which employs nearly 1,000 people.
Rhie declined to state Daewoo's next target for U.K. market share. ""Quantity is very important but that is not the final goal,"" he said. ""Our aim is a customer focus and how to continuously follow up customers' requirements.""",0
"New evidence about British Biotech Plc's anti-cancer treatment Marimastat next week will provide important clues about its potential as a blockbuster product, analysts said on Friday.
British Biotech is using a meeting of the European Society of Medical Oncologists (ESMO) in Vienna to make five presentations, including Marimastat's effects in ovarian, colo-rectal, pancreatic and gastric cancer.
It will issue a general update on Monday morning.  
The Oxford-based group has become the bellwether for the increasingly crowded biotech field in the U.K, with sentiment towards Marimastat having a disproportionate impact on the sector.
Millions of pounds of investors' money has been placed on the bet that Marimastat will turn out to be Europe's first big-selling biotech product, with forecasts for annual sales ranging from a few hundred million dollars to up to $4 billion.  
Monday's data comes from patients who continued to use the drug beyond the period necessary for completion of Phase II clinical trials. The company said this meant there would be a further six months of extra information.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said he hoped to see the first hard evidence that patients were living longer as a result of taking Marimastat. Refsum said the surrogate marker data provided so far was like ""the indicator board at the train station rather than the train actually coming.""  
In a note on the trials Lehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith, who will attend the ESCO meeting, said it might be possible to glean indications of the effect of Marimastat on patient survival in ovarian and pancreatic cancer.
There will also be interest in Marimastat's impact on gastric cancer, where little information has so far been available. And analysts are keen to see how serious the side effects caused by the drug are. The main problem reported so far is joint pain.  
Yamaichi's Refsum said the results are ""not definitive as  to whether it works or not, but it is another indication as to whether it will sell or won't sell, and that is the bottom line."" Lehman's Smith added that the results ""won't prove Marimastat's efficacy but will raise the probabilities.""
British Biotech will announce late-stage data on another key product, pancreatitis drug Lexipafant, on November 27.
Smith said that favourable news on both drugs could lift the group's share price to 300 pence by the end of the month from 230 at Friday's close. But Refsum is more sceptical about the potential impact of Marimastat and said 150 pence is ""reasonable value"" for the shares.
A British Biotech spokeswoman said Phase III Marimastat trials are likely to take two years to complete, meaning that the first results would not be available until 1998 at the earliest. But she said British Biotech would probably make academic presentations at conferences like ESMO from time to time to keep the market up to date.
Late stage trials on pancreatic cancer started in June, and trials in small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer and a form of brain cancer are being set up, she added.",0
"Shares in perennial bid favourite Zeneca Group Plc spiralled higher once more on Thursday, but analysts said it was on the thinnest of pretexts.
The stock touched a new record of 17.25 pounds during the morning session, with the rise once more triggered by speculation about the intentions of Swiss drugs giant Roche Holding AG. -- hotly tipped by takeover theorists as the only company rich enough to buy Zeneca.
News that Roche had named Franz Humer as chief operating officer combined with talk in the press that Humer is keen to ensure Roche does ""not play second fiddle"" to his old employer Glaxo Wellcome fuelled the latest rise, traders said.
With few people willing to sell Zeneca stock in case they miss out on any takeover, which could be worth $30 billion, the stock is being continually squeezed higher.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST) analyst Peter Laing said Zeneca shares, which have gained 37 percent this year, are now at ""eye-popping"" levels. SGST believes that a hostile bid is implausible at current valuations, and, without this, the stock's current rating is increasingly hard to justify.
""Is it valid for a stock which is only two-thirds a drug stock and the rest agro-chemicals and specialty chemicals to be on the same premium as Pfizer?"" said Laing, who argued that the current gains are a story of ""supply and demand.""
Cash-rich Roche is widely believed to want to make a large acquisition, both to reassert its position as number one in Switzerland and to counteract the shortfall in new drugs coming through the industry's pipeline.
But some analysts and industry executives believe that Zeneca would not necessarily be its chosen target.
One industry source said he believed Roche would be much more interested in the U.S. company Schering-Plough Corp, which had a similar market capitalization to Zeneca. He said Roche had eyed Schering Plough on a number of occasions.
Schering-Plough would offer Roche a much stronger footing in the key U.S. market than Zeneca, and it would plug gaps in Roche's existing infrastrucure, offering the Swiss group badly-needed muscle in the non-hospital and U.S. over-the-counter sectors.
However, analysts said Zeneca had a more attractive pipeline of new drugs than Schering-Plough. And as the world's second-biggest cancer drug company after Bristol Myers Squibb Co it would also boost Roche in a key therapeutic area.
""I am quite sure that at the right price several companies would like to acquire Zeneca,"" said Panmure Gordon analyst Robin Gilbert, adding that good quality medium-to-large businesses like Zeneca and Schering-Plough are few and far between.
But Gilbert said Zeneca, which is ""firing on all cylinders"" since its split from chemicals group ICI Plc in 1993, is determined to remain independent.
""They believe they have a future as an independent company, and obviously they don't agree with the size philosphy of people like Glaxo Wellcome,"" Gilbert said.",0
"British health and industrial gases giant BOC Group Plc reported its best-ever set of full-year profits on Tuesday, dispelling some of the gloom which has settled over its share price in recent months.
BOC, one of the world's biggest suppliers of specialist gases, saw profits surge 11 percent to 444.9 million pounds ($745 million) despite problems caused by a stronger pound and a deterioration in the performance of its health-care business.
Sales climbed seven percent to just over 4.0 billion pounds.
The outcome was at the top-end of analysts' forecasts, which had been pared down after BOC issued cautious noises about its two non-core operations, health and industrial vacuums, along with third-quarter results on August 13.
Shares in the group, which have fallen from more than 940 pence since mid-June and touched 12-month lows on Monday ahead of the results, climbd 29 pence to 865 in early afternoon trading.
Industrial gases, which are used in industries as varied as foods, chemicals, metallurgy and water purification, saw operating profits rise nine percent to 408.3 million pounds on sales up 6.8 percent to 2.8 billion pounds.
In an interview with Reuters, chief executive Danny Rosenkranz said he expected profit margins in gases to improve by about two percentage points over the ""next three to four years"" from the 14.5 percent achieved in the year ended in September.
He said a major factor behind the improvement would be the huge increase in the number of 15-year supply contracts BOC has won in the U.S, which entail building gas-making plants next to customers such as steel works in return for guaranteed sales.
The Ohmeda health division, hit by continued falls in the price of BOC's once top-selling anaesthetic gas Forane and weak U.S. demand for anaesthetic machinery, was the only BOC unit to see operating profits fall, dropping 11 percent to 53.1 million pounds.
Rosenkranz said Ohmeda would continue to have a difficult time in the six months to March 1997 but should turn in a flat performance for the year as a whole, and ""...starting next year this thing ought to start climbing.
The market had also been braced for a poor performance at Edwards Vacuum Products, whose machinery creates super-clean environments for industry, because of a downturn in the overcrowded semi-conductor market.
In the event the loose alliance of business known as vacuum and distribution posted a 28 percent gain in full-year operating profit to 90.3 million pounds, although the gain in the fourth-quarter had slowed to just eight percent as the impact of a fall-off in semi-conductor orders started to bite.
Rosenkranz pointed to tentative signs of a pick-up in the computer industry, such as a rise in the October U.S. industry book-to-bill ratio. Nevertheless he said the vacuum business ""will see a decline in profits this year"", but did not predict its extent.
Uncertainty also remains over the impact of sterling, whose newfound strength ate into the gain in fourth-quarter profits, trimming their advance by three percentage points to around nine-percent.",0
"Austin Reed Group Plc supplier of pinstriped suits to generations of British businessmen, said on Wednesday that a return to favour with women executives helped to boost its first-half profits and sales.
The group, which has around 50 stores in the UK and sells its classic-cut styles in Europe, Japan and the U.S., saw first half profits jump 64 percent to 2.3 million pounds ($3.6 million) while sales climbed 7.0 percent to 38.9 million pounds.
New chief executive Chris Thomson said in an interview that a turnaround in womens' clothing, which now accounts for around 20 percent of sales, was a key factor behind the gains.
He said the 1995 spring collection for women had been a ""bit of disaster,"" when Austin Reed's ranges ""didn't sell and we had to substantially discount to get rid of stock, so we are delighted by the way it's come back so successfully.""
Austin Reed, which began life in 1900 as a gentlemen's outfitters in Fenchurch Street in the heart of the City, said there are encouraging signs of a rise in UK consumer activity.
""We are trading in a very competitive market,"" Thomson said, but he added that the group's autumn sales are ahead by around nine percent so far from a year ago.
The company plans to step up sales of its branded clothing through German, French and Italian retailers in particular.
""The Austin Reed brand is well known in Europe, being a quintessentially British brand, and I think there are tremendous opportunities to expand that,"" Thomson said.",0
"Zeneca Group Plc said on Wednesday that it expected ""substantial"" peak sales in excess of $400 million for its new asthma treatment Accolate and schizophrenia drug Seroquel.
In an interview with Reuters, chief executive David Barnes said: ""Our benchmark for a substantial product is one that has sales of $400 million plus, and both of those have that potential.""
Barnes also painted an upbeat picure of prospects for Zomig, the migraine treatment obtained last year by Zeneca from its newly-merged rival Glaxo Wellcome Plc.
Some analysts had questioned whether Seroquel and Accolate -- which represent treatment breakthroughs in their repsective categories but also face potentially stiff competition -- would prove to be major sellers.
Accolate is the first of a new generation of asthma drugs taken in tablet form which will aim to erode the market share of inhaled steroids. The drugs, known as leukotreine antagonists, are designed to prevent or reduce the severity of asthma attacks rather than relieve existing attacks.
""The Holy Grail for the treatment of asthma has been simple tablet formulation,"" said Barnes.
Accolate was launched in the U.S, where steroid-based inhaled asthma drugs have never been as accepted as in Europe, in October. Although he declined to give details of sales, Barnes said ""experience has been encouraging,"" and added ""sales are fully up to our expectations.""
""One of the most gratifying things has been the level of physician interest generated by the launch of Accolate,"" said Barnes, adding that the company had received ""a large number"" of inquiries from U.S. doctors about Accolate.
Earlier today Zeneca announced a 21 percent expansion of its U.S. sales force to help it deal with a rush of product launches, including the possible launch of Seroquel and Zomig later this year.
""The migraine market is growing very fast indeed, it's a substantial market, and so far as one is able to judge from clinical data Zomig has faster onset of action and maybe more consistent results than the leading product , (Glaxo Wellcome's) Imigran. I think it has substantial potential.""
Barnes said Zeneca's new prostate cancer drug Casodex continued ""to make very exciting progress"" in the second half of 1996, taking more than 50 percent of new prescriptions in the U.S. and was ""ahead of our forecasts.""
Some $35 million worth of Casodex was sold in the first six months of 1996. The drug, which is currently approved for combination therapy, is being tested for use as monotherapy and for use at earlier stages of the disease.
""We now know that Casodex will be a bigger product than we thought in 1993 (when Zeneca was demerged from Imperial Chemical Industries Plc ) and it will be a substantially bigger product than most analysts thought in 1993,"" said Barnes.",0
"Supermarket group Budgens Plc said on Monday that it expected to open 10 new wholly-owned stores in 1997, as well as continuing to build up its presence on petrol station forecourts.
In a telephone interview with Reuters after the company announced an 18 percent rise in first-half pretax profit to 5.04 million stg, chief executive John von Spreckelsen said the group continued to be ""well-placed as a small operator in this niche where we are complementary to the superstores and the discounters.""  
""The successful companies will continue to take market share from the less successful ones,"" he said.
Budgens saw sales rise by 8.1 percent to 183.0 million stg in the 28 weeks to November, while on a like-for-like basis they climbed 4.5 percent.
Spreckelsen said that sales growth in the run-up to Christmas slowed down as large stores pulled in trade, but had picked up again in January.
Shares in the group were virtually unchanged after the results, trading just 1/4 pence higher at 46 1/2 in early dealing on Monday.",0
"British Biotech Plc published further evidence on Monday that its cancer drug Marimastat worked, but analysts said there was still a long way to go before its potential as a blockbuster product can be confirmed.
Shares in the company slipped back after its keenly-awaited announcement appeared to provide comfort for both bulls and bears on Marimastat, a new class of cancer drug which some predict could one day have sales of $4 billion a year.
The stock was down 14 1/2 pence at 217 pence in early afternoon trading. But analysts noted that it rose sharply last week ahead of publication, while the decision by Morgan Grenfell to sell a sizeable chunk of its holding on October 29 had mopped up much of the buying interest in advance.
Oxford-based British Biotech used a cancer conference in Vienna to make a number of presentations on trials of the drug in gastric, colo-rectal, ovarian and pancreatic cancer.
It said the studies, based on cancer patients who continued taking the drug after the 28-day period needed for Phase II trials, confirmed Marimastat's ability to reduce the rate of rise of cancer antigens, one measure of how much cancer is present in the body. It also provided evidence of succcess in gastric cancer, where a large scale trial is now underway.
Some analysts said there was little new in the statement, which was largely a confirmation of Phase II, or intermediate stage, data published in May.
""Those who were sceptical in May will remain sceptical and those who were bullish in May will remain bullish,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Finance director James Noble said the company had been deliberately cautious in its comments to avoid raising false hopes among cancer sufferers. Nevertheless he told Reuters that ""In many ways I think this is the most impressive data since the company was floated.
One of the bulls, Greig Middleton analyst John Savin, said the real news was hidden in presentations made by doctors at the Vienna conference. He said that despite the ""mishmash"" of data from the trials, which covered 381 patients, there was ""very compelling"" evidence that Marimastat had improved chances of survival.
""On this information today we can say that...37 percent (of patients) had a real overall response which improved their survival chance significantly,"" Savin said.
However, others expressed disappointment that British Biotech failed to provide more detailed analysis of side effects caused by Marimastat. British Bitoech confirmed that it caused joint pain, mainly in the arm and shoulder, with around 30 percent of patients affected after three to five months.
Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said the side effect profile will be crucial to Marimastat's potential. ""Drugs become top sellers because of their side effect profile rather than because of their efficacy profile,"" he said.
Noble played down concerns about side effects, saying ""they are not a serious problem. They are reversible."" He said patients who suffer badly will be able to interrupt their treatment from time to time without any adverse impact.
Analysts pointed out that no real estimate of just how big Marimastat will be could be made until Phase III trials were completed. This means investors will have to wait until 1998 at the very earliest for hard evidence that their optimism about Marimastat and British Biotech is well founded.",0
"A revolution in the treatment of HIV and AIDS is proving a godsend not just for patients but for drug companies which have poured millions of pounds into fighting the epidemic.
Cocktails of new and old drugs are resulting in dramatic improvements in both quality of life and life expectancy, with some patient groups forecasting that death rates from AIDS in Europe next year could fall by 50 percent.
And as patients live longer and more people seek treatment at earlier stages of illness, drug companies like Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc are looking forward to a quantum leap in sales, with global turnover of AIDS and HIV products forecast to treble by the end of the century.
Analysts at Lehman Brothers expect sales of AIDS drugs at Glaxo Wellcome, which by a mixture of luck and good judgement holds two of the cornerstone drugs for combination therapy, to soar to around $2 billion by the end of the century from just $300 million in 1995.
Keith Alcorn, who writes for the influential British newsletter AIDS Treatment Update, used by both patients and doctors, said: ""This year has been the most exceptional year in AIDS treatment yet, and the effects are very, very tangible. People are going back to work after being very ill and that in itself is quite unexpected.""
ADVANCES REVIVE AZT
Advances have led to an extraordinary revival in the fortunes of Glaxo Wellcome's Retrovir. The drug, also known as AZT, was launched with a great fanfare in 1987, but its erratic performance disappointed patients and shareholders alike.
Doctors have found that using Retrovir, which stops the HIV virus from replicating, in combination with other treatments such as Bristol Myers Squibb Co's Didanosine, Hoffmann-La Roche's Zalcitabine and above all a new Glaxo Wellcome drug called Epivir can radically cut levels of HIV in the blood.
And preliminary evidence suggests the addition of a whole new class of drug, known as protease inhibitors, to the cocktail can produce even more sensational results, with the virus brought below detectable levels.
Lehman Brothers analyst Ian Smith said: ""Use of Retrovir alone had a relatively minimal and transient effect on CD4 cell levels (key cells which HIV destroys, undermining the immune system) and viral load. But in combination the impact on viral load and CD4 was nothing short of stunning compared to what we saw a few years ago.""
The progress has electrified an industry that just two years ago was mired in gloom over prospects for a breakthrough in treating AIDS. Anita Kidgell, Glaxo Wellcome's antivirals product communication manager, said that when scientists, activists and drug companies met at the 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, Canada, in July the atmosphere had been transformed.
""We were seeing that one could reduce the levels of the virus in patients' blood to undetectable levels,"" Kidgell said.
For the moment Glaxo Wellcome seems to have cornered the AIDS drug market, with Lehman predicting sales of Retrovir will double to $600 million by 1998 and that sales of Epivir, which Glaxo shrewdly licensed from Canada's BioChem Pharma Inc in 1990, will hit $750 million by 2000 from just $12 million in 1995.
But other companies are ahead of the British giant in developing protease inhibitors, the third element in the cocktail, which block an enzyme crucial to the spread of the HIV virus within the body.
Some 20 protease inhibitors are being developed, and Merck & Co, Abbott Laboratories Inc and Roche Holdings AG have all rushed versions on to the market this year. The three companies are cautious about giving sales figures, but anecdotal evidence from patient groups together with U.S. sales data suggests that Merck's Crixivan is far outselling its rivals. Sales of this class of drug are likely to reach around $300 million this year.
NOTE OF CAUTION
But while there is understandable euphoria over the progress made to date, Robin Gorna, director of health promotion at Britain's leading AIDS charity the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""We must be very cautious about saying everything is OK, we have got a cure."" She said the mix of drugs taken by AIDS patients carry a raft of side effects and enforce a strict and life-changing dietary regime and timetable.
The explosion in effective treatment also has serious consequences for overstetched health and insurance budgets.
The Terrence Higgins Trust estimates that costs to the British taxpayer in the year to March 1998 of treatment with Retrovir alone would be 10.3 million pounds ($17.29 million). Treatment with a combination of three drugs would bump this up to around 50 million. And if, as expected, more people are encouraged to come forward and seek treatment before they develop AIDS, this could rise to around 74 million pounds.
Gorna said stories already abounded of patients being unable to get the drugs they need, either though lack of funds or ignorance on the part of doctors. AIDS support groups and companies, who cooperate increasingly, say they have to persuade governments that extended treatment with drugs is much cheaper than costly hospital care and dealing with the multiple complications of AIDS.
""We are all very hopeful,"" said Gorna. ""It is looking good, but it really isn't over yet and we need drugs that are effective in the long term.""",0
"British Petroleum Co Plc (BP) extolled the virtues of ""self help"" on Tuesday as it reported its best-ever third quarter earnings despite pressure on profit margins in some key businesses.
Third-quarter net earnings jumped by 22 percent to 650 million pounds ($1.07 billion), towards the top end of forecasts, while in the first nine months of the year they were up 28 percent to a record 1.93 billion pounds.
BP said strong oil prices, which have recently been at their highest levels since the 1991 Gulf War at around $22 a barrell, boosted earnings by between $400 million-$500 million in the third quarter.
But it added that the gains were more than offset by weaker profit margins in refining, marketing and chemicals, which accounted for about 27 percent of group net earnings.
Group chief executive John Browne said BP was enjoying the benefits of a raft of cost-cutting and efficiency drives, which were adding $150 million to profit every quarter.
""What we see here has not come about as a result of high oil prices, it has come about as a result of self help,"" he said.
The market took the results calmly, with BP shares adding two pence to close at 640.5 pence after touching a high of 647p. However, trading in BP shares on the options market was active.
""People are still speculating on a fairly sharp rise in BP shares,"" one options specialist said.
""In a sense BP have spoilt us,"" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst Irene Himona.
""We've got used to them coming out with a good set of numbers at the top of the range, and unfortunately with (rival) Shell it is the other way around.""
BP's results contrasted with disappointment last week at third-quarter figures from rival Royal Dutch/Shell Group, where profits fell on the back of low refining margins and a weak chemicals market.
BP also emphasised the relative stability in its earnings, partly as a result of the vigorous cost-cutting at its exploration and production activities.
""They are very much on the ball and very focused. They have achieved a lot of efficiency improvements and delivered a lot of savings,"" said Himona.
BP was upbeat about near term propsects, with oil demand expected to remain strong into 1997. But it said its long-term view that the oil price would settle back into arange of $16 to $18 a barrell had not changed. ""The question is how we get from here to there,"" said Browne.
Morgan Stanley analyst Chris Buckley said the oil price was always the greatest uncertainty, but added that lower prices tended to mean margins could improve in downstream activities like chemicals and refining.",0
"U.S. power utility Dominion Resources Inc will have to reconsider the price it is prepared to pay for East Midlands Electricity Plc if it is realistic about acquiring it, analysts said on Thursday.
On Wednesday Dominion's interest in East Midlands was flushed out by U.K. stock exchange regulators after East Midland's share price jumped by 13 percent.
But Dominion said it would not go much above Wednesday's closing price of 608 pence, valuing East Midlands at just over 1.2 billion stg ($1.97 billion), and industry sources said it would ""run away"" if the market drove the price up further.
Investors seemed to take Dominion at its word on Thursday, and with no bid on the table East Midlands' share price slipped back 21 pence to 587 in midafternoon trading.
But analysts said an offer would be most unlikely to succeed at 610 pence, valuing East Midlands less highly than Northern Electric Plc, which is subject of a 659 million stg bid from U.S. energy group CE Electric.
SG Strauss Turnbull analyst Marshall Whiting said Dominion was being ""very cheeky.""
Dominion's declaration of interest follows hard on the heels of CalEnergy Co Inc unit CE Electric's 630 pence offer for Northern last week.
Using median forecast figures gathered by Edinburgh Financial Publishing, CE Electric's offer represents a P/E ratio of 9.3 against Northern's prospective year through March 1997 earnings and 8.6 times year through March 1998 earnings.",0
"Investors in the fast-growing British biotechnology sector can look forward to another roller-coaster ride in 1997, with serious profits still there to be made by investors who pick their stocks carefully.
Although sharp falls in the value of the sector since its peak last May have underlined the riskiness of biotechs as an investment, analysts said 1997 should be the year when a host of companies publish data which will start to prove that the underlying technology can produce drugs that really work.
It should also see a number of businesses step out of the long shadow cast by British Biotech Plc, which continues to ride high on hopes that its cancer treatment Marimastat will be the sector's first wonderdrug.
Among those most keenly tipped for success next year are Biocompatibles International Plc, Celltech Group Plc, Chiroscience Group Plc, Cortecs International Ltd and Scotia Holdings Plc.
And there are growing signs that other countries, notably France and Germany, will start to challenge Britain's domination of the European biotech industry. Britain currently has more biotech companies than the rest of Europe combined.
STOCKS STILL AHEAD DESPITE 1996 SETBACK
Analysts at Lehman Brothers said the end of a 14-month long run of gains by Britain's biotech stocks in May, since when prices have dropped by around 40 percent, jolted investors, leading many to question the real value of biotechs.
But the Lehman Brothers UK/Europe Biotechnology Index also shows that even after this setback, biotech stocks are still showing an overall gain of around 150 percent compared with the start of their bull run in February 1995.
And in a note on the sector, Lehman said investors could buy into drug discovery and development in biotechs at a fraction of the cost of buying into the pipelines of mature companies like Glaxo Wellcome Plc and Zeneca Group Plc.
Nomura Equity Research analyst Nick Woolf also disputed another claim of recent months, that UK biotech stocks are vastly overvalued compared with the much larger U.S. sector.
Woolf said a ratio of market capitalisation to five years of spending on research and development showed U.S. biotechs are valued at four to five times accumulated spending and British companies at between four and six times.
""We are not overvalued compared to the U.S,"" he said. ""When people say the U.K. is overvalued they are looking at British Biotech, but second place companies like Chiroscience, Celltech and Cortecs are all looking very good value.""
Woolf and Yamaichi International analyst Erling Refsum said investors had become much more choosy about which stocks to buy, but there was now a danger that people were being too cautious. Where a year ago people would put money into almost any biotech that could type out a prospectus, in recent months a number of small flotations and fundings have been scaled down or dropped.
Even British Biotech was forced to turn to underwriters to rescue its 143 million pounds ($236.5 million) cash call in July.
Refsum said the market was focusing too much on the 50 percent chance that a drug in Phase II trials would fail to get to market rather than the equal chance it would succeed. Woolf added ""I think it is the wrong way of looking at it. You should evaluate risk, but across a portfolio of companies where you are spreading the risk.""
ISSUES TO WATCH IN 1997
Among key stocks to watch in 1997 will again be British Biotech, where clinical trials of Marimastat are entering the final phase. Although trials will not be completed until 1998 at the earliest, the company plans detailed updates on the drug, probably in May and November. Bad news is still expected to have a disproportionate effect on the whole of the sector.
Celltech is singled out by Nomura, Yamaichi and Lehman. Nomura said Celltech is ""very good value,"" and Lehman have a target valuation of 10 pounds per share for the company by the end of this year compared with a price of 485 pence on Friday afternoon. Optimism about a septic shock drug, being developed with Germany's Bayer AG, and progress on a therapy for Acute Myeloid Leukaemia are seen as key drivers.
Cambridge-based Chiroscience, which Lehman values at 600 pence per share compared with last Friday afternoon's price of 312, is also favoured, amid hopes that a new local anesthetic will provide a flow of cash for an ambitious pipeline of novel drugs including cancer and arthritis treatments.
UK-Australian group Cortecs is strongly tipped by Yamaichi's Refsum, who believes oral osteoporosis and insulin drugs could turn out to be $1 billion-sellers, while he also favours Scotia, which is in the unusual position of having three drugs nearing the market. Tiny Scottish group Shield Diagnostics Plc could be sitting on a product worth around $200 million a year if data due to be published in the first half of 1997 prove its diagnostic kit is an accurate forecaster of heart attacks.
And Lehmans said contact lens and medical devices company Biocampatibles had ""enormous upside potential"". It said the stock could be worth 16 pounds by the end of 1997 compared with 693 pence on Friday.",0
"British chemicals group Albright & Wilson Plc said on Monday that a keenly-awaited drop in raw materials prices had failed to emerge.
In an interview with Reuters, Albright & Wilson chief executive Robin Paul said although costs had stabilised after sharp gains last year ""there has still been a small net increase, which has meant that any improvement in our performance has had to come from our own efforts, whereas we had been hoping for some reduction.""  
Cost increases have affected the performance of the whole industry, and added an extra 40 million stg to Albright & Wilson's bills in 1995. The Birmingham-based group is the world's biggest and lowest-cost producer of wet phosphoric acid, used in a wide range of processes from putting the tang into fizzy drinks to making soap powders. Rises in phosphorous prices, especially in China and the rest of Asia, partly eroded gains from strong demand for phosphates in the first half.  
Paul, who steered Albright & Wilson back onto the stock market last year after 17 years as a subsidiary of U.S. giant Tenneco Inc, said another threat on the horizon was the continued strength of sterling, which could raise the cost of exports from the UK and reduce foreign earnings.
""Where this isn't expected to have a substantial effect on 1996 results, because most of the contracts are in place, it is causing us to look very hard at the 1997 budget because of inevitable pressures on translation and transaction,"" Paul said.  
He added it was difficult to quantify the impact of the pound continuing at current high levels, although he said strength against the dollar would act as a ""net hedge"" by lowering raw material costs.
Although phosphorous-derived products have driven profits since its foundation in 1851, Albright & Wilson also produces specialty chemicals, including flame-retardants for protective clothing and furniture, and surfactants, foaming and wetting agents used in detergents and soaps.  
Paul said in some ways the company's relaunch had come at a difficult time, with its first set of interim results as a newly independent company in 1995 heralding a worldwide downturn in the chemical industry as higher costs ate into profits.
The group's share price has clawed its way back from a low of 152 pence last November to stand at 177 pence early Tuesday afternoon after touching a peak of 207 1/2 pence in September. But Paul warned that shareholders and analysts should not expect ""one-year spectaculars,"" especially in terms of a share buyback.  
News at the start of the year that the group had sought authority for a share buyback caused some excitement, particularly given its low gearing, which stood at just 14 percent at the end of June. ""The directors got permission to buy back shares, but without plans to do so,"" Paul said. ""People read rather more into it than was justified.""
Nor will cash be used for acquisitions, unless they ""tidy up"" shareholdings in associates or offer technological benefits. Paul said growth would be organic, with a reinvigorated research and development program producing a range of new products, including improved water treatment and flame-retardant chemicals and a breakthrough to stop paints from flaking.
""We are not looking for one-year spectaculars at Albright & Wilson. We have been around for 145 years and and even Tenneco's ownership (from 1978) could be seen in retrospect as a phase in the history of the company,""said Paul. ""Our aim is to build up a solid performance year-on-year-on-year.""",0
"Shares in British-based drugs group Medeva Plc raced ahead on Thursday following encouraging results from tests of a potential new vaccine and treatment for hepatitis B.
Shares in Medeva, which have climbed steadily this week on the expectation of good news, jumped almost six percent to 296 pence before easing to 289-1/2 pence in early afternoon trading, up 10 pence on the day. The stock has risen more than 13 percent since the start of the year.
In an update of its product portfolio, Medeva also announced a tie-up with small drug discovery group Peptide Therapeutics Plc which could see painful injections against illnesses such as influenza, typhoid and tetanus replaced by nasal sprays or capsules.
The two are also investigating a vaccine against the E-coli bacteria, which has killed 17 people in a recent outbreak in Scotland. Medeva said it spent three million pounds ($4.90 million) taking a 2.5 percent stake in Peptide, whose shares soared nearly 20 percent to 289 pence.
But the market's main focus was on prospects for the hepatitis B vaccine, Hepagene, which many analysts see as a huge potential money-spinner. In an interview with Reuters, Medeva chief executive Bill Bogie said Hepagene could eventually sell ""millions of doses"" a year, and carry a three-figure price tag.
The vaccine is targeted at a significant group of people who do not respond to existing Hepatitis B vaccines, such as SmithKline Beecham Plc's Engerix-B.
Medeva sees a large market for it, especially among health workers and police who are routinely protected against the infection.
Still more exciting is the drug's potential to treat people who are already infected with Hepatitis B, which is 100 times more infectious than HIV and kills two million people a year around the world. Bogie said tests on people who do not respond to the current treatment, Interferon, showed a 38 percent response rate.
Medeva will decide later this year whether to expand production capacity for Hepagene at its plant in Speke in northwest England or to look elsewhere for extra output.
A major surprise was Medeva's declaration that it would seek regulatory approval for Hepagene in Europe and the United States in 1998, opening up the prospect of first sales in 1999. Bogie said this was a sign of confidence that Medeva would win outstanding battles over patents on both sides of the Atlantic.
It won a key judgement in Britain's House of Lords against U.S. rival Biogen Inc last year. Bogie said Medeva would not be seeking marketing partners for Hepagene beyond its existing agreement with Johnson & Johnson to sell Hepagene in southeast Asia.
""We are not looking for a partner. That does not mean they won't happen but we are fairly confident we can do it ourselves,"" he said.
Medeva, whose executives spent Thursday morning with analysts, also announced plans to go ahead with development of a purified form of its most profitable product, the behaviour-controlling drug Methylphenidate.
Bogie said the new version of the drug being developed by Chiroscience Group Plc would give Medeva important patent advantages over rivals and cut down the number of times a day Methylphenidate is taken.",0
"British building materials group Blue Circle Industries Plc produced tentative signs of a turnaround at its troubled European heating operations on Tuesday, and promised a ten-fold increase in heating profits over the next three years.
The company also launched a blistering attack on the government, blaming ""disgracefully low"" infrastructure spending for a slide in its British cement sales.
The recovery in heating, together with continued strong performances in the highly profitable Chile and Malaysia markets and the USA, helped lift Blue Circle's interim pretax profit by 11.7 percent to 116.3 million pounds ($181.5 million), at the top end of analysts' forecasts, with the interim dividend rising by 6 percent to 4.25 pence.
Against a background of a weak stock market Blue Circle shares closed down 5 pence at 372 pence.
The heating operations, which are undergoing a major restructuring focused on France, Germany and Britain, posted operating profits of nine million pounds in the six months to June, up from just 100,000 pounds a year before.
But Britain's biggest cement producer also warned that it saw ""no significant signs of recovery"" in the key British cement market, and said it expected 1996 sales to be down four percent from 1995's depressed performance.
Ian McKenzie, chief executive of the group's British cement business Blue Circle Cement, blamed poor housing starts and low government infrastructure spending, warning that if the underspend continued ""the damage done to the competitiveness of British industry would be very great indeed.""
Worries about cement were offset by strength overseas and signs of early progress in turning around heating, which encouraged analysts to maintain full-year profit forecasts.
Chief executive Keith Orrell-Jones told Reuters the group's aim of achieving annual cost savings of 25 million pounds at the division is ""well up to programme,"" with nine million pounds coming through this year and the full benefit seen in 1997.
Orrell-Jones said he was confident Blue Circle could achieve a 15 percent return on its 600 million pound investment in the struggling division, or some 90 million pounds, within three years, despite sluggishness in Germany and France.
""We are disappointed with the performance of the economies of both those countries, and we think it is not likely to ease very rapidly,"" said Orrell-Jones, adding ""that is why we set a three-year time horizon"" for recovery.
With gearing a miniscule 1.5 percent at the end of June, Orrell-Jones said Blue Circle was actively looking for opportunities to expand.
""We'd like to grow our cement business: it depends on where the opportunities crop up. In the U.S. it's a question of waiting for the right opportunity and the right time in the cycle,"" he said.
Blue Circle is ""actively looking in South-East Asia, and we are taking a very careful look at India,"" he said, adding that it was also interested in expanding its south American operations beyond Chile and into Argentina.",0
"Shareholders in tiny British healthcare group Enviromed Plc staged a bloodless coup on Friday, toppling the embattled company's board.
The gentlemanly storming of the barricades around Enviromed's Knightsbridge headquarters was led by Ron Zwanziger, chief executive officer of Enviromed's biggest shareholder, U.S. company Selfcare Inc.
Zwanziger has watched the value of Selfcare's 29 percent stake in Enviromed dwindle as the share price plummeted from around 112 pence per share in December 1994 to around 25 pence, in line with a collapse in the group's profitability.
Selfcare, which produces tests for pregnancy and infectious diseases, asked shareholders to back its plans to remove four members of the board, led by managing director Thomas Murphy, at an extraordinary meeting on Friday.
But after weeks of charge and counter-charge by both sides, the expected showdown in the unlikely setting of Dean's Yard, next to Westminster Abbey, turned out to be a sedate rubber-stamping exercise.
The board of Enviromed, which produces specialist enzymes and diagnostic equipment, spiked the guns of its opponents by conceding defeat after proxy votes showed 49 percent backing for Selfcare and just under 39 percent supporting the status quo.
A brief show of hands was sufficent to confirm the handover of power and the new board, with Selfcare's Zwanziger as non-executive chairman, was already holding its first meeting as individual shareholders continued to drift in.
This was Zwanziger's second attempt to get rid of the board, which he quit in April 1995 over differences involving a joint venture between Selfcare and Enviromed. Resolutions demanding the board step down were withdrawn just before the start of another extraordinary general meeting in February 1996.
Zwanziger accused Enviromed of eroding shareholder value through poor management and of holding firesales of assets, including the disposal of a dental distribution business and veterinary diagnostic operation, as it sought to cut debts.
In turn Enviromed accused Zwanziger of trying to gain control of the company ""via the back door"", and challenged him to launch a full takeover bid.
Enviromed's value began to plunge in December 1994, the month that Murphy was appointed, as a pretax profit of 2.2 million stg in the year to September 1994 turned into a loss of 8.2 million stg a year later. The company's market capitalization fell from around 28 million stg to just over 6.0 million.
Murphy vehemently rejected blame for the collapse, saying he had inherited a pile of problems he and other board members had worked hard to resolve.
One of the new board's first goals will be to appoint a finance director. In a letter to shareholders ahead of the extraordinary meeting Zwanziger said the new board would focus on the development of the enzyme buisness Biozyme which it said was already profitable.",0
"General Motors Corp's decision to invest 300 million stg in its U.K. operations reflected confidence in its Vauxhall Motors unit and international prospects for the Astra model, Vauxhall said on Tuesday.
Vauxhall said the three-year investment will be used to modernise its Ellesmere Port plant in north-west England, which makes Astra cars and vans.
The announcement, made at the British International Motor Show, guarantees the livelihoods of the 4,200 people employed at the plant and will create at least 200 new jobs.
Vauxhall Motors chairman and managing director Nick Reilly told Reuters in an interview that a decision on increasing the number of shifts worked at the plant to three from two to be taken over the next two years could create hundreds more jobs.
Any decision would depend on ""what the market is then and the demand for the model is at the time.""
The Astra model has been consistently one of Britain and Europe's top five sellers since its launch five years ago, with the development of an estate model boosting its position.
Reilly said the 300 million stg investment was won against intense competition within GM and reflected the transformation of Ellesmere Port from a domestically-oriented plant to ""a very important source of manufacturing within General Motors.""
He forecast strong growth for the Astra in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Reilly said the British car market is currently ""the most competitive in Europe"", with a number of importers using huge U.K. fleet sales as a way of offloading cars that remain unsold in sluggish domestic markets. Europe remained ""flat,"" he added.
Vauxhall hoped to keep its market share at around 14.5 percent in 1996, and Reilly said its profitablity is ""going in the right direction"" after a tough 1995.",0

"A Tibetan nun has had her jail term doubled to 18 years for refusing to recognise Beijing's choice as the reincarnation of the region's second holiest monk, the Tibet Information Network (TIN) said on Monday.
The sentence of 19-year-old Ngawang Sangdrol, jailed since she was 15, was doubled in July, partly because she refused to accept Beijing's choice as the Panchen Lama, according to the London-based TIN, which monitors human rights in the Himalayan region.
""Ngawang...is now facing (more time) in jail than any other female political prisoner in Tibet,"" TIN said. She is due for release in the year 2010.
Officials reached by telephone in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa denied knowledge of the report.
The 10th Panchen Lama died in 1989, and Beijing has anointed a six-year-old boy as his reincarnation.
The Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, has named another six-year-old boy as the 11th Panchen Lama, and many Tibetans see the Beijing-backed child as a pretender.
Beijing's choice is in the Chinese capital under state protection against any possible assassination attempts by radical Tibetans, Chinese sources have said.
China denies there are political prisoners in Tibet and says foreign critics of its human rights record are interfering in its internal affairs.
Ngawang is already serving nine years -- three years for taking part in a pro-independence demonstration in 1992 and six years for singing nationalist songs in prison in 1993, according to TIN.
Her sentence was doubled in part because she refused to tidy her cell in Lhasa's Drapchi prison in March in apparent protest against a political re-education campaign, TIN said.
The campaign is designed to force prisoners to accept Beijing's choice as the reincarnated Panchen Lama.
Ngawang also refused to stand up in the presence of a Tibetan official, Brigade Commander Khandrol Jangpe, TIN said.
The human rights group, which had reported in August that Ngawang was on a restricted diet and confined in a cell with no windows, said it had only recently received confirmation of the longer jail term through a former prisoner who fled Tibet.
China has vowed to curb the influence of Buddhism and the Dalai Lama in Tibet, saying socialism must take precedence over religion.
The Dalai Lama, the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against communist rule. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.
State media have complained that monks and nuns outnumber high school students and that too much money was spent on the region's monasteries.",0
"A Chinese court has jailed a 56-year-old dissident for five years for subversion, dealing another blow to the country's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
The Intermediate People's Court in Xi'an city, in the northern province of Shaanxi, convicted Zhang Zong'ai this week of spreading ""counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement"", his lawyer, Zhang Jiankang, said on Saturday.
The dissident, detained since June, has appealed to the Shaanxi provincial Higher People's Court, the Hong Kong-based Human Rights and Democracy in China Information Centre said.
""Their (Chinese authorities) intention is to kill the chicken for the monkey to see... to frighten other dissidents,"" a spokesman for the centre, which monitors human rights abuses in China, said in a telephone interview.
Zhang was previously jailed for five years for demanding Premier Li Peng be impeached for ordering the military to crush student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989, the human rights watchdog said.
He lost his seat in the local lawmaking body along with his teaching job at the Xi'an Institute of Statistics and his wife divorced him after his incarceration in 1989, his family said.
Asked to comment on Zhang's latest conviction, his sister, Zhang Xin, said he was innocent.
""He was wrongly accused,"" the sister said by telephone. ""He didn't commit any crime... He didn't do anything.""
His lawyer told Reuters the court had found Zhang guilty of attacking China's judiciary in an interview with former student leader Wang Dan that was later published in a Hong Kong newspaper.
Wang, a former student leader of the 1989 democracy demonstrations, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government.
The court also found Zhang guilty of signing a petition last year urging authorities to show political tolerance, the lawyer said.
The court cleared Zhang of any wrongdoing in accepting money from an overseas group, the lawyer said. The court ruled Zhang did accept money but that he did not use the funds for counter-revolutionary activities.
The lawyer said the verdict also did not mention a charge in the bill of indictment that accused Zhang of ""pledging loyalty"" to the Taiwan authorities by writing to General Wego Chiang.
Chiang is the sole surviving son of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, who fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province.
The dissident had not mailed a letter to Chiang that was found in his home in Xi'an.
Beijing's Communists and Taipei's Nationalists have been political rivals for almost five decades.
In recent months, the Chinese authorities have dealt crushing blows to the struggling democracy movement.
Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.

"Chinese activists, in a statement on Tuesday hours ahead of a visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, protested against American backing for Japan's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
""We hold that Japan is not qualified to become a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations,"" the activists said in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is due to arrive in Beijing later on Tuesday for a three-day visit.
The letter, signed by 15 activists, said they opposed Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security Council because many Japanese politicians had been reluctant to apologise for its war atrocities and had tried to whitewash history.
China says more than 35 million people were killed or wounded during Japan's invasion and occupation of most of China from the early 1930s to 1945.
""(We) strongly protest the U.S. government supporting Japan's (bid) to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council to draw Japan over to its side,"" said the letter, a copy of which was made available to Reuters.
Tong Zeng, a leader of the group, said he would forward the letter to Christopher through the U.S. embassy in Beijing.
The Chinese government, eager for more low-interest loans from Japan, has been reluctant to antagonise Tokyo and has not taken a public stance on the issue.
The United States has long supported giving Japan and Germany permanent seats on the Security Council.
The council currently consists of five permanent members that were the main victors in World War Two -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- and 10 non-permanent members who serve two-year terms.
Most Chinese have been slow to forgive Japan's war past.
""U.S. backing for Japan's (bid)...will undoubtedly encourage the resurrection of Japanese militarism and bring a new threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the letter said.
The anti-Japanese activists recounted what they said were U.S. mistakes, including not putting Emperor Hirohito on trial after the end of World War Two in 1945.
""After the end of the war, the United States harmed the feelings of the Chinese people several times...sheltering Japan's top war criminal Emperor Hirohito,"" the letter said. Hirohito died in 1989.
The activists also faulted the United States for ""ignoring historical facts"" and handing disputed islands in the East China Sea to Japan in 1971.
Sino-Japanese ties were strained this year over the islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyus and Tokyo the Senkakus.
A Japanese right-wing group built a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July, triggering anti-Japanese demonstrations in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Taiwan's Nationalist rulers, who lost the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, also claim the islands. Activists in the British colony of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997, have opposed Japan's territorial claims.
Emotions were fanned in September when a Hong Kong activist drowned after he jumped into stormy waters around the islands to demonstrate support for Chinese claims.",0
"Two Chinese magazines are struggling for survival after being targeted in a crusade by China's propaganda tsars to cleanse the media of liberal influences, Chinese sources said.
""Focus"" magazine in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen has suspended publication for two issues after a Hong Kong newspaper reported the magazine defied propaganda tsars and ran a cover story on the anniversary of the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, the sources said.
The Propaganda Department of the Communist Party had frowned on any commemoration of the decade of turmoil unleashed by revolutionary leader Mao Zedong to purge political rivals and infuse the nation with renewed ideological vigour.
A writer for the magazine said the suspension was due to a Hong Kong newspaper report of the article's publication.
""Had it not been for the foreign report, the magazine would not have suffered this kind of setback,"" said the writers, peaking anonymously ""This was a kind of punishment...by the party.""
In a telephone interview, Li Mei, publisher of Focus, disputed this assessment, saying the suspension was linked to unrelated financial trouble.
Other Chinese sources said the problems at ""Focus"" stemmed from the Communist Party's clampdown on publications and authors who dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.
""If a publication takes a detour (from the party line), it will be suspended for restructuring. There will be no exceptions,"" one source quoted propaganda tsars as saying.
Propaganda tsars are also debating the fate of the Beijing-based magazine ""Orient"" for publishing a series of book reviews on the ""Collected Works of Gu Zhun"", sources said.
The Propaganda Department of the ruling Communist Party had ordered a gag on all debate on the thoughts of Gu, an independent thinker who angered Beijing before his death during the Cultural Revolution.
Gu openly opposed totalitarianism and supported the rule of law and civil rights.
The fifth edition of the magazine was published in September under the watchful eyes of censors, the sources said.
""We will still be able to publish the sixth edition. After that we don't know,"" a magazine editor, who asked not to be named, said in an interview.
""They did not say what exactly the problem was with the magazine,"" said the editor who suggested that politics could be the cause.
The axe has fallen on other publications, authors and filmmakers.
In August, the Press and Publications Administration suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in the southwestern province of Guizhou.
The suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of a privately circulated tract known as the ""10,000-word essay"" that urges a return to class struggle and warns of the erosion of the state sector by private enterprise.
In September, Cui Enqing was sacked as president of the Beijing Youth Daily after the Chinese capital's most outspoken newspaper reported a poisoning case that caused a plunge in sales of a state-owned beverage manufacturer.
Propaganda tsars also have banned all of the novels and two films of controversial writer Wang Shuo.
The campaign to enforce ideological orthodoxy has left Chinese filmmakers at a loss as to what kind of movies would receive the blessings of propaganda tsars. The number of movies made this year has fallen sharply compared with previous years.",0
"China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, reported to be in fragile health, was absent from a rally on Tuesday to pay tribute to him and other survivors of the 1934-36 Long March.
Deng, 92, one of about 700 surviving veterans of the Red Army who trekked 9,650 km (6,000 miles) across China on foot to flee Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, did not appear on state television which showed the 45-minute rally live.
Deng, who no longer holds any office but is believed to remain highly influential, has not been seen in public since early 1994.
His health is a matter of intense speculation in China, Hong Kong and the Asian region because his death is expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.
The official line is that Deng is in good health for a man of his age.
Extensive preparations were made last year for Deng to grace official celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the World War Two victory against Japan, but his scheduled appearance was cancelled at the last minute, Chinese sources said.
The Long March rally was seen by some analysts as a show of support for Deng's successor, Communist Party boss and state president Jiang Zemin, who has been eager to shrug off the patriarch's shadow.
""It was staged to show Jiang has the support of military from the old to the present and future generations,"" one Chinese analyst said.
Long March survivors, including former state president and Jiang's bitter rival Yang Shangkun, were at the rally. A representative of the three million-strong People's Liberation Army pledged to follow Jiang's leadership.
Eight Young Pioneers -- China's version of boy and girl scouts -- recited poems at the rally at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing adjacent to Tiananmen Square.
Wearing his trademark army uniform with no stars or stripes, Jiang urged the ruling Communist Party to inherit the spirit of the Long March.
""The spirit of the Long March...is a strong spiritual force that guarantees our walking from victory to victory,"" Jiang said, reading from a prepared statement.
The gruelling Long March slashed the Red Army's numbers to about 7,000 from 100,000, but survivors were hardened and went on to defeat and drive Chiang and his troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
""The road after the revolution is even longer and the work greater and tougher,"" Jiang said.
Jiang has declared war on crime, corruption and poverty -- problems plaguing China today -- and embarked on a crusade to resurrect socialist ethics, which have been eroded by almost two decades of economic reforms.
He paid little tribute to his mentor, mentioning Deng only twice in his lengthy speech.
The People's Daily, mouthpiece of the Communist Party, splashed on its front page a photograph showing portraits of Jiang, Deng and chairman Mao Zedong hanging over a cultural performance on Monday evening to mark the anniversary.",0
"China's Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin appears to be making all the right moves to shore up his position to retain power after the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, diplomats and analysts said on Friday.
Jiang has declared war on corruption, crime and poverty -- scourges that have plagued China for centuries and led to the downfall of many a dynasty.
In his latest move, he used the party's four-day, annual closed-door plenum that ended in Beijing on Thursday to resurrect ideological puritanism -- spiritual civilisation -- which has been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.
Whether Jiang would be able to stave off challenges from rivals in the party and cling to power in the post-Deng era hinged in part on the crucial 15th party congress to be held in late 1997, diplomats and analysts said.
The party's political heavyweights will be jockeying for position in the run-up to next year's congress, a five-yearly opportunity for reshuffles in the party's powerful Politburo and its yet more influential standing committee.
Chinese sources say the Communist Party is debating a plan to revive the post of chairman and to create one or two vice chairman positions -- one of which could be given to Premier Li Peng, a loose ally of Jiang whose term ends in 1998.
Li is required by the constitution to step down as premier in 1998 after serving two six-year terms and is keen to find another job to remain in the top echelons of power.
Armed with the weapon of spiritual civilisation -- communist jargon for toeing the party line -- Jiang is battling to avoid the fate of his two predecessors, analysts said.
Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang were sacked from the party's general secretary post in 1987 and 1989 respectively because their ""grip on material civilisation was tight but their grip on spiritual civilisation was loose"", one Chinese analyst said.
""They did not pay enough attention to ensuring that the party's position could not be challenged...that was what brought them down,"" an Asian diplomat said of Hu and Zhao.
A plenum communique attested to Jiang's worries. ""From the start to the end, we should be resolute on tightening the grip on both,"" the plenum communique said.
""At no time can we sacrifice spiritual values in the name of momentary economic development,"" the communique said.
The spiritual civilisation campaign aims to create a communist utopia -- stamp out superstition, tighten the party's grip on media, instil politically correct values and create heroes and model workers whose orthodox Marxist behaviour the populace at large should strive to emulate.
It is hardly rousing stuff. But Jiang may be desperate.
Analysts said Jiang remained overshadowed by Deng, architect of the market-oriented economic reforms and still influential even without an official post and despite increasingly fragile health.
""In the midst of his great triumph, Jiang Zemin if he is all that powerful...there is no need for him to go out of his way to mention Deng Xiaoping,"" a Western diplomat said referring to the communique that tips its hat to Deng.
""Jiang Zemin...is still in consolidation mode...in the process of selling himself,"" he said. ""The jury is still out.""
Jiang is eager to consolidate his power base even after amassing the three most important positions in China -- general secretary of the Communist Party, state president and chairman of party's powerful Central Military Commission.
Many diplomats see Jiang as a transitional figure after the death of Deng, which is widely expected to trigger a scramble for power among those eager to succeed him as the de facto emperor of the world's most populous nation.",0
"China sent a senior official to attend a reception at the Ukraine embassy on Friday despite a diplomatic rift over a visit to Kiev by Taiwan's vice president Lien Chan.
But an apparent guest list mix-up left both sides unsure over who would represent Beijing at the reception, held to mark Ukraine's independence day.
Ukraine's ambassador thought Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei would attend, but the Chinese thought it was Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Deguang.
Zhang, however, fell ill and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan showed up instead.
The confusion followed Taiwan Vice President Lien Chan's three-day trip this week to Ukraine which infuriated Beijing.
""It was a misunderstanding...a mix-up,"" Ukrainian Minister-Counsellor Leonid Leshchenko told Reuters, referring to the guest list.
Asked if he saw it as an intentional slap on the wrist, Leshchenko shook his head and said: ""No, no no.""
A Chinese Foreign Ministry protocol officer said Tian, the vice-minister that the Ukrainians were expecting, was abroad.
Ukrainian diplomats noted that Tang, the vice-minister who attended, was filling in for Tian as the acting first vice-minister and was actually higher in rank than the person who fell ill.
Ukraine's Ambassador Anatoly Plyushko emerged from a half-hour chat with Vice-Minister Tang, and said the vice-minister told him that China attached ""great attention to bilateral relations"" and ""hoped to continue to develop"" ties.
Plyushko said the vice-minister did not raise the issue of Lien's three-day Kiev visit.
""All Chinese guests...invited came,"" Plyushko said. ""This is evidence...(of) their attitude towards our relations. I'm optimistic.""
The atmosphere was less pleasant on Wednesday when the Chinese Foreign Ministry summoned Plyushko to protest against Lien's trip.
China regards Taiwan as a rebel province with no right to conduct foreign relations on its own, and has sought to push it into diplomatic isolation since a civil war separated them in 1949.
The former Soviet republic of Ukraine recognises China but not Taiwan.
In apparent retaliation against Lien's visit, Chinese State Councillor Li Tieying, a member of the powerful Politburo of the ruling Communist Party, has postponed a visit to Ukraine.
In Kiev, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko took a shot at Beijing on Thursday, saying China had over-reacted to Lien's visit and calling Beijing's protest ""out of proportion"".",0
"A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of veteran dissident Liu Nianchun against a labour camp term for writing petitions, saying freedom of speech must not endanger the security of the state.
Beijing's Chaoyang District Court rejected Liu's lawsuit on Monday on the grounds that a petition he initiated in 1995 ""contained attacks against the people's government"", said a copy of the verdict seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
The petition ""exceeded the limits of the constitution and the law"", the verdict said.
Liu had argued in his appeal that the constitution guaranteed his right to freedom of speech.
The court rejected Liu's argument, saying freedom of speech ""must not endanger the security, honour and interests of the state"", the verdict said.
Liu's wife, Chu Hailan, said she would appeal even though chances of victory were slim. She has 15 days in which to file an appeal.
""I will definitely appeal. This is our right,"" Chu said by telephone on Tuesday. She attacked the court ruling as ""unfair... not objective and unjust"".
Chu said that during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to China last month police had shunted her to a labour camp in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang where her husband is held to prevent her meeting U.S. officials.
""It's a very desolate place. Life's awfully hard there,"" she said. ""Liu Nianchun... eats only two meals a day.""
She said her husband was sharing a 14-square-metre (150 square-ft) cell with 15 other people.
Last July, police ordered Liu, 48, to serve three years of re-education through labour on top of nearly one year in detention for drafting the petition, which urged the government to re-evaluate its crackown on student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, and to free all political prisoners.
He was also accused of accepting illegal aid from human rights organisations abroad and of trying to form a group to promote protection of workers' rights.
Re-education through labour is a form of administrative punishment that can be imposed by the authorities without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.
Western human rights activists say it is increasingly favoured by the authorities as a way of removing dissidents from circulation without the complications and publicity of a trial.
Liu took part in the Democracy Wall movement of the early 1980s and was sentenced in 1981 to a three-year jail term for ""counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement"", or subversion.
Prominent dissident and former student leader Wang Dan, who drafted the petition together with Liu, was sentenced to 11 years in prison last month for conspiring to subvert the government -- a sentence that triggered international condemnation.

"China's former first lady Wang Guangmei auctioned her private antique collection on Tuesday and said she would use proceeds to help impoverished mothers.
Wang's collection, consisting of porcelain bowls and plates and a brush holder made of ivory dating back to the Qing (1644-1911) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, fetched 566,000 yuan ($68,000) at an auction at a Beijing hotel.
""My mother gave them to me ... They are priceless to me,"" Wang told Reuters.
She is the widow of former president Liu Shaoqi who died in prison during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
The Sungari auction house had put the value of the antiques, some of which were Wang's dowry from her wealthy capitalist father, at up to 510,000 yuan ($61,000).
The collection was seized from Wang and eluded destruction by radical Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The authorities returned some of her collection when she was released from prison 11 years later.
""They were at Zhongnanhai or they would have all been smashed during the Cultural Revolution,"" Wang said. The Zhongnanhai compound in central Beijing still serves as home and office to many of China's leaders.
Liu, China's former president, was deposed during the Cultural Revolution and died in prison in 1969. He was rehabilitated posthumously in 1980.
Wang said she had deep emotional ties to the collection but these were outweighed by concerns for those living in poverty.
""I would be reluctant to part with what my mother left me without a reason ... (but) my heart aches even more when I see impoverished mothers,"" the former first lady said.
""It shouldn't be like this. The country led by our Communist Party cannot let families be this destitute,"" she said.
China has about 65 million people still struggling to get by with incomes under the official absolute poverty line of 530 yuan ($64) a year, officials say.
In September, Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin vowed to ""gnaw the hard bone"" of poverty by pouring funds into the drive to raise living standards for the poorest segment of the nation by the turn of the century.
The communists, who swept to power in 1949 on public resentment against widespread poverty and corruption, fear the widening gap between rich and poor today could spark social unrest and undermine its grip on power.
China says it reduced the number of people living in abject poverty by five million in 1995.
About 3,500 destitute mothers in western and southwestern China were expected to benefit from Tuesday's auction.
Proceeds would go to an anti-poverty fund headed by the former first lady to lend money to impoverished mothers to help them get started in farming, raise livestock or make handicrafts to earn a living in future, Wang said.
The fund would also provide education and give medical treatment to destitute mothers, she said.",0

""It is still not too late for Japan to stop this reckless gamble,"" the newspaper said in a commentary. ""It is high time for Japan to take measures to stop the game for the sake of the world and its own future.""
The LDP announced last week an election platform that reiterates Tokyo's claim to the East China Sea islands, which Tokyo calls the Senkakus and which Beijing and Taipei call the Diaoyus.
""Japan has not learnt the lesson of its militarist expansion and...it is going into another dangerous game,"" the newspaper said.
On Monday, about 300 Taiwanese and Hong Kong protesters aboard a 50-boat flotilla pierced a Japanese maritime cordon around the islands and briefly raised the flags of Beijing and Taipei on the rocky outcrops in a challenge to Tokyo's claim of sovereignty.
Japan has sought to calm passions in the dispute and asked China and Japan to prevent a recurrence of Monday's landings. Tokyo has said it would not recognise a lighthouse built on one of the islands by Japanese rightwingers this year.
Japanese rightwingers sailed to the islands in July and repaired the lighthouse, rekindling the dispute.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday accused Japan of taking an irresponsibile approach by encouraging landings on the islands by the rightwing groups.
Shen warned that the will of the Chinese people ""cannot be bullied"" and that sovereignty ranked above everything else.
The row was aggravated last week when a Hong Kong activist drowned after diving into stormy seas near the islands as part of a protest against Tokyo's sovereignty claim.
Tokyo's claim dates back to 1895, when it defeated imperial China and seized the uninhabited islands. Japan says the issue is not open for discussion.
China has claimed sovereignty over the islands for centuries.
Taiwan has no diplomatic ties with Japan, which only recognises Beijing's Communist government.
The China Daily commentary also slammed the LDP's election platform for containing an endorsement of visits by cabinet ministers to a Tokyo shrine to Japan's war dead.
""Japanese politicians have waged a war to reverse the verdict on Japan's war shame concluded by the world half a century ago,"" the commentary said.
Japanese prime minister and LDP leader Ryutaro Hashimoto in July broke a decade-long taboo on prime ministerial visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, saying it was time for Japan to stop apologising for honouring its fallen soldiers.
""Such dishonest activities, which reinvigorate militarism, have naturally caused indignation in the war-victimised countries,"" the newspaper commentary said in reference to visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders.
Last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang expressed strong indignation over the LDP's election platform.",0
"Chinese President Jiang Zemin tried to reassure Taiwanese businessmen on Thursday, saying Beijing would not allow political differences to stand in the way of trade and investment.
""We maintain that political differences should not be allowed to affect and interfere with economic cooperation between the two sides,"" state radio quoted Jiang as telling visiting Taiwanese business leaders.
The economies of China and Taiwan were complementary, Jiang said, adding that the two sides should strengthen economic cooperation to benefit the entire Chinese race.
""We will continue to carry out our long-time policy of encouraging Taiwanese businessmen to invest,"" Jiang was quoted as saying. ""No matter what the circumstances, we will protect all legitimate rights of Taiwanese investors.""
A delegation of nearly 80 Taiwanese business leaders and politicians arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are part of the delegation in a private capacity.
Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since 1949 when the nation's Nationalist rulers fled to the island after their defeat by the communists.
Indirect trade and investment has been allowed since the late 1980s, usually through Hong Kong.
Jiang said China has always sought to speed up the establishment of direct trade and transport links with Taiwan.
Beijing has stepped up pressure on the island to lift the ban. Last week it unilaterally announced a set of regulations to pave the way for direct links.
Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport, but Taiwan has been reluctant to remove the curbs, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.
Kao Ching-yuan, head of the delegation, urged Beijing on Wednesday to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded ties.
The talks were suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing views the island as a rebel province and insists it is not entitled to official links with other states.
Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, a major Taiwanese conglomerate, was quoted by state television as saying the Chinese market had great potential and many Taiwanese businessmen were pushing for expanded economic cooperation.
President Enterprises is Taiwan's biggest investor in China.
Kao's visit came less than two weeks after Taiwan's President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.
The Taiwanese delegation was the largest to visit China since a trend of easing tensions was reversed by Lee's mid-1995 U.S. visit.",0
"Leading Chinese dissident Chen Ziming has been placed under tight police surveillance after his release on medical parole and needs permission to consult a doctor, a relative said on Thursday.
""Some conditions (after his parole) are not as good as when (he) was in prison,"" the dissident's sister, Chen Zihua, said after meeting him earlier on Thursday at his home.
""When he was in prison he could still go downstairs for some air,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""(Now) he can't even go downstairs to get some sun... He cannot go out.""
Chen Ziming has been under tight police surveillance since he was released on medical parole and returned to his eighth-floor Beijing home late on Wednesday.
Asked about Chen's plans, the sister said he did not talk about anything besides his wish to get medical treatment.
The dissident needs police permission to see a doctor, the sister said. He has heart, liver and digestion problems. He had been treated for cancer.
He is barred from talking to foreign reporters. Uniformed and plainclothes police on Thursday prevented reporters from approaching Chen's home and that of his parents.
Asked if the dissident was under house arrest, Chen's sister said: ""(I'm) afraid it's a little graver than that. It's just moving the prison from one place to another.""
But his release was a welcome surprise to the family.
""We felt surprised to a certain degree. Of course, (we) are happy (he) could be released,"" the sister said. ""His medical parole...was a little unexpected.""
Chen, 44, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991 for engaging in ""counter-revolutionary"", or subversive, activities during a student-led campaign for democracy that was centred on Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Chen had been singled out by Beijing authorities as the ""black hand"" behind-the-scenes organiser of the demonstrations, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.
He won medical parole in 1994 in a move widely seen as part of a successful bid by Beijing to persuade Washington not to revoke China's Most Favoured Nation trade status on grounds of persistent human rights violations.
Chen was returned to prison on June 25, 1995, after joining calls for Beijing to release political prisoners and reverse its verdict that the Tiananmen Square protests were seditious.
His release on Wednesday came seven days after a Beijing court took less than four hours to convict former student leader Wang Dan and sentence him to 11 years in prison for plotting to subvert the government.
Wang's imprisonment was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's embattled dissidents, most of whom were already either in exile or serving long terms in administrative detention or prison.
Asked if Chen's release was a gift to U.S. President Bill Clinton on his re-election, the sister said: ""It gives (Clinton) face.""
Human rights have long been a major irritant in Sino-U.S. ties already strained by disputes over trade, copyright piracy, arms proliferation and Taiwan.
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to travel to Beijing this month for a visit widely seen as a vital step toward rebuilding the cross-Pacific relationship.",0
"China called on Taiwan on Tuesday to show goodwill by lifting a decades-old ban on direct trade and transport links, saying attempts by the island nation to block such links would be futile.
""Obstructing the three links between the two sides...will be futile...is against the will of the people on both sides,"" a commentary by the Xinhua news agency said of Taiwan's ban on direct trade, transport and mail links with China.
""(We) hope the Taiwan authorities can make a pragmatic, goodwill response,"" said the commentary carried by major newspapers on Tuesday.
Last week, China introduced a series of regulations to pave the way for direct shipping links.
Taiwan has banned direct trade, transport and mail links with China since Mao Zedong's communist army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops to the island at the end of a civil war in 1949.
Indirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s through Hong Kong or a third country.
The commentary accused the Taiwan authorities of creating obstacles to direct trade and transport links in recent years, saying this would not be conducive to prospects for peaceful reunification. The commentary did not explain how it would not be conducive.
China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and has threatened to invade if the island declared independence. It has also sought to push Taipei into diplomatic isolation.
Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, clamour for direct trade and transport links, but Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.
Taiwan says it is committed to reunification but stresses this cannot be achieved overnight.
Last week China heaped pressure on Taiwan by offering to hold political talks to end almost five decades of hostility.
Nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians were scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday for a a high-profile, 12-day visit, despite reservations voiced by the island's leaders about depending too heavily on China.
The visit has aroused attention because the delegation is led by Kao Ching-yuan, a senior member of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party and vice-chairman of President Enterprises, the island's biggest investor in China.
Taiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials.
The trip comes less than two weeks after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding over dependence on the mainland.
The China Times Express newspaper in Taipei said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorate.
The Taiwanese delegation would be the largest to visit China since easing tensions across the Taiwan Strait began to fray in mid-1995 over a landmark, private visit by Taiwan's President Lee to the United States.
In apparent retaliation, China denounced Lee and held intimidatory war games off Taiwan before the island's historic presidential elections in March in which Lee was re-elected.",0
"China's exports climbed again in October due to sluggish domestic demand, faster payment of export tax rebates and an expansion of credit to exporters, newspapers and a government economist said on Wednesday.
The upturn in exports was expected to continue through the first half of 1997, said Wang Jian, a researcher with the cabinet's State Planning Commission.
Exports rose for the fourth consecutive month in October, jumping 23.3 percent to $15.22 billion from a year ago, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper published by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
The healthy exports performance helped the nation register its biggest monthly trade surplus of the year. The surplus stood at $3.91 billion in October compared with $3.2 billion in September, the newspaper said.
""This kind of rebound in exports ... is estimated to last until the first half of next year,"" Wang told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Wang attributed the upturn to slow domestic demand, forcing manufacturers to look to overseas markets.
Also, domestic enterprises had adjusted to a cut in government-paid export tax rebates, he said. The government slashed the rebate on exports of industrial products to 9.0 percent from 14.0 percent on January 1, 1996.
The International Business Daily said exports rebounded because the government sped up the payment of export tax rebates and expanded credit to exporters.
Exports slumped in the first six months of 1996, dented by rising wages and the relative strength of the currency, the renminbi.
A slowdown in government payments of tax rebates to exporters had also discouraged many firms from exporting their goods earlier in the year. Many of those firms focused sales on the domestic market instead.
However, the government has been stepping up payment of export rebates to try to revive exports.
Imports inched up a year-on-year three percent to $11.31 billion in October, the Business Daily said.
The import data showed that the impact of this year's tariff cuts has gradually weakened, it said.
In the first 10 months of this year, China's exports totalled $119.22 billion, mostly unchanged from the same 1995 period, the newspaper said. But imports added up to $107.21 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from the year-ago period.
The latest figures brought the total trade surplus for the January-to-October period to $12.01 billion, it said.
Japan, the United States and Europe remained China's largest export markets.
China's exports to Japan rose a year-on-year 8.6 percent to $24.5 billion in the first 10 months of this year, the daily said. Exports to the United States and Europe increased 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent to $21.3 billion and $18.9 billion respectively.
Machinery and electronic exports totalled $38 billion in the first 10 months, accounting for one-third of total exports and up 11 percent from the year-ago period, the newspaper said.
Exports of toys, furniture, shoes, crude oil and plastic products increased in the first 10 months. But exports of textile yarn and related products, garment, steel and aquatic products all fell, it said.
Imports by foreign-funded enterprises in the first 10 months soared a year-on-year 23 percent to $105.0 billion.
Car imports plunged 39 percent year-on-year between January and October, the newspaper said. It did not elaborate.",0
"China's flamboyant tycoon Mou Qizhong is hounded by creditors, faces lawsuits and investigation for alleged irregularities and cannot leave the country, company officials said.
The embattled chairman of the Land Economic Group, who has been identified by local media as China's second richest man, was down but not out and was counting on Russian-made satellites to bail him out of financial trouble, they said.
""We're in a crisis,"" Chen Fang, spokeswoman for Mou, told Reuters late on Monday. Mou declined repeated requests for an interview.
Domestic creditors had demanded repayment of loans, group officials said. Mou's Land Economic Group owes 200 million yuan ($24.1 million) at home and another 200 million yuan in Hong Kong and Russia.
""Some creditors...have asked for their money back even before the maturity date,"" Chen said, adding that the company was planning to repay the loans gradually.
Domestic banks had refused to grant Mou new loans and the group had given up seeking loans from Chinese banks. ""Abruptly recalling loans could be fatal,"" Chen said in an interview.
At least one investor had demanded its money back, but agreed to convert its equity into a loan, company officials said.
""The major problem we're facing now is circulating funds getting cut off... As a result, many projects are held up,"" Chen said.
Government authorities had cleared Mou of suspicion of tax evasion and of using unlawful funds but he remained under investigation for other unspecified irregularities, company officials said.
The authorities had been dragging their feet on renewing his passport apparently out of fear that he may flee the country and join his wife and three sons in the United States. Mou hopes to visit the United States next month.
Salaries of employees were slashed to 270 yuan a month -- China's urban minimum wage -- in July and August and were 600 yuan in September from an average of 2,000 yuan a month in the past, the officials said. About 50 people have resigned, leaving some 300.
A contractor in Inner Mongolia had sued the Land Group for allegedly defaulting on a contract, and court officials foreclosed on company cars and office equipment in August.
""Many people say that this could be what is called in Buddhism an inexorable doom for Mr Mou or the Land Group,"" Chen said.
Chen blamed the woes of Mou on the media ""surrounding and attacking"" him since March as well as a smear campaign by former employees and a government credit squeeze to curb inflation.
""But the Land Group will not collapse,"" she said.
Mou plans to raise an unspecified amount of money through a planned share issue, for two Russian-made GALS communications satellites he owns, on the Hong Kong stock exchange, officials said.
The first was launched in January 1994 and the second in November 1995. Russia launched both satellites in Kazakhstan.
In addition, Mou has bought a 30 percent stake in a company that will develop, manufacture and launch two Russian-made Intersputnik communications satellites.
The first of the two satellites is due to be launched from Kazakhstan in late 1998.
The satellites were expected to bring Mou net profits of $500 million and bail him out of his current crisis, Chen said.
The group has assets worth 1.2 billion yuan and liabilities of just 400 million yuan.
It is not Mou's first crisis. He was sentenced to death but eluded execution in the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution for criticising chairman Mao Zedong.
Mou was released from prison in 1979 and established his company the following year. He was arrested again and jailed for one year on a charge of speculating in the early 1980s.
He ran up huge debts in the mid 1980s but managed to bounce back by importing small refrigerators from South Korea at low tariff rates, raking in millions of yuan.",0
"Chinese dissident Wang Dan has appealed against his 11-year jail sentence for plotting to subvert the government, but his mother said on Tuesday she held little hope of an acquittal or a lighter sentence.
Wang Lingyun said she hoped U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and German President Roman Herzog would raise her son's predicament in their meetings with Chinese leaders when they visit China later this month.
""Wang Dan... should be acquitted because... he's innocent,"" she told Reuters by telephone. ""We hope for an acquittal or a reduced sentence... but it is unlikely.""
Wang Lingyun, who acted as one of two defence lawyers in her son's case, said court officials had asked her to submit a written defence for the appeal and that family members may not be allowed to attend the appeals court trial.
Experts on China's legal system have said the chances of the appeals court overturning the lower court's verdict were slim.
An official of the Beijing Higher People's Court said the 27-year-old dissident had filed his appeal. She declined to provide further details.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours last Wednesday to convict and sentence Wang, who had already served four years in prison for his role as a leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for democracy that were crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.
On Monday, visiting Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said he had expressed his disapproval to Chinese Premier Li Peng over the jailing of Wang.
A foreign ministry spokesman defended China at a news briefing on Tuesday, saying Beijing would not impose its laws on others and that foreign countries should take a similar stance.
The spokesman also said China opposed using human rights as a pretext to interfere in the internal affairs of any country.
An international human rights group denounced what it said was the ""secret trial"" of Wang on a trumped-up charge.
""What (the court) brought to bear on Wang Dan was a secret trial in which the facts were deliberately hidden and the truth distorted,"" the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement made available to Reuters by facsimile.
""A fabricated charge was used to wantonly convict Wang Dan,"" the group said. ""Wang Dan's case... is suppression and persecution of thought and speech by the Chinese government.""
When told during the trial of his right to seek the removal of any biased judges, Wang demanded all judges and prosecutors be removed from the case. The tribunal rejected his request after a few minutes of deliberation, the group said.
China said it was an open and fair trial but Human Rights in China said no foreign reporters, diplomats or other international observers were allowed to attend.
The group said more than 10 people wearing tags identifying themselves as reporters attended the trial but there was no mention of the conviction in the local Chinese-language media.
The jailing of Wang was the latest in a series of crushing blows to China's struggling pro-democracy movement. Most dissidents have already been forced into exile or are serving long sentences in prison or labour camps.
Human Rights in China accused the official Xinhua news agency of preparing English-language stories about the results of the trial and an interview with the chief judge even before the verdict was delivered.
Asked to comment, an official of the foreign affairs office of Xinhua said: ""It is not necessary to find out whether the story was prepared before or after the sentencing... News agencies have different ways and practices of releasing news.""
After breaking the news of Wang's conviction, it took Xinhua only 1-1/2 hours to put out a 54-paragraph story on the interview with the chief judge.",0
"One of China's most prominent dissidents, Wang Dan, will likely receive a harsh sentence for the charge of plotting to overthrow the government, his mother said on Tuesday.
Wang would plead not guilty to the capital charge when his trial at the Beijing Intermediate People's Court begins on Wednesday, said the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun.
""The court...giving my son a harsh sentence even though he is innocent is very likely to happen,"" Wang Lingyun told Reuters. ""I dare not rule it out.""
She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days, adding that family members have been under surveillance in recent weeks.
Wang Dan, 26, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum of 10 years in prison and a maximum penalty of death for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government.
The court has refused to give details of Wang's trial other than that the dissident has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government. But one official has said Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of an acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
The dissident's family has found a lawyer willing to defend the former student leader after being given just one day in which to do so.
The human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers are generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.
Wang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
The Chinese authorities have been quiet on a request by the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang's trial, diplomats said.
French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affairs.
Beijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcomed.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.
The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health has deteriorated during his detention.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was active after his parole in 1993, defying persistent police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.",0
"Taiwanese business leader Kao Ching-yuan on Wednesday urged Beijing to resume talks with Taiwan, saying the island's investors would lose confidence in China if political friction impeded relations.
""If the relations between the two sides are kept at a low ebb due to political and ideological problems... Taiwanese businessmen will lose confidence because of higher risks,"" said Kao, vice-chairman of President Enterprises, Taiwan's biggest investor in China.
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing earlier told the same seminar in Beijing no one could stand in the way of direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan which have been banned by the island since 1949.
Kao is heading a delegation of nearly 80 prominent Taiwanese business leaders and politicians who arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a high-profile visit. Taiwanese economic officials are visiting in a private capacity.
Kao called for the resumption of talks suspended last year after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark trip to the United States. Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has sought to push the island into diplomatic isolation.
""I would like to suggest here... that the two sides resume as soon as possible talks on trade and investment,"" Kao said.
Taiwanese newspapers said Kao would meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other senior officials during the current trip, which comes less than two weeks after President Lee called for a review of economic policy toward China with the aim of avoiding overdependence on the mainland.
Taipei's China Times Express newspaper said on Sunday that Taiwan's economic planners had drawn up measures -- including contingency plans to restrict Taiwanese investment on the mainland -- if Taiwan-China relations deteriorated.
Li, the Chinese vice-premier, took a swipe at President Lee, saying no one could block direct trade and transport links between China and Taiwan, rivals from the time of the Chinese civil war that ended in 1949.
""Economic development between the two sides is the general trend and no single person can obstruct this,"" Li said.
""Any person who tries to place artificial barriers to restrict economic cooperation is going against the will of the people of the two sides,"" he said.
He also told the seminar he hoped Taiwan authorities would allow direct links as soon as possible.
Indirect links between the two sides have been allowed since the late 1980s, through Hong Kong or a third country.
Many Taiwanese businessmen, who have poured more than $20 billion into China, are eager for direct trade and transport links. But Taiwan has been reluctant to lift the ban, which it views as its last bargaining chip in talks with the communists.

"The trial of prominent Chinese dissident and former student leader Wang Dan for the capital charge of plotting to overthrow the government is expected to be held behind closed doors soon, a family member said on Tuesday.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court had yet to inform Wang's family of the trial date, the relative said.
The court was widely expected to fill the limited number of courtroom seats with carefully selected people to keep away foreign reporters and fellow dissidents.
""Only the people notified by the court can attend the trial. Others cannot attend,"" the family member said in a telephone interview.
""In reality, the trial will not be open...but the court will not admit it is not an open trial,"" the relative said. ""It tells a group of people to attend and calls this an open trial.""
A court official, contacted by telephone, declined to comment.
If last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement, was an indication, Wang's trial would be kept from public view, a political activist said. Dissidents and foreign reporters were barred from Wei's trial.
Court officials have confirmed that Wang, detained since May 1995, has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government -- a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death and a minimum of 10 years in prison.
They have not given further details of the trial though one official said that Wang could appeal to the Higher People's Court if convicted.
Relatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.
Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, a 61-year-old museum researcher who has no background in law, has said she would defend her son in court. Chinese law allows an accused to be defended by a family member.
It also states that only lawyers can meet detained defendants. Wang's mother was allowed to meet the dissident at a detention centre in Beijing on Monday because she was his legal counsel.
The dissident was mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, Wang's mother told a Hong Kong-based group that monitors human rights in China.
""Wang Dan said he has not done anything wrong...He is very calm...and psychologically prepared for a heavy sentence,"" the group quoted the mother as saying.
""She is very worried about his health,"" the group said.
It added that Wang had back, throat and prostate problems.
""In the condition that Wang Dan is in, it would be difficult for him to hold out under another long prison sentence,"" it quoted the mother as saying.
Wang, 26, has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
Wang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted Wei Jingsheng implicated Wang.
The verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people ""convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan"". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.

"China on Tuesday slammed Taiwan for failing to crack down on a new opposition party seeking independence for the island and warned that separatism was ""a road to death"".
""Not only do the Taiwan authorities fail to ban the formation of the Taiwan Independence Party, but they also tolerate it,"" a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, said.
""The self-proclaimed anti-independence stand of the Taiwan authorities is a double-faced practice that deceives others as well as themselves,"" the official People's Daily quoted the spokesman as saying.
Beijing has regarded Taiwan as a rebel province since Mao Zedong's Red Army defeated and drove Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops into exile in Taiwan at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.
A group of Taiwanese activists plan to break away from Taiwan's main opposition party and form the Taiwan Independence Party on December 12.
China has threatened to invade if Taiwan declared independence. China conducted missile tests and war games off Taiwan last March in the run-up to the island's first direct presidential elections to cow Taipei into abandoning any dreams of independence.
""Taiwan independence is a road to death that cannot be walked because it is blocked,"" the spokesman said.
The spokesman described the party as a ""reactional political organisation"" with the explicit purpose of splitting the motherland.
""The Taiwan authorities should adopt realistic anti-independence action as soon as possible. Compatriots on the two sides are waiting to see,"" the spokesman said.
""The Chinese government and the Chinese people will definitely not sit back idly and do nothing about it,"" the spokesman warned.
""Their scheme will never succeed,"" he said of the new party's drive for independence.
Taiwan says it is committed to reunification, but stresses that this cannot be achieved overnight and says China must democratise.
Beijing's criticism came a day after Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui blamed China for deadlocked relations between the two.
Referring to the Communist authorities, Lee said in a speech on Monday: ""They adopted a hegemonic attitude and stubborn policy toward Taiwan, singlehandedly blocked the development of history and caused the stalemate of cross-Strait relations.""
The island maintains an official policy of anti-independence, but has decriminalised advocacy of independence, saying such calls are within the bounds of freedom of speech.
Ties between Beijing and Taipei, which began to thaw in the late 1980s, took an icy plunge after a landmark, private visit by Lee to the United States in June 1995.
China, which has sought to push Taiwan into diplomatic isolation, saw the trip as a bid to raise the island's international profile.
Beijing has stepped up its reunification overture in recent months, calling for political talks to end almost five decades of hostility.
China unilaterally introduced a series of regulations last August to pave the way for direct shipping links with Taiwan.
Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since 1949, but allows indirect links through Hong Kong or third countries. Taiwan is reluctant to lift the ban lest the island become an economic hostage to China.",0
"Sun Microsystems Inc. Tuesday introduced its first network computer, the JavaStation, in a direct challenge to Microsoft and Intel, the dominant players in the industry.
Saying the company was ushering in a new era of computing, Sun Chief Executive Officer Scott McNealy unveiled a sleek, charcoal-grey device, about nine inches by 12 inches, with no disk drives or slots or floppy disks, to allow access to networks of computers and the Internet, at a cost of $742.
Sun, Oracle Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. are challenging the computer industry's dominant ""Wintel"" architecture from Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. with the new low-cost, low-maintenance network computers, or ""NCs.""
""Today you'll see why the network is the computer and has been since 1984,"" McNealy said, reiterating Sun's mantra.
The JavaStation is targeted at businesses. Sun said the machines might eventually be offered into the consumer market by cable TV and telecommunications firms as Internet access devices, but it declined to say when that might happen.
With Java, software applications can be written in one language and distributed across networks and diverse computers and computing environments, from mainframes to minicomputers to personal computers and now to the new NCs.
""Java computing is going to be as powerful as the mainframe in the '60s, the minicomputer in the '70s and the PC environment of the '80s,"" said Ed Zander, president of Sun Micro's Computer Co.
Sun introduced three versions of the JavaStation. The lowest cost, $742 version does not include a monitor or a keyboard. The systems are aimed at corporate users of Sun workstations and host computers, but can also access Microsoft PC applications from a host computer running Windows NT.
At a news conference in New York, Sun executives said they did not expect the new machines to take the place of personal computers, but they also professed amazement at the news conference Microsoft held Monday.
Microsoft, with several major players in the PC industry, unveiled its own ""NetPC"" strategy aimed at driving down the cost of PC ownership, with new features in Windows for network management, calling it ""Zero Administration.""
""I have never seen such totally reactive vapour,"" Zander told reporters. ""We must really have touched a nerve.""
McNealy said it was simply a move by the ""old-line legacy Wintel"" trying to hold onto its position in the world. Wintel refers to the combination of Microsoft operating systems and Intel chips.
""People call it a PC on a diet, I call it a PC in a corset, with the strings pulled too tight and a bright red face,"" McNealy said, referring to the Microsoft initiative.
But even with all the hype surrounding the industry's latest infatuation, Sun executives and analysts were not expecting big sales of the NC, nor will the JavaStation become a big percentage of Sun's hardware sales.
""This thing is a small percentage of the total product environment, it will help sell more servers,"" Zander told Reuters.
""Maybe a couple of years from now it will begin competing with low-end PCs,"" said Evan Quinn at International Data Corp., noting Sun's network computing strategy is tied to future expansion of its Java technology.
Sun said the entry level model, containing eight megabytes of memory, will ship beginning in December. A fully configured system, which includes memory, keyboard, a mouse and 14-inch monitor, will cost $995.
The company also said it will offer a JavaStation with 16 megabytes of memory, a mouse, keyboard and a 17-inch monitor for $1,565. The JavaStation also has a small operating system, the Java OS, taking up less than three megabytes of memory.
While the devices are lower cost than the typical PC, which can range in cost from $1,500 to $3,000, Sun executives said their customers will save money as the costs of PC ownership for businesses escalate and are now estimated at anywhere from $6,000 to $12,000 a year, per PC.
Sun said a JavaStation costs about $2,500 a year to maintain, or about $7,500 for three years, potentially saving corporations millions of dollars.",0
"EchoStar Communications Corp. -- the upstart in the direct broadcast satellite television business -- gave the nascent industry a major jolt this month with a sharp price cut.
The jolt reverberated earlier this week when Thomson, the U.S. unit of France's Thomson-CSF, which dominates the satellite TV dish market, matched EchoStar's new price at $199 for a satellite dish.
Thomson executives said the new price will surely shake up the industry and fuel sales for what is said to be the fastest growing consumer electronics product ever -- one that even now is taking market share from the cable industry.
""It will completely change the nature of the business,"" said Joe Clayton, an executive vice president at Thomson.
Thomson's move cut the price of the RCA brand digital satellite system by as much as $200 a unit. Combined with a $200 cash back offer by programming providers DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., and U.S. Satellite Broadcasting Co., it cut the total price to $199 for consumers who pre-pay for one year of programming.
Programming costs from $29.95 a month for 70 channels on DirecTV to $44.95 a month for all 175 channels on DirecTV.
The lower price -- while welcome for consumers -- will make it harder for new entrants to break into the market and make a profit.
Other consumer electronics giants, Uniden America Corp., Toshiba America Consumer Products Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Matsushita Electric Corp of America have announced plans to introduce new DSS systems later this year.
Thomson will make the dishes for Toshiba and Panasonic.
""We know the telcos and the cable companies are getting more involved,"" Clayton said. ""We are going to capitalise on our strengths now.""
He added that the $199 price will make the ""awareness base explode.""
Thomson has an estimated 45 percent of the digital satellite system dish market, which amounted to 3.4 million units worldwide at the end of July, according to the Carmel Group.
""It's been a real winner for them,"" said Jimmy Schaeffler, an analyst at the market research firm in Carmel, Calif. ""Plus it has launched them into the international marketplace.""
Schaeffler said satellite television is gaining markets outside the United States where there is no cable service because it does not require installing massive cable systems.
""Most of the rest of the world is not very cable wired, so there is a clear opportunity for direct broadcast satellite,"" Schaeffler said. Satellite TV is also becoming big in this country while vaunted digital cable systems undergo trials.
New competitors see an opportunity in digital satellites -- a technology that is already here and working. MCI Communications, aligned with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd, already has a valuable U.S. satellite slot.
The move to cut prices to gain market share is changing the industry, which Clayton said is moving more toward a cellular telephone model, where the hardware is the lowest cost -- sometimes practically nothing -- and revenues come from services and programming.
""They have to fight within the industry and competitors from outside the industry,"" Schaeffler said. ""They are doing the rebates because of the market share. It's a combination of EchoStar pushing everyone to a lower price point nationally and the effort to maintain and acquire future markets.""
Asked how low prices of satellite dishes could go, Clayton joked that he had never seen prices in consumer electronics products go up. Other analysts also expect prices to keep falling.
""Maybe Charlie will take it to zero, but I don't think we will,"" Clayton said of EchoStar Chairman Charles Ergen.
A spokeswoman said Englewood, Colo.-based EchoStar, which launched its satellite network in March, already has 125,000 subscribers for its programming, which has 40 TV channels and 30 channels of music, compared with 175 channels offered by DirecTV.
The launch next month of a second satellite will increase its offerings to up to 200 channels, EchoStar said.",0
"Compaq Computer Corp., the world's largest personal computer maker, will launch its first computer workstations this week with low-cost entrants that already have at least one workstation maker scrambling.
""They have a fighting chance to really threaten some of the traditional vendors,"" said Keren Seymour, an analyst with International Data Corp., a market research firm.
On Tuesday Compaq will unveil three systems in the ""personal workstation"" area, the faster-growing segment of the $15.1 billion market for workstations -- high-powered computers used by engineers and designers to perform complex calculations requiring enormous power.
Traditional workstations run on the UNIX operating system and the market has been dominated by Sun Microsystems Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
But in the past two years, Microsoft Corp's Windows NT operating system has been making major inroads and a host of companies now develop lower-cost workstations running NT.
According to IDC, the personal workstation market -- workstations selling at prices from $4,500 to $10,000 -- is growing at a faster pace than traditional, UNIX-based arena, where systems cost from $17,000 up to $100,000.
While Windows NT cannot yet handle some of the memory-intensive, highly technical applications, Seymour said, NT-based workstations are widely used for financial modeling, animation, and computer-aided design.
Engineers can also run their desktop applications, such as spreadsheets, word processing, and electronic mail, on the same system, instead of having two separate computer systems.
""It's growing at an average rate of 44 percent a year,"" Seymour said of the personal workstation area, compared with traditional workstation growth of 7.5 percent, on a compounded annual growth rate, through the year 2000.
Already, Houston-based Compaq's expected entry in the market has at least one major vendor nervous.
Last week, IBM held a hastily-arranged conference call for analysts to discuss the formation of a new business unit that will develop Intel-based workstations running NT.
""It was an answer to Compaq's initiative,"" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. Otherwise, he asked, ""Why would IBM give a heads up for a product that isn't ready until March?""
IBM's current line of workstations, the RS/6000 family, are designed around IBM's PowerPC chip and run on the UNIX operating system. In its third-quarter earnings report, however, IBM said its workstation business was flat, another indicator of the increasingly popularity of the lower-cost NT-based machines.
Compaq is expected to introduce three models in the $5,000 to $10,000 range, IDC's Seymour said. A Compaq spokeswoman declined to comment on the products to be unveiled Tuesday.
PC Week, an industry trade magazine, reported last week that Compaq will price its entry-level workstation at $5,000, targeted to molecular modeling and computer-aided design.
Two other models, for the animation creation business, are priced from $8,000 to $10,000, PC Week said.
As part of its recent product revamp, Silicon Graphics Inc., long a leader in the animiation workstation area, also recently introduced a less-expensive model called the O2, which runs on UNIX, in response to the growth in the NT-based machines.
But analysts said SGI and Sun Micro will not likely embrace the Microsoft operating system NT anytime soon, even though it is poised to become the faster-growing workstation segment.
""Sun and SGI would rather die than do NT,"" said Seymour. ""That's the unfortunate thing ... At some point, the NT market share is going to be bigger than theirs.""",0
"International Business Machines Corp. will update its strategy for electronic commerce Tuesday, and will unveil new partners and show examples of projects already in the works.
Electronic commerce is a widely used buzz word in the computer industry which refers to buying and selling goods and services or conducting transactions over computer networks, including the globe-spanning Internet.
For IBM, the world's largest computer maker, electronic commerce is a potentially huge opportunity to provide products and services to help its customers do business online.
An IBM spokesman declined to provide any details, except to say that IBM will provide an update on where it is now and where it is going in electronic commerce.
Top executives from IBM's Lotus Development Corp. subsidiary, its Internet division and its just-announced Network Computer unit will hold a news conference.
Analysts said IBM plans to announce several new partners for various applications it has developed, targeted at specific industries, such as an automotive company which is co-developing an auto-loan application on the Internet.
IBM will also unveil and demonstrate an application targeted at the petroleum industry, a Web site called PetroConnect that will let energy companies share geological information over the Internet to aid in their oil-exploration searches.
Analysts also expect the computer giant to add 10 new retailers to its World Mall, its shopping site on the Internet targeted at consumers.
IBM will also officially roll out its Network Computer division and possibly some new models of the Network Station, its first network computer, aimed at a specific industries.
Earlier Monday, IBM announced that it had formed a unit to focus all its development and marketing efforts in the embryonic market for these scaled-down computer devices.
Analysts said that, while electronic commerce represents a big opportunity for IBM and the rest of the computer industry, the market is still so young that it is hard to estimate what revenues will be, where they will come from and how long it will take for these ventures to be profitable.
""I think IBM is very well poised to make money from all of these things, but it will be a year or two before anything happens,"" said Stan Dolberg, a Forrester Research analyst.
""The Internet commerce offerings, whether they are services or products, have to be really focused on a specific industry to be complete,"" Dolberg added.
Indeed, IBM is developing many industry-specific services, such as its petroleum industry Web service, and the automotive industry application. IBM will also announce a partnership with Charles Schwab Corp., the discount brokerage firm that has already been very active in developing online brokerage and trading services.
But it is not yet clear whether IBM will make much money from services and transactions, of which it will get a piece.",0

"International Business Machines Corp. Chairman Louis Gerstner on Wednesday warned the computer industry of a backlash against the Internet as confusion and feuding reigns among corporate rivals.
""A lot of what has gone on is just plain confusing,"" Gerstner said in a keynote speech at the Internet World trade show in New York. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see an Internet backlash soon.""
He said industry wars over Internet browser software, programming languages, hardware and continuing hype may contribute to corporate and consumer disillusionment about the Internet.
""As an industry, we are not shy about telling people how beautiful our babies are, long before they are born,"" Gerstner said, adding that customers have to sort out the hype and ""food fights"" by sparring companies.
Gerstner said many were wondering where money is to be made on the Internet amid what he characterised as hype that seems to be leaving out customers and their needs.
""People ask 'Is there real money to be made on the Internet?' and I say, 'Yes there is,'"" Gerstner said, adding that money will be made by companies that can solve customers' problems and make it easy to do things like banking on the Internet.
Gerstner said IBM's approach to the Internet was to work closely with customers and develop the products they need, such as its work with the discount brokerage Charles Schwab, which now offers stock trading over the Internet.
""Schwab expects to capture as many customers with the Internet over the next year as they have over the past 13 years,"" Gerstner said.
One of the industry ""food fights"" that Gerstner singled out was Microsoft Corp.s effort to develop software based on Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java language to design programmes that only run on Microsoft's Windows operating system.
The Java language has been much heralded in the computer industry because of its ""write-once, run-anywhere"" capability, which lets programmes written in Java run on any computer system. Because of this feature, Java has become a popular programming language for the Internet and networked computers.
""Let's not blow this,"" Gerstner said. ""Let's not do to Java what the industry did to Unix,"" the high-performance operating system which splintered off into more than 20 versions.
At Internet World on Wednesday, Sun Microsystems unveiled an alliance with IBM and other major companies, which are all backing a move to standardise and certify one version of the Java language.
""Gerstner is taking his guidance from customers and not from industry conflicts,"" said Sam Albert, an industry consultant based in Scarsdale, N.Y. ""He did a lot to de-hype the industry.""
Gerstner also reiterated his plea that the industry make things easier for users. He showed a video of IBM's voice recognition technology, which enables computer users to give simple commands to surf the World Wide Web.
He said IBM's voice recognition software for the Internet is now available in beta, or experimental form, and that users could download it for free, starting Wednesday, from IBM's Web site, http://www.ibm.com.",0
"International Business Machines Corp. Monday reported a third-quarter profit that came in a shade better than Wall Street had expected, boosted by strong sales of personal computers and services.
The world's largest computer maker said net earnings were $1.29 billion, or $2.45 a share, for the quarter, compared with a loss of $538 million, or 96 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.
Excluding a one-time charge of $1.8 billion related to its Lotus Development Corp. acquisition from the year-ago period, IBM's earnings were $1.3 billion in the 1995 quarter.
Sales grew 8 percent to $18.06 billion from $16.75 billion on the strength of PCs, minicomputers and computer services, IBM said. As expected, sales of mainframe computers declined.
Wall Street took IBM shares for a rollercoast ride after the report. They fell initially, then rallied on comments by the chief financial officer, and closed a fraction higher.
The midday rally took IBM to a new high for the year of $135.375. The stock closed at $130, up 75 cents.
The rally followed remarks by Chief Financial Officer G. Richard Thoman, who said in a meeting with analysts that he was ""very comfortable"" with the computer giant's prospects for the rest of 1996.
""I feel very good about the quarter and very good about the year,"" Thoman said.
But analysts still were concerned about company warnings that currency exchange rates, low prices for memory chips and higher-than-expected restructuring costs would hurt fourth quarter results.
""There were some cautionary comments about the fourth quarter,"" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst who was among several who lowered their fourth quarter profit estimates.
Analysts said they generally were pleased with IBM's ongoing cost-cutting, its successful transition to new products in all its hardware areas and its investments in its growth. Revenue growth was also better than expected.
""I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,"" said Stephen Dube, an analyst with Wasserstein Perrella.
While mainframe computers no longer generate sales growth for Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM, they remain one of the company's important profit centres.
Thoman told analysts that more of IBM's mainframes sales were coming through its computer services business, and that IBM will not see the full impact of sales in one quarter for its new machines.
""If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract ... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,"" Thoman said in an interview, citing an example.
The company said revenues were higher in North America, Asia and Latin America but were flat in Europe. Revenue at its services division grew 26 percent to $3.9 billion, IBM said.
Total hardware sales rose 8 percent to $8.4 billion. PC sales, AS/400 minicomputers, and storage systems were up, while RS/6000 work stations, mainframes, and semiconductors fell.
IBM said pricing pressures hurt its semiconductor business.
Software revenues were off 1 percent to $3.1 billion, largely due to a decline in host-based software, which runs on mainframes. Distributed software revenues grew significantly from the 1995 period. Maintenance revenues fell 7 percent to $1.8 billion.",0

For example, in its World Avenue consumer retailing site on the Internet, IBM receives a start-up fee from its vendors and it gets a five percent commission from its retailing partners on sales and a monthly maintentance charge.
""What they are trying to do is build a recurring revenue stream,"" said John Jones of Salomon Brothers. ""They are trying to get into as many aspects of network computing as they can.""
Some analysts said that, of all IBM's electronic commerce ventures, the World Avenue site is the least likely to succeed, because it does not add a great deal of value, other than the convenience of not leaving your home to shop.
""Malls on the Internet are not what people want,"" said Forrester's Dolberg. ""If they want a mall, they want products grouped together by categories, say like shoes, so they can comparison shop...The Internet itself is like a whole mall, where a lot of different things are already grouped together.""
Other recent Internet shopping mall efforts have failed, such as MCI Communications Corp's MCI Marketplace.

"Netscape Communications Corp. Tuesday unveiled a line of low-cost software to make corporate networks more like the Internet and said that it would ""embrace"" archrival Microsoft Corp.'s products as part of its war for control of the corporate software market.
Netscape is under heavy attack from software behemoth Microsoft, which is seeking to wrestle away some of Netscape's dominant share in both Internet and intranet software.
The Mountain View, Calif.-based upstart has about 80 percent of the Internet browser software arena with its Navigator software and between 60 percent to 70 percent of the exploding ""intranet"" market.
A corporate ""intranet"" is a computer network designed around Internet technology and open standards.
As part of its plan to try to hold onto its lead and to gain entree to more companies, Netscape unveiled several products for the corporate market and said it was ""embracing"" Microsoft applications software and its operating systems because many potential customers rely on Microsoft products.
""We are very hard-core about ... fitting into our customers' 'legacy' systems,"" Marc Andreessen, co-founder and senior vice president of technology at Netscape, told a news conference, in one of many jabs at Microsoft.
""Legacy systems"" is a term in the industry that usually refers to the established, older technology running a corporation, such as mainframe computers.
Netscape stock dipped 62.5 cents to $44.25, while Microsoft rose $2.25 to $138.875 on Nasdaq.
Netscape announced several new intranet products, including new software incorporating the latest upgrade of its popular Navigator Web browser, Version 4.0, and priced them way below similar offerings by both Microsoft and Lotus Development Corp., Netscape said.
One new software product, Netscape Communicator, combines Navigator and other components: Composer, to create documents in the hypertext markup language (HTML) used on the Internet's World Wide Web; Messenger, an electronic mail application; Collabra group discussion software; and the Netscape Inbox Direct service, which delivers messages and news stories to an e-mail address daily at no extra cost.
Netscape Communicator will replace the current Navigator software for consumers. Communicator is priced at $49 for the standard version and $79 for the professional edition, per user.
Netscape expects to make Communicator available by next year's first quarter for 17 major computer operating systems, including Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and Apple's Macintosh.
Users of Navigator 3.0 who have purchased a subscription will receive an upgrade to Communicator at no charge.
Netscape also introduced an upgrade of its SuiteSpot software, which manages the server computers that run corporate networks.
SuiteSpot is priced at $57,900 for 1,000 users. This compares with prices of $73,590 to $279,590 for competing products from Microsoft and Lotus, Netscape said.
Netscape also unveiled an initiative to help corporate users make it easier to use its software with core Microsoft products, such as its Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems and Microsoft Office with Netscape products.
Analysts said Netscape is trying to appeal to a whole new group of corporations by enabling its software to run with the huge installed base of Microsoft-based PCs and servers.
""The strategy is not to scare away the IT (information technology) managers,"" said Eric Brown, a Forrester Research analyst.
Netscape's not-so-friendly bear hug of Microsoft is part of the David-and-Goliath war with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft, the world's No. 1 software company, for control of the Web browser market and more importantly, control of the corporate network. Netscape already derives 80 percent of it revenues from sales of intranet software.
But Netscape acknowledged it may lose some share in the future intranet software market, which Forrester Research is forecasting to reach $10 billion by 2000.
""Dominance is hard to measure,"" Andreessen said in an interview. ""I think we can get at least 50 percent of the intranet software market in five years.""
According to a recent Hambrecht & Quist survey of 200 companies, Netscape now has about 60 percent of corporate intranets, Microsoft's BackOffice has 30 percent and International Business Machines Corp.'s Lotus Notes 10 percent.
Netscape's Navigator software has created a huge brand name and a ""calling card,"" giving it entree to major  corporations. Now the company must execute its strategy and build a sales infrastructure, Andreessen said, a major challenge as its growth continues to explode.
The company, which went public in August 1995, is expected to grow to about 1,700 employees by year-end, up from about 400 at the time of its initial public offering, Andreessen said.
Andreessen added that Netscape has not abandoned its consumer focus in favor of the corporate user.
Netscape also signed deals with more than 70 manufacturing partners, including Apple Computer Inc., Compaq Computer Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp., Ing. C. Olivetti & C. SpA, Siemens Nixdorf and Sun Microsystems Inc.",0
"Unisys Corp. posted improved results in the third quarter, the company said Wednesday, as its new business structure began to pay off, while Stratus Computer Inc. reported better-than-expected profits.
Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., reported a third quarter profit of $14.2 million, but a loss of 9 cents a share after paying $30.2 million in dividends on preferred stock. That compared with a net loss of $32.2 million, or 36 cents a share a year ago.
Revenues for the third quarter were $1.63 billion, up 9 percent from $1.49 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Unisys said revenues were up at each of its three business units: information services, computer systems and computer services. The three units were formed in a restructuring.
""After nine months of operations under the new business structure, our three businesses ... are more cost-competitive, streamlined, and focused on capturing opportunities in their respective markets,"" said James Unruh, chairman and CEO.
Unisys shares closed at $6.875, up 37.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Unisys said its computer systems group has made excellent progress in working through a major product transition to its new lower-cost mainframes, which have experienced a delay as it tested problems with a new chip.
Unisys said while the transition continued to affect its results, sales of computer systems were up 14 percent and profitability in this unit ""rebounded nicely"" in the quarter.
Analysts said a sale of more than 50,000 election systems in Brazil helped its computer systems unit. Revenue increased strongly both in the United States and internationally.
""The Brazilian deal was over $50 million,"" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst.
Unisys said it planned to meet its revised shipment schedule for its new mainframe computers, which are a major transition to a new lower-cost architecture. Analysts said they expected the high-end versions of these systems to begin shipping around March and April.
Separately, Stratus Computer Inc. of Marlboro, Mass., reported a better-than-expected third quarter, citing a positive contribution from its once-beleaguered software business and improved sales of its new computers.
Stratus reported third quarter income of $10.8 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with a loss of $9.3 million, or 40 cents a share in the third quarter of 1995.
Revenues totalled $150 million vs. $151 million last year.
Stratus's results were better than Wall Street expectations. According to First Call, the consensus estimate was for third quarter earnings of 42 cents a share. The company's shares closed at $24.25, up 25 cents, on the NYSE.
Stratus said its software business contributed to earnings for the first time this year, as the benefits of its recent restructuring began to take effect.
""With a sharpened focus on the best opportunities, we expect that results will continue to improve in this part of our business,"" said Bill Foster, chairman and CEO, in a statement. Stratus restructured its software unit in the second quarter.
Hardware revenues were up 15 percent on a sequential basis and were up 5 percent vs. the year-ago period, as its Continuum Series computer line saw strong sales growth. It expects even stronger Continuum growth in the current quarter.
Jones of Salomon said its new Radio systems, which run Microsoft Corp.'s NT operating system, will also be a contributor when it begins volume shipments this quarter.
Stratus develops so-called fault-tolerant computers specifically designed with a backup system in case of system failures.",0
"Prodigy Inc. said Wednesday that on Monday it will launch its Internet-based version of the Prodigy online service, called Prodigy Internet, with two pricing models, including a flat-rate plan of $19.95 a month for unlimited service.
The company said its introduction of Prodigy Internet makes it the first of the original three commercial online service companies to offer its rebuilt service, embracing the open technological and content standards of the Internet, the global computer network.
Prodigy also said its Internet focus will form the basis of its international expansion plans, and that it will offer a Spanish-language version of Prodigy Internet in Mexico early next year.
Sources close to the White Plains, N.Y.-based company said the online service plans to spend about $100 million in 1997 to market the new service, through advertising in newspapers, magazines, trade journals and radio, but for now it has no plans for television, because it feels it has an established brand name.
Prodigy Internet is targeted at the ""New to the Net"" market and the 90 percent of American homes that have yet to sign up for an online or Internet service provider.
""The focus of the new offering is certainly not focused at our existing subscriber base,"" company President Paul Delacey, said in a telephone interview. ""It's focused at the very broad market out there who are not current users or who are users of bare-bones ISPs (Internet service providers), who are looking for more for their money.""
Prodigy Internet is designed to overcome current limitations in navigating the Internet while also addressing the fears and anxieties that many Internet novices experience.
Prodigy Internet would offer two pricing schemes -- a low-cost, entry-level plan for low-volume users and a flat-rate plan for Internet enthusiasts.
The company said its basic plan costs $9.95 a month for 10 hours usage of both regular Prodigy and Internet content, with additional hours at $2.50 each.
The other plan costs $19.95 a month and provides unlimited access to Prodigy, Prodigy Internet and add-on features not available elsewhere, the company said .
Prodigy will still offer its current proprietary online service, which it is calling Prodigy Classic, but it will offer incentives for its current members to migrate to Prodigy Internet, such as two months free, with 20 hours of usage.
""We expect that it's going to be a long, protracted service,"" Delacey said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we are still offering Prodigy Classic a few years from now.""
Prodigy will be the first to deliver an Internet-based service of the three major online service providers.
One rival, CompuServe Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, has announced plans to rebuild its service around Internet protocols and standards, but it has not yet begun offering its Internet-based service.
The leading online service provider, America Online Inc., says it brings more users to the Internet via its proprietary service, but it does not have any immediate plans to move its service to the Internet.
And indeed, AOL and other industry pundits, some of whom have predicted the demise of online services because of the growth of the Internet, are seeeing a blurring of distrinctions between online services and the Net.
AOL says it is the Internet and a whole lot more.
Last week, the fourth major entrant in online services, Microsoft Corp., rolled out a hybrid Internet online service as it relaunched the Microsoft Network.
Since its August 1995 rollout, Microsoft has become the third-largest online service, as Prodigy membership has declined. Prodigy says it currently has 1 million households, or about 1.6 million total members. But some analysts dispute these figures, saying it has fewer members.
Prodigy also announced a licensing deal with privately held Progressive Networks to provide Real Audio technology to be integrated with Prodigy Internet. Real Audio software enables users to listen to music and other audio material on the Net.
Prodigy also said that its Africa Online unit is now providing Internet access in Ivory Coast as well as in Kenya.
Prodigy said its Internet service is designed to work with two leading Web browsers, Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer and Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator, but Internet Explorer is its preferred browser through a cross-distribution pact announced last week.
The online service, formerly a joint venture owned by International Business Machines Corp. and Sears Roebuck Corp., is now owned by a group of private investors, including Grupo Carso, a leading Mexican industrial company.
In July, the privately held investor group, called International Wireless, merged with Prodigy. The group's founders, Greg Carr and Delacey, are now at the helm of Prodigy. Carr is chairman of Prodigy Inc.",0
"International Business Machines Corp is discontinuing some unspecified research and development projects as part of a wider effort to cut costs, Louis Gerstner, the company's chairman and chief executive, said on Wednesday.
Gerstner, speaking on a panel of top IBM executives at a Gartner Group technology symposium, said IBM would cut projects for products and services it thought customers would not  want. The move is part of a reallocation of the company's $6.0 billion research budget for 1996, he said.  
""Are the dogs eating the dog food,"" Gerstner asked. ""Is the customer liking this stuff?""
Previously, he said, IBM cut overhead expenses from its research projects. He said that on Monday he sat down with several top IBM executives and painstakingly reviewed the company's entire research and development program.
""We have been able to cut overhead,"" Gerstner said. ""A lot of what has been done in the past was cutting duplication....We are now at the point where we are cutting projects.""  
Gerstner took over IBM in April 1993 and quickly embarked on a massive cost-cutting program.
""We spend $6 billion in research. That just happens to be equal to Microsoft's revenues,"" Gerstner said.
He said the company had moved about 20 percent of the R&D budget to its networked computing research.
In 1995, IBM spent a total of $6.01 billion on research.
Gerstner declined to be more specific about what projects IBM decided to halt. But he stressed that IBM was discontinuing ""projects"" -- not products that IBM's customers depend on. ""I don't want to start any rumors here,"" he said.  
Analysts said Gerstner was likely trying to prevent any possible misinterpretation of his comments and stop any speculation that IBM was cutting research on products already on the market, such as its much-maligned OS/2 Warp operating system.
""Some industry solutions will go away,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial analyst, referring to projects aimed at specific industries, such as travel. He declined to speculate any further on what projects IBM was cutting.
""We used to develop solutions country by country,"" said Nick Donofrio, an IBM senior vice president, who was on the Gartner conference panel.  
When asked why IBM remained in the unprofitable home PC business, executives said the potential of the $60 billion market -- which may grow to $100 billion by 2000 -- was too rich to ignore. A second reason is that IBM is able to leverage its development and manufacturing of corporate PCs, they said.
""We are not doing this just so we can put a box in the home,"" said Robert Stephenson, a senior IBM vice president in charge of the PC business. ""I hope that we will (eventually) have a server in every home.""  
""We can make a profit,"" Stephenson added.
Industry analysts have said the home PC business is the least profitable segment of the market. Indeed, many companies are losing money, they say.",0
"U.S. computer hardware makers are expected to report mixed results for the third quarter starting this week, as some companies are still in the throes of product transitions, but a few will have solid earnings.
Among the large system makers, International Business Machines Corp is expected to have good results, but Digital Equipment Corp is expected to report a loss.
""Product transitions and U.S. strength, those are some issues for the third quarter,"" said Gary Helmig, a SoundView Financial Group analyst.  
Currency will play less of a role than it has in the past two quarters, when it has had a negative impact on earnings, especially at multi-national giants like IBM.
""The negative impact from currency exchange rates is much reduced from June-quarter results,"" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst, referring to large computer systems makers.
Europe is still an issue for some companies, such as Digital, and this quarter will include the sluggish summer month of August, when many Europeans are on vacation.
""They (Digital) have significant exposure to Europe,"" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst.  
Milunovich said that Digital has more exposure in Europe, which has been ""a bit under water,"" than IBM. Digital recently revamped its sales force in Europe and made changes in its distribution channel there, to help sluggish European sales.
Product transitions are still ongoing at some companies, such as Unisys Corp and Silicon Graphics Inc.
IBM has now completed a refresh of most of its hardware products, including its lower-cost mainframe line, the CMOS vesions of its System 390 mainframes and analysts are awaiting results of the first quarter to include any impact from the much-anticipated systems.  
""We expect IBM to highlight the success of its CMOS mainframes,"" Jones of Salomon said.
In the personal computer arena, analysts expect Compaq Computer Corp to again be the leader of the sector, but they do not expect a record quarter for the world's largest PC maker. Its strongest sales are in fourth quarter.
""I think the company had a good quarter and they probably gained market share,"" said Bill Milton of Brown Brothers Harriman, adding that it was a ""so-so quarter"" for the rest of the PC industry. Compaq has the highest profit margins in the industry and Milton said its margins should be up slightly.  
Among the weaker players in PCs, Apple Computer Inc is expected to report a loss, but analysts said they are more focused on the company's comments going forward. The troubled PC maker has previously forecast that it would return to profitability in its second fiscal quarter, ending March.
""Their first order of priority is to eliminate the losses,"" Milton said. ""Can they reach break-even by December or March? Once we get to that point, we will look to see if they can begin to grow their revenues.""
Milton is forecasting Apple's revenues will fall about 17 percent, versus the year ago period.  
The following is a list of consensus earnings estimates for some major U.S. computer makers, as compiled by First Call.

"Home use of the Internet's World Wide Web has more than doubled in the last year, with about 11 percent of U.S. households claiming to have used the Web in the last month, according to a study by PC-Meter.
The market research company said 11 percent of all 98.7 million U.S. households was equivalent to about 11 million homes and was up from 4.4 percent (or 4.3 million) a year ago.
In addition, 13.9 percent of households claimed to have used some type of Internet access service in the last month.
Twenty-five percent of these home Web users now visit shopping sites, PC-Meter's audience rating reports show.
According to PC-Meter's audience rating report, of the cybershoppers, men represented the highest percentage of users. In September, for example, 62.8 percent of Web surfers were men and 37.2 percent were women.
Four basic types of shopping are represented in the top 10 shopping sites; free software downloads, interactive auctions, clubs that sell to members and retail operations.
""These cybershopping statistics suggest that home surfers are increasingly finding value in electronic commerce opportunities offered on the Web,"" Pamela Smith, a vice president of PC-Meter, said in a statement. ""With the holiday season upon us, the greatest growth to date at these sites may well occur during the coming weeks.""
Shareware.com, a software service of online publisher C/NET Inc., was the top consumer shopping site on the Web, PC-Meter said, followed by Columbia House Co., which sells music CDs, computer CD-ROMs, videotapes and laser disks; and ZDNet's Software Library of shareware.
Columbia House and ZD Net were tied for the second most popular consumer shopping site. CUC International Inc., which offers discounts on a wide range of consumer goods and services, is the third most popular site and has the highest percentage of women among the top shopping sites.
Other top shopping sites included Amazon.com, at No. 5, which is a cyber-book store with more than 1 million titles to choose from. Surplus Direct was No. 6, with sales of computer hardware and software.
Coming in as the 10th most popular shopping site was Onsale, an auction site for computer hardware, software and consumer electronics. Onsale also led the category in minutes of usage per month, averaging 41.99 minutes per person per month.
PC-Meter said its results on home Internet use came from an October survey of 9,928 personal computer-owning and non-PC-owning homes. The survey is conducted on a quarterly basis. Its audience rating report is done monthly.
PC-Meter LP is a subsidiary of the NPD Group Inc., a privately held company based in Port Washington, N.Y.",0
"Electronic commerce over the Internet - buying airplane tickets, music CDs, or clothes with a credit card - is not fiction anymore.
But security and other concerns hampered the Internet from becoming an international shopping mall in 1996, and security remains an issue for 1997.
Electronic commerce in 1996 was not quite as robust as some firms had anticipated, as delays in developing the software to secure credit card transactions on the Net kept merchants and consumers at bay. E-commerce is still in its infancy and likely to explode toward the end of the century.
""This was kind of a building year,"" said Scott Smith, a Jupiter Communications analyst. ""Many consumers are just starting to get online, merchants are trying to still figure out how to present themselves online.""
According to Jupiter, total revenues generated from all consumer shopping over the Internet and online services will reach about $1.2 billion in 1996. The revenues are expected to almost double next year, to $2.3 billion.
Jupiter, a New York market research firm, forecasts 1999 revenues to jump to $5.5 billion and to $7.3 billion in 2000.
Travel and the direct distribution of electronic products, such as PCs, software, etc., are the two biggest categories of electronic commerce right now, Smith said, with travel making up about half of the $1.2 billion in 1996 commerce revenues.
Most of the giant retailers are sitting by the sidelines, watching and waiting for the security to be in place and to see what some of the catalog merchants and other more daring retailers are doing on the Internet, where there are many opportunities to save costs, keep inventories low and target customers with specific products aimed at their profiles.
""It's inventing whole new ways of selling stuff,"" said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, the head of International Business Machines Corp.'s Internet division.
IBM has developed a shopping mall called World Avenue, where mostly speciality retailers have storefronts.It also includes Express, the popular unit of Limited Inc.
But still, Internet shopping is not viewed by consumers as completely safe. A recent study by O'Reilly & Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., reported that fewer than 1 percent of all public World Wide Web sites are fully able to host secure transactions.
""It's easy enough to know that if you get a warning from your browser that what you are about to do is dangerous...that this is a deterrant,"" said Richard Peck, a vice president at O'Reilly ""Commerce readiness is an issue of consumer trust, confidence.""
Credit card companies MasterCard International and Visa International have been working together since last February on software to secure credit card transactions, using data encryption (scrambling) techniques and authentication software to ensure identities of the consumer, the merchant and the Web site.
But the software development is behind, analysts and industry executives said, even though the protocols (the roadmap for software developers) called the SET (secure electronic transaction) specification have been published.
The companies had said in February they expected banks to be able to offer secure bankcard services via the Internet to their cardholders in the fourth quarter 1996.
""They have totally blown that deadline out of the water,"" Smith of Jupiter said. ""There was a bit of hype about it originally that made people think it would be done really fast."" Smith said the development has many diverse layers.
""There are issues that have to be sorted out. It probably won't be until 1998 when it is fully implemented,"" Smith said.
Visa did not return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for MasterCard in Purchase, N.Y. said that the companies remain ""on track"" with their original timeframes, but that MasterCard had no news since a recent announcement.
Last month, MasterCard purchased 51 percent of Mondex International Inc., a leading electronic payment system using a payment card called a smart card, which are like electronic wallets. A group of banks and AT&T endorsed the electronic cash card, with pilot testing already going on in some cities.
Smart cards will likely become one of the many ways consumers pay for purchases online. PCs will have built-in smart card readers, specifically designed for online buys.
So while the SET software is still in development, companies are finding other ways to do transactions.
CyberCash, which is also a partner working on the SET transaction system, is providing encryption software for America Online Inc's Web hosting service, so that small or large companies selling goods can have a secure credit card payment system, based on data encryption software currently available.
""SET isn't really all there yet,"" said Doug McKee, manager of Web server development at AOL. ""Cybercash has a system that is like a proprietary version of SET...I don't think there is a reason to wait.""
Some companies are not waiting. While the big retail giants slowly enter cyberspace, a new breed of Internet retailers and brands are being born, like Amazon.com, the popular site bookseller and Onsale.com, an auction house for computers and consumer electronics goods.",0
"International Business Machines Corp reported strong third quarter results on Monday but raised concern about the fourth quarter, sending shares on a roller-coaster ride.
IBM's third quarter earnings of $2.45 a share was just two cents above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.43. IBM opened off, then climbed to 135-3/8 during its analysts' call.
But analysts said comments by its chief financial officer about continuing negative impact from currency, memory prices and higher expenses dampened his otherwise bullish outlook.  
""There were some cautionary comments about fourth quarter,"" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst, adding that he was revising his fourth quarter estimates.
Some analysts started cutting fourth quarter numbers after the conference call, reflecting the company's comments about a bigger currency impact, continued drop in memory chip prices and higher-than-expected fourth quarter restructuring costs.
In general, analysts said they were pleased with IBM's ongoing cost-cutting, its successful transition to new products in all its hardware areas and its investments in its future growth. Revenue growth was also better than expected.  
""I think the most impressive was the revenue growth,"" said Stephen Dube, a Wasserstein Perrella analyst. ""It's coming from all other products except for mainframes."" As expected, IBM said its mainframe revenues fell in the quarter.
Previously, IBM had expected that currency and memory chip prices would have a diminished impact on the second half.
But Monday, IBM said it could have a slightly bigger negative impact from currency rates than the $0.08 a share it saw in the third quarter and memory prices would continue to hurt its semiconductor business, comments that had a dampening effect on analysts hoping for a very strong fourth quarter.  
Analysts still expect IBM to report a strong fourth quarter, because many other products are doing well and it will also begin to see sales of its recently shipped models of its lower-cost mainframes. But they also need to account for IBM's comments that it will begin spreading out some of its mainframes sales over several quarters.
G. Richard Thoman, IBM's chief financial officer, told Wall Street that a ""growing proportion"" of IBM's mainframes sales are going through its computer services business, and therefore, IBM will not see the full sales in a quarter for all its machines.  
""If you sell a mainframe for $100,000 and you lease it or it's on a services contract ... rather than $100,000 at once, you have $8,000 a quarter,"" Thoman said in an interview, adding that this is ""just an example.""
Thoman buoyed analysts with news that IBM's mainframe installations, which grew 25 perent, are growing ""almost back to 1980s"" levels. But even with such strong customer interest, IBM's prices are still so low that revenues are still expected to decline, while mainframe profits are forecast to be hefty.
""This quarter it did not come from mainframes,"" said Stephen Dube, a Wasserstein Perella Securities analyst.
""Mainframes are not a growth area for them,"" he said. But mainframes are still IBM's second most profitable hardware product, after its AS/400 minicomputers.
The fourth quarter was also marred by a prediction that IBM will take a bigger-than-expected restructuring cost. Originally, IBM had predicted about $200 million per quarter this year, but said on Monday that it will spend an additional $100 million to $200 million in the fourth quarter.
IBM said the increase resulted from more employees taking its voluntary buyout plan in Europe in the fourth quarter.",0
"Many personal computer makers this week will roll out flashy multimedia PCs designed around a new chip by Intel Corp. -- a development that is expected to give the consumer sector of the industry a much-needed boost.
Intel will officially launch its much-anticipated P55C microprocessor using its so-called MMX (multimedia extension) technology Wednesday and a slew of companies will unveil new consumer PCs, notebooks and desktops using the new chip, which will offer much faster performance.
The company said the new chip will offer more than just faster speeds on the new PCs, but a spokesman declined to give any further details.
""Instead of just raw performance ... you get a richer experience,"" said an Intel spokesman in Santa Clara, Calif.
International Business Machines Corp., Compaq Computer Corp., Dell Computer Corp., Gateway 2000 Inc., Toshiba America Corp., Sony Corp. and many other firms are expected to unveil new high-end PCs simultaneously with Intel's announcment.
Most machines are expected to be priced over $3,000.
Intel said that an MMX-based PC would be more like a television, with sharper images, three-dimensional graphics, faster audio and television-like video. Other benefits include faster video teleconferencing and Internet access.
""As more and more people use PCs, the expectations are higher and higher, from what they see in movies and television,"" the Intel spokesman said.
""This moves the PC platform a little further along to media-rich applications. Our goal is to surpass the TV in terms of audio and video.""
For example, he said, a user playing a video game on an MMX-based PC will feel as if he or she is in a video arcade.
""It's a tremendous kickoff to 1997,"" said Rod Schrock, a vice president of Compaq's Presario division.
""We are so excited about the new MMX processor that we redesigned the entire line of Presarios from the ground up. Customers are going to get a pretty dazzling experience.""
Schrock declined to give any product specifics, but he said that Compaq will launch its new Presario consumer PCs with MMX in the same timeframe as Intel's announcement.
""It should provide an added boost to the demand for the new generation of PCs,"" Schrock added. ""There was no major industry event in 1996, this year you have a new processor.""",0
"U.S. computer makers are expected to report solid fourth quarter earnings in what is normally the strongest quarter of the year, but the stronger dollar will have a negative impact on some big systems makers.
And despite all the negative reports from computer retailers about lackluster personal computer sales, analysts said most U.S. PC makers -- with the exception of Apple Computer Inc and AST Research Inc -- will show strong sales growth, fueled by hefty corporate PC buying.
Apple is first to report, with Q1 late Wednesday.  
Earlier this month, Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple Computer forecast it would report an operating loss for its first quarter, ending December, citing weak U.S. demand for its Performa consumer PC and continued shortages of notebooks.
""Most of the indications are that business throughout the (PC) sector, other than Apple, was strong,"" said Eugene Glazer, a Dean Witter analyst. ""With all the negative comments you are hearing from retailers, some of that market was going to the direct marketers (like Dell Computer Corp and Gateway 2000 Inc ).""  
Analysts said PC leader Compaq Computer Corp is likely to report strong earnings, especially after semiconductor giant Intel Corp reported a blow-out fourth quarter, surpassing Wall Street's highest estimates.
Compaq gets about 20 percent or so of its revenues from the retail consumer channel and the rest of its revenues are from sales to corporate customers, which were booming.
""The consumer business didn't hurt them,"" said Jim Poyner, an Oppenheimer & Co analyst. ""Dell and Compaq are benefitting from the same forces, the transition to the PentiumPro (chip), a hot notebook market and progress in the server business.""  
On the larger systems side, companies like International Business Machines Corp, Digital Equipment Corp, Unisys Corp, are expected to see some negative impact from a stronger dollar overseas, plus sluggish sales in Europe, while business in the U.S. remains strong.
""Business is quite good in the U.S.,"" said Jay Stevens, a Dean Witter analyst. ""Where it's slower, or where the concerns have been expressed is overseas, mostly in Europe.""
Digital is expected to report a slight profit, as it slowly recovers from sales force problems in Europe and a money-losing PC business. PCs are expected to break-even.  
""I think it will be a good quarter,"" said Steve Milunovich, a Morgan Stanley analyst. ""The dollar did strengthen at the end of the quarter. You will generally see numbers near consensus.""
Analysts said they expect IBM's earnings to be a bit better than expected, but that its expenses for headcount reductions will be greater than the previous quarters.
""Europe remains a slower grower, which has led to a number of organizational and planned efficiency changes,"" said John Jones, a Salomon Brothers analyst. IBM reports after the stock market closes next Tuesday, changing an old tradition.  
The following estimates for some major computer makers are compiled by First Call, a unit of Thomson Financial Networks.

"A top executive at Compaq Computer Corp. said Thursday he was leaving the world's biggest personal computer maker and joining an Internet startup, giving credibility to the startup and setting in motion a realignment of Compaq's sales managers.
The executive, Ross Cooley, is leaving a position where he was in charge of Compaq's $7 billion North American computer business for a job at a four-month-old company with the high-tech name of pcOrder.com
At pcOrder.com, Cooley, 55, will fill the as-yet unfilled positions of chairman and chief executive officer and have a salary of $1 a year, plus stock options.
His move from an executive suite at a Fortune 500 company to a technology startup mirrors that of several other executives over the past few years, notably, the departure of Alex Mandl from AT&T earlier this year.
Cooley's move provides instant credibility to pcOrder.com, which provides a marketplace on the Internet for buying and selling personal computers and related equipment.
Cooley's retirement had been rumored in the industry for several months, and Compaq announced that James Schraith, formerly president of The Cerplex Group Inc. and president of AST Research Inc., is replacing Cooley.
""Ross's plan to retire has been in discussion for awhile and there were some rumors flying,"" Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and CEO of Compaq, said in an interview. ""The time has come and obviously as you can see the succession is already in place ... Ross has been a great leader.""
At the same time, Compaq created a new sales infrastructure, hiring Richard Snyder, a Dell Computer Corp. executive, for a newly-created position of general manager, worldwide sales. All the heads of Compaq's five geographical sales regions -- Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Japan, Latin America and North America -- will report to him.
Previously, these regions all reported directly to Pfeiffer. But as Compaq has quickly grown to an almost $18 billion company in recent years, Pfeiffer said he needs another executive to stay in touch with the day-to-day activities of its worldwide sales and support organization.
""Fifteen people have been reporting to me up until this morning when we announced this change,"" Pfeiffer said. ""That is a huge top management organization. As the company grows, my tasks change.""
Compaq has grown from its origins as one of the first companies to successfully clone the IBM PC in the early 1980s to become the leading PC maker in the world. Cooley is known for his strong relationships with the PC sales channel and his role in building Compaq's massive distribution.
""My feelings in joining pcOrder are similar to those I had in joining Compaq almost 13 years ago,"" Cooley said in a statement. ""Back then, I saw the irrefutable logic of the PC as a new paradigm in computing. Today, I believe pcOrder's technology and vision represent an irrefutable value proposition.""
Before joining Compaq in 1984, Cooley held several sales and marketing positions at International Business Machines Corp., where he worked for 18 years.
""Getting Cooley is really a coup for pcOrder,"" said John McCarthy, a Forrester Research analyst, adding that Cooley's connections in PC distrubution will give pcOrder more credibility as it builds its system. Cooley's acceptance of $1 a year for salary, plus stock options, is also a ""big bet on the company's upside (potential),"" McCarthy said.
pcOrder for now is still private, but the company is contemplating a public offering eventually.
""We do not have a set plan or a set timetable, but we are seriously considering it,"" said founder and President Christina Jones. Jones will continue as president of pcOrder. The post of chairman and CEO had been vacant since the start-up was founded in June.
pcOrder.com is a marketplace on the Internet, where PC makers, components makers and distributors list information and receive orders.
Currently, sales representatives and customers user pcOrder to configure build-to-order PCs, compare prices, and place orders over the Internet. The system contains information on over 150,000 products in the PC industry from over 800 manufacturers.",0
"America Online Inc, the world's largest online service, said with the changes it implemented earlier this fall and its major restructuring announced this week, it is seeing a renewed momentum.
Steve Case, AOL chairman and CEO, told the company's annual meeting that with the reoganization of AOL, its new flat-rate pricing, and its big accounting changes, ""the pieces are now in place"" for growth, not only in new subscribers, but with major new sources of revenue, such as advertising.  
""Now we have a new structure in place...and the momentum is stronger than ever,"" Case told shareholders, adding that in the month of October alone, AOL added 250,000 new subscribers, a sign of its ""renewed momentum.""
The company, which has seen its stock decline, has been under pressure from the lower-cost Internet access services and has seen its subscriber growth slow this summer.  
AOL, based in Dulles, Va., was further pressured when Microsoft Corp relaunched the Microsoft Network this month at a flat price of $19.95 for unlimited access, on par with most direct Internet access services.
Previously, AOL had added a 20/20 pricing plan to combat the growing competition, with 20 hours for $19.95 a month, in addition to its $9.95 for 10 hours plan.  But on Monday, it succumbed with its own flat rate $19.95 a month, and it will discontinue its direct Internet access, called GNN.  
Case and other AOL executives highlighted to shareholders how the company will see new sources of revenue from advertising and merchandising and how one area of its new business will be running on a cable industry model, with more revenues from advertising than subscriber fees.
""Increasingly, we are evolving where we depend less on subscriber revenue and increasingly on advertising and other sources,"" said Lennert Leader, the company's chief financial officer.  
One of the areas from which the company expects this growth to come is its new unit AOL Networks, headed by former MTV executive Bob Pittman, to oversee AOL's flagship online service.  The other two units in AOL's reorganization are its AOL Studios, to create content for its service and ANS Communications, to manage the core network infrastructure.
Pittman said he expects that in the future, over 50 percent of AOL's revenues will come from advertising and other revenue sources, such as merchandising the AOL brand name, through books, television, etc.  
""To me, it looks very similar to the cable network business,"" Pittman said, adding that in the early days of Viacom Inc's MTV network, subscriber revenue was greater than advertising revenue.  ""Our growth curve looks very similar to the cable business.  Ad revenue is growing faster than subsciber revenues.""
Pittman said he plans to ""ride the tremendous wave"" of AOL's brand recognition for new sources of revenue growth, for which he said there are multi-levels of possibilities. One area, he mentioned after his second day on the job, is the catalog business, which can move to electronic shopping.  
Shareholders, some of whom said the stock has been a very good investment because of its many stock splits, said they were pleased with AOL's recent actions, in particular the measure to restructure accounting methods.
""The fact that they are getting a more straightforward accounting system is a step in the right direction,"" said David Ryan, a retired shareholder from the Washington, D.C. area. ""Their financial statements were hard to understand. It's more straightforward now.""  Ryan said the stock has split three times since he has owned it in the past four or five years.  
AOL said on Monday that it will now expense all its marketing costs, which includes the hefty subscriber acquisition costs, as they are incurred, instead of deferring those costs over time.
To reflect those immediate changes, AOL is taking a $385 million restructuring charge in the September quarter, to account for the balance of its deferred subscriber acquisition costs.  AOL CFO Leader also told the meeting that the cost to acquire new subscribers will be lower in the future, as AOL depends less on sending out floppy disks, and as AOL comes with more new PCs.
""The good news is the growth is accelerating,"" Case said. ""We have taken the step of expensing the marketing and we can avoid some of the debates about the earnings.""",0
"The director-general of the BBC called on Friday for an increase in the British television licence fee to protect what he said was ""the most successful cultural institution in the world"".
Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, John Birt said the fee -- payable by all television set owners -- had fallen in real terms over the past decade and described the recent financial history of the BBC as ""miraculous"".
He said an increase was needed to help fund new services as digital technology multiplies the number of channels available.
""The BBC is the most successful cultural institution in the world, one of the great inventions of the 20th century. But it can no longer be taken for granted,"" Birt said.
""If it (the BBC) is to innovate with high-quality services in the new technologies as it has done again and again ... then at some point in the future -- and for the first time since 1985 -- we shall need a real increase in the licence fee.""
A colour television licence costs 89.50 pounds ($139.10) annually. Licence income totals around 1.8 billion pounds each year -- 95 percent of BBC income. The money funds the BBC's five national radio stations as well as its two television channels.
Sources at the BBC said it wanted a modest rise in ""low single (percentage) figures over time"". The BBC will shortly begin talks with the government to review the licence fee -- currently pegged to inflation.
Any price increase would take effect from April 1, 1997. A general election is due in Britain by next May and the government might be reluctant to saddle viewers with a higher licence fee shortly before it went to the polls.
Birt said the BBC was now towards the bottom of the European licence fee league table. He added that a top-rate subscription to satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the dominant force in British pay television, costs 300 pounds annually.
The BBC says it has achieved cost savings of 100 million pounds in each of the past three years and aims to build on its commercial success as Europe's biggest broadcasting exporter.
But Birt said more licence money was vital.
Digital technology -- which will allow the creation of hundreds of new channels and interactive services such as home shopping -- is set to reach Britain next year.
BSkyB is planning to launch digital satellite services in late 1997 and a terrestrial version is expected to follow within a further 12 months.
The BBC is planning to offer licence-fee payers supplementary programming and a 24-hour news service as it moves into the digital era.
""It (digital) will mean upholding our national role -- and opening new doors wherever we can for licence fee payers,"" Birt added.",0
"Shares in EMI Plc, one of the world's five music majors, climbed on Tuesday after the company said that long-term prospects for the stuttering global music market were positive.
EMI, which demerged from rentals company Thorn Plc three months ago, said profit before tax and exceptional items rose 9.4 percent to 112.5 million pounds ($188.4 million) in the six months to September 30. Net interim dividend per share increased by 12.7 percent to eight pence.
EMI shares, under pressure in recent weeks on fears that music sales were faltering after a decade of strong growth, added 15p to 1,286p in a generally lower market.
""These are excellent interim results from the EMI Group,"" chairman Sir Colin Southgate said in a statement.
""They have been achieved against a background of variable growth in the major markets and mixed results from our competitors,"" he added. ""The increase in the interim dividend reflects our confidence in the long-term health of the music industry and EMI's position within it.""
Finance Director Simon Duffy said EMI remained confident that the global music business would continue to grow by some 6-8 percent annually in the medium to long-term.
""This year is looking a little bit below that level,"" said Duffy, saying that markets were patchy but that overall first half industry growth had been 5.5 percent. However, he added that the impact was diluted by the strength of sterling.
The market's sluggishness has recently been reflected by 100 layoffs at various labels within Warner Music and 400 job cuts at PolyGram NV -- another of the top five in the world music business.
EMI said that sales in the United States were almost flat and declined slightly in France. But this was offset by improvements in Japan, Britain and Germany while Southeast Asia and Latin America boasted particularly large gains.
Turnover from the EMI Music division was down marginally at around 1.1 billion pounds but improved margins helped to boost operating profits to 131.9 million pounds from 124.6 million.
The HMV division, grouping record and book stores chains, had an operating loss of 11 million pounds which the company said was in line with expectations as its international expansion continued.",0
"Granada Group, which won control of leading British hotelier Forte 10 months ago, on Wednesday reaped the fruits of its victory when it posted a 37 percent rise in annual profits to 480 million pounds ($806 million).
Media and leisure group Granada said that it was on target to keep a promise made in the heat of the takeover battle by boosting profits at Forte by over 100 million pounds per annum from the current year.
It said it had already achieved some 40 million pounds in profit improvements at Forte. Such rapid progress lifted the pre-tax, pre-exceptional profits to that 480 million pound figure, topping most share analysts' expectations.
Turnover in the year to end-September grew by 60 percent to 3.82 billion pounds as Granada grafted on Forte's hotel and roadside restaurant businesses.
Total dividend was raised by 11 percent to 13p per share.
""The key has been the speed with which we have been able to move on the Forte businesses,"" said chairman Gerry Robinson.
Granada took over family-controlled Forte in a 3.9 billion pound deal earlier this year after a bitter bid battle that raged over the Christmas and New Year period 12 months ago.
Analysts were surprised at the lacklustre reaction to Granada's strong results and an upbeat statement in which it said that trading had been encouraging in the first few weeks of its new financial year.
The shares, which had gained in recent days in anticipation of bumper results, slipped 7 1/2p to 885p by mid-afternoon in a generally gloomy market.
""Granada is a cheap stock on fundamentals and is backed by good management,"" said Greg Feehely of Kleinwort Benson.
Granada, which runs two British commercial television stations and a chain of high street rental stores, continues to reorganise following its acqusition of Forte.
It hopes to complete the sale of a group of top international hotels and the disposal of the Welcome Break chain of British motorway service areas in early 1997.
Analysts expect the hotels to raise a total of around 900 million pounds and the service areas a further 350-400 million pounds. That would help cut net debt from 3.5 billion pounds.
Granada sold the first of the 17 Exclusive hotels on Tuesday when Hong Kong based Mandarin Oriental International Ltd bought London's Hyde Park Hotel for 86 million pounds.
But Robinson said Granada planned to retain its 10.8 percent stake Granada holds in pay television operator British Sky Broadcasting. That investment is worth over one billion pounds.
The largest contribution came from the Restaurants division, which boosted profit before interest and tax by 80 percent to 217 million pounds on turnover which rose over 60 percent to 1.7 billion pounds.",0
"English football champions Manchester United extended their outstanding recent stock market form on Monday as renewed bid speculation sent the share price soaring by over 10 percent for the second straight session.
The latest gains were by a weekend report in the Sunday Express that American Mark McCormack's IMG marketing agency was considering a bid for United.
""We never make comments on unsubstantiated press stories,"" said an official at IMG's London office. But he said that IMG, most active in sports such as tennis and golf, was interested in increasing its involvement in football.
Earlier this year IMG lost out to sportwear company Adidas in a battle for control of former French football champions Olympique Marseille.
The Express report said that any credible bid for United would have to be pitched at around 650-700 pence per share, valuing the club at around 430 million pounds ($678 million).
United shares rocketed again on Monday, rising 54.5p to 568p, valuing the club at around 350 million pounds.
The share price has virtually trebled since the start of the year and added almost 25 percent in the last two sessions alone.
The latest winning run was triggered when chief executive Martin Edwards said last week that United's status as Britain's most profitable soccer club made it a likely bid target.
Publishing group VCI is reported to have made a 300 million pound bid for United earlier this year which was rejected.
Analysts say that United would be an attractive target for media companies, citing the U.S example of television mogul Ted Turner who owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team.
The potential income from pay-per-view television deals is also helping to drive the share price and may make United's main shareholders think twice about selling now.
""The directors own 22 percent of the club...They can sit back for five years and enjoy the football and then enjoy the benefits when the really big money comes in from pay-per-view,"" said Vinay Bedi of brokerage Wise Speke.
Pay-per-view is expected to be introduced by the end of the century and could allow leading clubs such as United to earn tens of millions of pounds annually from television.
Focus on such juicy future pickings also lifted shares in Tottenham Hotspur, the other Premier League club with a full London Stock Exchange listing. They added 11p to 461p.
United, who last season won the coveted English league and F.A. Cup double, had television income of 5.7 million pounds in 1995-96 when the club made a profit of 15.4 million before tax.",0
"Britain's Granada Group, which won control of hotel and catering empire Forte in January, on Wednesday reported a 37 percent surge in full-year profits to 480 million pounds ($804 million).
The media and leisure group said that it would deliver on its promise to improve profits at Forte by over 100 million pounds per annum from 1996/97.
Granada chairman Gerry Robinson called the results ""very satisfying"". ""The key has been the speed with which we have been able to move on the Forte businesses,"" he told Reuters.
Granada took over family-controlled Forte in a 3.9 billion pound deal earlier this year after a bitter bid battle that raged over the Christmas and New Year period 12 months ago.
The company said that Forte had responded well to its management and that it had already improved profitability there by approaching 40 million pounds.
Granada continues to reorganise following the acquisition of Britain's leading hotel group. Robinson said there was substantial interest from a wide range of potential purchasers of the luxury hotels it has put on the market.
Granada sold the first of the 17 Exclusive hotels on Tuesday when Hong Kong based Mandarin Oriental International Ltd bought London's Hyde Park Hotel for 86 million pounds.
Robinson said that Granada expected to complete the disposals by early 1997. Analysts calculate the sale of assets including the George V in Paris and Plaza Athenee in New York will raise a total of around 900 million pounds.
The Granada chairman said that the company hoped to sell the Welcome Break chain of British motorway service areas in January or February of next year. The 21 sites were acquired in the Forte deal but must be sold off because of monopoly concerns.
But he said there were no plans to sell the 10.8 percent stake Granada holds in pay television operator British Sky Broadcasting.
Group turnover in the year to end-September climbed 60 percent to 3.82 billion pounds. Total dividend was raised by 11 percent to 13p per share.
Granada shares, which had risen in recent days in anticipation of bumper results, fell by 8p to 884 1/2p in a generally gloomy market.
The largest contribution came from the Restaurants division, which boosted profit before interest and tax by 80 percent to 217 million pounds as the Forte acquisition bore fruit.
The new Hotels unit contributed 168 million while Media, including Granada's two British commercial television stations, made 163 million, up 17 percent. Profits from the high street rentals arm was marginally higher at 126 million.",0
"Shares in Premier Farnell dipped on Monday after the newly enlarged electronic components distributor posted half-year profits slightly below expectations.
Premier Farnell was created in April when Britain's Farnell Electronics completed a $2.8 billion takeover of America's Premier Industrial Corp -- a company twice its size.
Pre-tax profit for the six months to July 28 totalled 56.1 million pounds ($88.4 million). That was down on the pre-tax figure of 71.3 million pounds a year earlier but that had been flattered by a large one-off gain.
More pertinently, analysts had forecast profit in a range of 57.5 to 61.6 million pounds and the failure to reach that level was reflected in a 10.5p decline in the share price to 670p.
The company said that the market for electronic components has shown much lower levels of growth in 1996 than in recent years and added it did not expect any major change in conditions for the rest of the year.
""I think the evidence is we've bottomed the cycle and the signs at the moment are positive. But we are planning on a more conservative basis at this moment in time,"" chief executive Howard Poulson told Reuters.
Premier said its priorities were the development and international expansion of the catalogue business and further exploitation of synergies between its transatlantic operations.
Poulson said he was delighted with progress on integration following an acquisition which had transformed the company, based in the northern English town of Wetherby, into the third largest electronic components distributor in the world.
""The integration is going superbly..I am very pleased with what people have done on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said.
He said he did not see any further scope for cutting costs following the acquisition.
""I think we've finished with all of the cost-cutting. This was never a deal which was built on reducing overheads and getting rid of people,"" he said.
""We said we would remove duplication in our two head offices -- we've done that, we've probably dropped about 150 people since we made the acquisition."" The company now has some 6,500 staff, 4,000 of whom are in the United States.
""What the business is about now is building sales and building our profits that way,"" he added.
Premier Farnell said its sales expansion projects were on schedule and should begin to make a contribution in the fourth quarter of the year. REUTER",0
"Wembley, England's home of soccer since the 1920s, will be the site of a new national stadium, the country's Sports Council announced on Tuesday.
The government-backed Council selected the north London venue ahead of the northern city of Manchester as the preferred location. Some 120 million pounds ($200 million) in National Lottery funding will be supplied to help turn the famous old stadium into a world class sports facility for the 21st century.
Wembley and Manchester were selected as the two leading candidates from five applicants last year. Sports Council chairman Sir Rodney Walker said that Wembley won out as it had greater potential to attract major international events.
The Sports Council has supported the English Football Association's bid to host soccer's World Cup in 2006 and the British Athletics Federation's attempts to attract the world championships in 2001.
But Manchester did not lose out completely as the Sports Council announced it had agreed in principle to provide up to 60 million pounds towards a new Stadium of the North to be used to host the Commonwealth Games in 2002, which have already been awarded to the city.
It said it would also consider backing Manchester council's bid for 20 million pound in funding for a new swimming and diving complex in the city, another Games facility.
""The Sports Council has agreed a 200 million package of financial support which will provide further opportunities for English and British sport to develop as a leading competitor on the world stage,"" Walker said.
A competition is to be held to select an architectural firm to design the English National Stadium at the site owned by Wembley Plc.
Architect Sir Norman Foster has already unveiled his radical plans for an 80,000-seater stadium.
In his design, Wembley's famous twin towers would be repositioned to form a new gateway to the stadium area. The stadium would also be spun round 90 degrees with a new North/South axis.",0
"Britain's commercial television watchdog on Thursday invited applications to run terrestrial frequencies which will multiply the number of channels available to viewers in the new digital age.
""This is a very important day for UK viewers...as many as 35 or 36 channels could be available on digital terrestrial television,"" said Peter Rogers, chief executive of the Independent Television Commission (ITC).
The ITC is seeking applications to operate four ""multiplexes"", as the blocks of frequencies are known. Each block can carry as many as six digital channels.
The BBC has already been earmarked its own multiplex, and commercial networks ITV and Channel 4 will share one.
The ITC will award the 12-year licences on critieria including speed of roll-out of the service and the appeal of programming but a cash bid will not be required. Licences are expected to be awarded next spring and broadcasting could begin by mid-1998.
Britain is leading the way in the development of digital terrestrial but some observers question whether it will succeed.
Pay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the largest shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service into Britain in late 1997 -- several months ahead of the terrestrial version.
The satellite version could offer several hundred channels and BSkyB's control of key movie and sporting rights are likely to make it an attractive proposition.
The ITC's Rogers told a news conference he was confident the terrestrial option would prove attractive to investors.
""I would be surprised and disappointed if we didn't have applications for all of the multiplexes,"" he said.
His view was shared by Paul Styles, a media expert at consultancy and accounting firm KPMG.
""Most people perceive digital bandwith to be valuable so I think there will be interest in the multiplexes,"" he said.
""This will not be an overnight sensation but a business to be built,"" he said, identifying ITV companies, cable groups and BSkyB itself as potential licence applicants.
Digital technology increases the number of channels which can be transmitted and enhances sound and picture quality. it also enables interactive services such as home shopping and home banking to be created.
Digital means converting sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones -- rather than transmitting them as electric signals as now happens. A set-top box or ""decoder"" will be required to receive digital services.
This is also a source of controversy, as ITC officials admit that there is no current UK or European legislation to enforce a common standard for decoders.
That means that consumers could theoretically have to pay several hundred pounds (dollars) for a set-top box to receive BSkyB's digital services and then have to buy a second box a few months later to receive digital terrestrial.
British Labour Euro MP Carole Tongue on Thursday wrote to European Commissioner Martin Bangemann to demand that all set-top boxes provide a common interface for all broadcasters.",0
"British-based exhibitions group Blenheim is seen as an ideal fit with rumoured suitor United News & Media, share analysts said on Monday.
United News & Media and Anglo-Dutch group Reed Elsevier have long been seen as rivals for the hand of Blenheim. However, industry sources said Reed was thought to be out of the running.
""Blenheim's strength in Europe and France in particular mean it would be a good fit (for United),"" said one analyst. ""The exhibitions business is also doing quite well at this stage in the cycle.""
Dutch publisher VNU stirred the waters last week when it paid 500 pence a share to take a 15 percent stake in Blenheim. VNU declined comment on reports on Monday that it was set to increase its stake to 25 percent.
It said last week its 15 percent holding in Blenheim was a strategic long-term investment and said it had no intention of making an offer for the whole company unless rival offers emerged.
Its move is certain to have concentrated the mind of United News chief executive Clive Hollick, who is now reported to be weighing a bid of up to 520p per share, valuing Blenheim at some 480 million pounds ($757 million).
Blenheim shares closed 6 1/2p lower at 477 1/2p on Monday.
United News has so far refused to declare its hand. Analysts said a complicating factor was the continuing reorganisation of its businesses following its merger earlier this year with television and financial services group MAI. United News also publishes two British national newspapers.
""A bid makes a lot of sense but the timing is not good for United News,"" said media analyst Nick Ward of Credit Lyonnais Laing.
Blenheim, in which French utilities company Generale des Eaux has a 15 percent stake, posted pre-tax profits of 35.6 million pounds in 1995 on turnover of 202.5 million.
France was its largest source of revenue, accounting for 37 percent of earnings, followed by 26 percent from the U.S., 20 percent from Britain, 11 percent from Germany and six percent from the rest of the world.
Miller Freeman is the business magazines and exhibitions arm of United News. It operates in the U.S., Europe and Asia but analysts regard the American market as its main strength.
Analyst Anthony de Larrinaga of Panmure Gordon said a bid of around five pounds per share would represent an attractive deal for investors in both United and Blenheim.",0
"Britons will shortly learn how much they will be asked to pay to help fund the expansion of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio and television services in the multi-channel future.
The BBC has been lobbying the government to grant it an above-inflation increase in the annual licence fee, arguing that more money is needed if it is to remain at the forefront of broadcasting into the next millennium. The government is expected to announce its decision by early to mid-December.
The BBC, which calls itself ""the world's most successful cultural institution"", derives 95 percent of its funding from the annual fee payable by all television set owners.
The fee stands at 89.50 pounds ($150) and provided income of 1.8 billion pounds in the last financial year -- far outweighing the 77 million pound net benefit from the BBC's expanding commercial arm. The licence is guaranteed as a source of BBC funding for the next five years.
BBC Director-General John Birt launched his campaign for what he said would be the first real increase in the licence fee in over a decade at a conference in Edinburgh in August.
""If the BBC is to sustain the existing level of services; if it is to remain as creative and dynamic an institution in the 21st as it has been in the 20th century; if it is to innovate with high quality services in the new technologies...we shall need a real increse in the level of the licence fee,"" he said.
""Neither a new leap forward in efficiency, nor a vigorous drive to increase our commercial revenue will be enough.""
The BBC is believed to be seeking a rise of around five pounds -- which would generate extra revenue of more than 100 million pounds. Annual inflation is currently 2.7 percent.
Birt's call has received a cool reponse from the ruling Conservatives and opposition Labour, wary of pinning a price rise on more than 20 million households in the run-up to a general election. The new rate would take effect in April while the election must be held by the following month.
Recent newspaper reports said that National Heritage Secretary Virginia Bottomley has settled for a five-year formula that would leave the licence fee unchanged in real terms.
The reports said that Bottomley would offer higher rises in the second and third years to help fund new digital services and commercial projects but that increases in the following two years would be pegged below inflation.
The BBC, which runs two television channels and five national radio stations and has an enviable reputation as a quality public service broadcaster, has stepped up its campaign.
""You want us to do things. We want to do them. Now please give us the means and we can get on with the job,"" Will Wyatt, chief executive of the BBC Broadcast division said in a recent speech.
""We have called for only a modest increase, but one which would enable us to achieve a disproportionate amount of good.""
The BBC points out that it has cut its cost base by almost 20 percent over the past three years and increased programme investment by 300 million pounds.
The licence fee debate comes as the broadcasting industry is set to be revolutionised by the move to digital transmission.
Digital technology converts sound and pictures into binary digits -- a series of noughts and ones. It increases picture quality, multiplies the number of channels that can be broadcast and allows for the creation of interactive services.
Pay television operator BSkyB, in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp is the leading shareholder, plans to launch a digital satellite service with some 200 channels into Britain from next year.
BSkyB, one of the corporate success stories of the 1990s, is Britain's leading pay television operator with more than five million subscribers. Its top package of premium films and live sports events costs subscribers 324 pounds per annum.
A terrestrial digital service, broadcast from land-based transmitters and offering some 36 channels, is expected to begin by mid-1998.
The BBC plans to use digital technology to offer all licence payers supplementary programming to its core BBC1 and BBC2 output plus a 24-hour news service. It plans to make them available via satellite and terrestrial distribution.
The BBC expects to retain a share of around a third of all viewing and listening in 2005, down from 45 percent as the number of channels multiplies and the market fragments.
The digital expansion creates fresh opportunities for the corporation to develop its BBC Worldwide commercial arm.
Worldwide is in negotiations with partners in Britain and the United States over the creation of a number of subscription channels, exploiting its strengths in areas such as comedy, drama and natural history.
Its partner in Britain is Flextech Plc, while it is working with Discovery Communications Inc on channels for international markets. Leading U.S. cable television operator Tele-Communications Inc is a major shareholder in both companies. It aims to launch its UK services in mid 1997.
Some media figures doubt the sustainability of the licence fee as subscription and pay-per-view services proliferate.
David Elstein, chief executive of Britain's new Channel 5 commercial television network, said recently that he believed that pay-per-view would eventually ""consign the licence fee to history, where it belongs"".",0
"British National Lottery operator Camelot  LOTT.CN on Tuesday posted lower interim profits as income from scratchcard sales fell by over 450 million pounds ($750 million).
Camelot chief executive Tim Holley also told Reuters that the planned second weekly National Lottery draw would be launched on February 5 and be held every Wednesday thereafter. Camelot, which has faced a storm of criticism over its jackpot earnings since the lottery was launched two years ago, reported pre-tax profits of 31.5 million pounds on sales of 2.1 billion pounds for the 24 weeks to September 14.
This compares with pre-tax profit of 36.2 million pounds and sales of 2.51 billion pounds in the same period a year ago.
Camelot's five shareholding companies -- Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, GTech UK, Racal Electronics and ICL shared a total dividend payount of 10 million pounds, up from 9.5 million.
Sales for the weekly National Lottery game rose two percent to 1.68 billion pounds. Two thirds of the adult population regularly buy tickets for the Saturday draw, an event which is televised live and has become a ritual for many Britons.
But sales of Camelot's ""Instants"" scratchcards fell from 871 million pounds last year to 419 million this time.
Camelot executives said that the decline in scratchcard sales was to be expected as the initial enthusiasm generated by their introduction in March 1995 waned.
""Mirroring the experience of lotteries worldwide, sales of Instants have fallen since their launch and are now settled at around 17 million pounds per week,"" Chairman Sir George Russell said in a statement.
Chief executive Holley said that the second weekly draw should boost sales of National Lottery game tickets by 15-20 percent from their current weekly average of 69 million.
Camelot said that over one billion pounds -- 50 percent of turnover -- had been handed out in prize money in the first half and that 567 million pounds had gone to ""Good Causes"" -- including charities and projects in sports and the arts.
Camelot, which has been granted a seven-year licence, said that over 40 percent of turnover went to ""Good Causes"" and the governnment in duties, making it the world's most efficient lottery operator.
Profit after tax is just under one percent of total sales and Holley dismissed criticisms of Camelot's performance.
""I think we have a slight problem in this country with success,"" he said, adding that foreign lottery companies were bemused by the atacks on Camelot.
The group confirmed plans to set up The Camelot Foundation to support organisations helping the disadvantaged and disabled.",0
"Britain's Ladbroke Group and the U.S. Hilton Hotels Corp (HHC) on Thursday unveiled an alliance to reunite the famous Hilton hotel brand around the world for the first time since 1964.
""We have been separated but now our companies are engaged,"" said Steve Bollenbach, HHC's chief executive officer.
""This will make Hilton the force to be reckoned with in the global hotel industry,"" Bollenbach told a news conference. ""It will eliminate customer confusion and benefit millions of our customers worldwide.""
HHC owns the Hilton name in the United States while Ladbroke holds the rights everywhere else through its Hilton International (HIC) subsidiary.
The two companies have signed an outline agreement to unify the Hilton brand, separated in 1964 when HIC was spun off from the American operation. Ladbroke acquired HIC in 1987.
In the alliance grouping 400 hotels in 49 countries, HHC and HIC intend to cooperate from next year on sales and marketing, loyalty programmes and hotel development.
Ladbroke also announced first half pre-tax profits of 72.8 million pounds ($113.5 million) before exceptional items, a 29 percent increase on last year and above analyst forecasts. The interim dividend was unchanged at 2.4 pence per share.
Ladbroke shares added 7.5p to a 1996 high of 215p in early trade before slipping back to close 2p firmer at 209.5p.
The alliance gives HHC a larger presence in the international hotel arena. It offers Ladbroke a major position in American hotels and the chance to participate in the expansion of HHC's U.S. gaming business.
The companies plan to finalise the agreement as soon as possible in order for it to become effective by early 1997.
Bollenbach and Ladbroke chief executive Peter George said the deal would be worth tens of millions of dollars when cost savings and extra sales were combined.
Share analysts applauded the alliance.
""The Hilton tie-up is more extensive than people expected. We are expecting big things from 1998 onwards,"" said Greg Feehely of Kleinwort Benson.
HHC intends to acquire a five percent stake in Ladbroke once the final agreement has been signed. Ladbroke has said it expects to invest significant sums in hotels and casinos developed by its partner in the United States.
""We're putting our money where our mouth is,"" said Bollenbach, a former Walt Disney Company executive who joined HHC in February.
He said one of his first calls at HHC was to his Ladbroke counterpart George. The two men subsequently met several times and even shared a holiday, rafting in Idaho with their wives.
Under the deal, George will join the HHC board while Bollenbach becomes a director of Ladbroke.
The Hilton hotel chain was founded in 1919 when Conrad Hilton opened his first hotel in the Texan town of Cisco.",0
"Executives from British Telecom Plc and MCI Communications Corp were on Saturday attempting to stitch together a $22 billion merger that would turn BT into the world's second largest telecoms group.
MCI, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, sent shock waves through the global communications industry on Friday when it said it was in talks about a takeover by BT.
BT, the dominant player in the British market, has been building its overseas presence in recent years and already has a 20 percent stake in MCI. The two also operate a joint venture known as Concert which serves customers in more than 50 nations.
Analysts are speculating on a price of $40 a share -- valuing MCI at $28 billion and leaving BT with a bill of about $22.1 billion to pay for the remaining 80 percent of MCI.
The deal would be the biggest yet in the rapidly changing telecommunications market and the second largest involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
A BT spokesman confirmed that the BT board was meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI.
He would not be drawn on where the meeting was taking place, saying only that BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield was not in the United States.
The spokesman said an announcement was anticipated prior to the opening of the London stock market on Monday. Sources close to the talks said no announcement was likely on Saturday.
BT and MCI have both said there are no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that any transaction will be consummated.
BT had unsuccessful merger talks earlier this year with British rival Cable & Wireless -- a deal which would have created the world's fifth largest telecoms group by revenue.
Any BT/MCI deal would spawn a massive company with a market capitalisation of some $64 billion, just ahead of AT&T Corp -- the leading, but struggling, U.S. phone company. It would still be some way behind Japanese giant NTT Data Corporation -- the world's largest.
Analysts said a merged company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry where MCI and number three Sprint have been battling AT&T.
Its critical mass would leave it excellently placed to expand into other international markets and new technologies -- MCI possessing the biggest Internet backbone in the U.S.
""This is AT&T Corp's worst nightmare,"" said consultant Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecom.
AT&T said late on Friday that it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.
""We would expect that our government would condition any such merger on the complete and unqualified opening of the telecom market in the United Kingdom,"" it said.
However, analysts regard the British market as broadly open to competition.
For its part, Britain's Trade and Industry Department (DTI) said on Saturday it was too early to say what regulatory hurdles any merger would have to clear.
One potential problem is a media joint venture between MCI and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. BT would end up with MCI's 13 percent non-voting stake in News Corp and this could cause regulatory difficulties in Britain.
British telecoms watchdog Oftel recently banned a joint advertising campaign between BT and satellite broadcaster BSkyB, a company in which News Corp is the main shareholder.",0
"Shares in Pearson Plc slipped on Thursday as the stock market reacted negatively to the appointment of a relatively little-known insider as chief executive of the British media group.
Marjorie Scardino, currently chief executive of The Economist Group that is half owned by Pearson, will succeed Frank Barlow as chief executive at the end of the year.
Dennis Stevenson, who is a non-executive director, becomes deputy chairman now and will take over from Michael Blakenham as chairman at Pearson's annual meeting next May.
The appointment of Scardino ends a long period of uncertainty over the succession to Barlow, 66, who had said he planned to retire by early next year.
But the market greeted her appointment with scepticism, with market players saying they knew little about her. The shares fell to a low of 668 pence, but later recovered to 678 for a loss of 10 pence.
""The market was looking for a big hitter and she wasn't the big name it was looking for,"" one market-maker said in reference to Scardino.
The market was also worried by a report in the Independent newspaper that said Pearson had resolved concerns about the tax implications of selling its stake in British satellite broadcaster BSkyB but faced difficulties separating direct and indirect holdings.
The report said Pearson's indirect stake of around four percent was worth 440 million pounds ($697.4 million) at BSkyB's current share price.
Pearson, which has a market capitalisation of almost four billion pounds, is a sprawling media and leisure company with interests ranging from the Financial Times business newspaper to television soap opera.
Analysts have criticised the company for a lack of a clear strategy and it has long been seen as a potential bid target.
Scardino said she was excited to be joining Pearson.
""It is one of the few companies positioned strongly enough to take advantage of the opportunities in the rapidly changing, digital-driven international marketplace.""
Blakenham, who has been chairman of Pearson since 1983 following a six year stint as chief executive, said in statement the appointments completed the succession process at Pearson.
Barlow, who has been chief executive for seven years, had agreed to extend his contract for two years after his retirement date in 1995 in order to help implement the group's strategy to focus on the media sector.
""I think Pearson's future is very favourable and Marjorie Scardino is a very good appointment,"" he told Reuters.
Scardino, 49, has been chief executive of the Economist since 1992, before which she headed its North American operations.
Prior to that, she was partner in a Savannah, Georgia law firm and publisher and founder with her husband of a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper, the Georgia Gazette.",0
"British media and leisure firm Pearson, awaiting the arrival of a new chief executive, enjoyed a stock market rally on Wednesday after a trading statement which analysts said contained no nasty surprises.
Pearson shares had gained 25p to 714 1/2p by 1300 GMT as a steady trading statement confounded the pessimists who had pushed the shares down to two-month lows on Tuesday.
Texan Marjorie Scardino will take over as Pearson chief executive from January, becoming the first woman to head one of Britain's top 100 companies.
Scardino, who is moving from the 50-percent Pearson-owned Economist Group, is on record as saying that Pearson's profit performance is not good enough.
Many share analysts say that Pearson has yet to complete its 1990s journey from industrial conglomerate to focused media company and that disposals are likely.
They believe Scardino may sell off the company's merchant banking interests and its Tussauds Group theme park and exhibition unit but they expect her to take her time before beginning to mould the company in her image.
Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London merchant bank Lazard Brothers and nine percent holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.
The Tussauds portfolio includes London's famous Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in the UK and Port Aventura in Spain.
There was a sense of relief after Pearson, which has interests ranging from newspaper and book publishing to television, said that trading conditions in the second half of the current year were in line with those of the first six months.
""All in all, it's in line with expectations but that in itself is good as the last few trading updates from the company have been disappointing,"" said Anthony de Larrinaga of brokers Panmure Gordon.
Pearson said that total video retuning costs associated with the launch of the Channel 5 terrestrial television channel next March would rise to around 150 million pounds ($250 million).
This is almost treble the sum initially earmarked for dealing with video recorders affected by interference from the new channel's signal. But it is below the figure quoted in some recent media reports.
Channel 5 has recently been awarded an extra frequency to boost its coverage to 80 percent of the country and Pearson said its business plan showed significantly higher rates of return than in the original bid.
Pearson said the retuning costs and a major film deal with Fox would come out of the 300 million pound original funding agreed by the Channel 5 shareholders. The other shareholders are Britain's United News & Media, U.S. investment firm Warburg Pincus and Luxembourg broadcast group CLT.
This year's losses from Mindscape, Pearson's ailing U.S. consumer software unit, should be in line with earlier forecasts of around 46 million pounds. Pearson also saw no real impact on its 1996 profits from the current strength of sterling.",0

"Glasgow-based Stakis Plc and Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal are the likely purchasers of the Metropole and Princess hotel chains from Lonrho Plc, analysts said on Wednesday.
British conglomerate Lonrho, in the throes of a demerger, said last month it had received interest from potential buyers of the hotels and shelved plans to float them.
The London daily Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the sale of the chains for more than 650 million pounds ($1 billion) could be completed within the next fortnight. There was no immediate comment from Lonrho on the report.
Stakis, which has some 46 British hotels, has refused to comment on reports it planned to buy the five Metropole properties. But the hotels and casino group remains the clear favourite to clinch a deal.
""It would be an excellent fit for Stakis. It's just the size of the deal that could cause concern,"" said analyst Fraser Ramzan of Lehman Brothers.
Markets have speculated that Stakis was planning a rights issue to fund the purchase of the Metropole hotels, valued at about 350 million pounds.
The Metropole group comprises five business and conference hotels located in the British cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside towns of Brighton and Blackpool.
Hotelier Millennium & Copthorne, floated in London this year, has effectively ruled itself out of the race. A company spokesman said Millennium had looked at the Metropole hotels but was not in talks to buy them.
Meanwhile. Prince al-Waleed is believed to be negotiating the purchase of the Princess chain, 10 properties of resorts in the United States, the Caribbean and Mexico.
Financial sources in the Gulf told Reuters this month that al-Waleed had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal at a price of $300 million. The prince has major investments in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, in the banking group Citicorp and Disneyland Paris theme park.
The hotel business is in a growth phase as economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic help drive occupancy rates.
But there have also been a glut of hotel companies coming to Britain's market, with Jarvis Hotels and Thistle following the example of Millennium & Copthorne.
And there are signs of investor indigestion, as witnessed by recent cancellations of stock market floats.
Analysts said investors were now looking much more closely at the merits of individual companies but said they still expected the sector to remain positive into 1997.
""Over the past year, people have become far more discerning about the type of hotel business they become involved in. But that does not mean they are reluctant to invest in the sector,"" said Greg Feehley of Kleinwort Benson.
And if that is the case, there is also no shortage of property on the market, with British media and leisure group Granada selling 17 luxury hotels in Britain and overseas.  The hotels, known as the Exclusive range, were acquired by Granada as part of the 3.9 billion pound takeover of leading British hotelier Forte last January.
American hotel companies ITT Sheraton and Marriott are reportedly among potential purchasers for the chain. A deal is expected to be concluded around the turn of the year.",0
"The planned $20 billion merger of British Telecom and MCI is certain to shake up the global telephone business, officials and analysts said Monday, as regulators started digging in for a close look at the deal.
British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp. on Sunday announced the largest trans-Atlantic takeover in history.
The deal would create a global powerhouse vying with AT&T Corp., Germany's Deutsche Telekom and a handful of other companies in a fast-changing, lucrative industry that will be a critical component of global commerce well into the 21st century.
The proposal will create work aplenty for British, American and European regulators who will review the merger, which would create a $40 billion company serving 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.
For consumers, it could mean better service and lower international calling charges, while the new company would aim to better support its business customers around the world.
It will cause sleepless nights for rivals such as AT&T, Sprint Corp., France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom as they weigh how to respond. Sprint is allied with the French and German companies in the Global One international venture while AT&T is part of a network of alliances called World Partners.
The new company, to be called Concert, plans to take on AT&T's dominance in the U.S. long-distance market, where MCI now has about 20 percent of a $75 billion business, and to win part of the $100 market for residential local phone service.
It also is expected to expand in the Asia-Pacific region -- a long-held aim for British Telecom.
British Telecom's stock jumped in London and New York, where its American shares rose $5.375 to $60.875 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
MCI shares also rose, but only 50 cents to $30.75, well below the possible value of as much as $39 a share based on the price of British Telecom's American shares. Worries about regulatory hurdles and the time to complete the deal held back the stock, industry analysts and takeover specialists said.
The merger still needed to win approval from regulators in America and Britain.
British Telecom said it was optimistic that the European Commission would clear the merger.
British officials have said only that they were looking at the deal. AT&T has already called on the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to give it thorough scrutiny.
AT&T also said U.S. and European regulators should not give approval unless there is more competition in British Telecom's home market.
British Telecom Chief Executive Sir Peter Bonfield has said it could take a year for the deal to win regulatory approval.
""There are a lot of hurdles to be cleared but I think the deal will go through,"" one London-based analyst said.
Federal rules prohibit a foreign company from owning more than 25 percent of a U.S. telephone company if the acquiror's home market is not open to competition.
Under the merger British Telecom, which already owns 20 percent of Washington-based MCI, will issue Concert cash and stock for the remaining 80 percent. Holders of MCI stock will end up controlling around a third of the merged company.
The merged company will acquire the 9 percent stake which MCI holds in Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. media empire. MCI, perhaps wary of regulatory concerns, said on Sunday it did not plan to pursue an option to increase this to 13 percent.",0
"The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) on Thursday launched a probe into the way travel companies sell foreign package holidays to millions of sun-seeking Britons.
The director-general of the consumer watchdog body, John Bridgeman, called a Monopolies and Mergers (MMC) inquiry into ownership links between leading tour operators such as Thomson and Airtours and retail travel agents.
The MMC will also be able to look at the practice among travel agents of offering holidays at a discount conditional on the purchase of specific travel insurance.
Both travel companies said they were confident they would be cleared by the 12-month MMC inquiry. But shares in Airtours plunged almost 10 percent in London, losing 69p to 644p.
Bridgeman noted that vertically-integrated companies like Thomson and Airtours supply a large proportion of a market worth seven billion pounds ($11.5 billion) and he was concerned that some of their practices could distort competition.
""I believe they have the market power to put competitors at a disadvantage, for example by de-racking (removing) or threatening to de-rack their brochures in an attempt to negotiate larger commissions,"" he said.
He also said they could pressurise tour operators not to supply independent travel agents on better terms or push their own holidays through in-house incentive schemes.
Thomson owns the leading Lunn Poly travel agency, while Airtours owns the number two travel agent Going Places.
Together they operate around 40 percent of British travel agents. They also supply around 45 percent of over 10 million foreign packages sold to Britons who make the annual pilgrimage to seek the sun around the Mediterranean or further afield.
Thomson, part of Canada's Thomson Corp, welcomed the probe.
""Thomson is confident that the industry at large, and Thomson in particular, will be vindicated from any allegations of anti-competitive practice,"" said Paul Brett, chairman and chief executive of Thomson Travel.
""We have been cleared by the OFT before in 1994 and we are sure that we will be cleared again by the MMC,"" he added.
Airtours deputy chief executive Harry Coe said there was no case to answer and claimed the British market offered the world's cheapest foreign holidays.
""Those behind the inquiry are the small tour operators and the small travel agents who can't stand the heat in the kitchen,"" he said.
But the smaller tour operators were delighted that the MMC was taking up the matter.",0
"Shares in British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB) rose strongly on Monday after the pay television operator cleared a key regulatory hurdle and amid reports it planned to push ahead and launch digital services in Britain next year.
BSkyB shares added 19p to 495-1/2p by early afternoon, reversing a downward pattern which has seen them shed almost two pounds ($3.3) since mid-October.
The rise was fuelled by an announcement from Britain's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) that it had accepted BSkyB's new terms for the supply of its channels to cable operators.
The stock had earlier been boosted by a report in the Financial Times that BSkyB, 40 percent owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, was poised to order the set-top boxes required to receive its digital satellite services.
""The news flow has been positive and some funds which are underweight in BSkyB have been taking the opportunity to buy,"" said Anthony de Larrinaga of broker Panmure Gordon, commenting on the price rise.
However, he injected a note of caution.
""We still have to see the performance for dish sales in the run-up to Christmas. The decision to push ahead with digital may be partly a reflection of weaker analogue sales,"" he added.
The OFT approved BSkyB's revised ""rate card"" -- setting out the pricing and structure for the supply of satellite channels to cable operators.
""The changes increase the flexibility of cable operators in marketing their services,"" OFT Director General John Bridgeman said in a statement.
But the cable industry criticised the decision and vowed to continue its fight. One option is to take the issue to the European Commission.
""We fail to see how today's announcement is in the consumers' interest,"" the Cable Communications Association said in a statement.
BSkyB, which supplies a diet of top-quality sport and Hollywood movies, has more than five million subscribers -- 3.3 million receiving the service via a satellite dish and almost 1.9 million on cable.
BSkyB's shares have fallen from highs in the last two months because of regulatory concerns in Britain and worries over the apparent slow take-up of the digital services of Germany's DF1, in which BSkyB and Kirch Group are partners.
BSkyB has announced plans to launch digital satellite services supplying some 200 channels into Britain late next year but recent reports had suggested that it could delay the launch.
But the Financial Times quoted Murdoch as saying that BSkyB will go ahead with a decoder box concentrating on new channels plus pay-per-view sport and films. A decoder offering access to interactive services such as home shopping would follow later.
""Now I think we will go with a straight simple box and have a second-generation box a year later. How many people really want to do home shopping and banking on their television sets or buy things, we don't know yet,"" Murdoch was quoted as saying.",0
"The government's surprise decision to block proposed bids for South West Water on Friday seems to make mergers between water firms taboo but keeps open the door to the creation of more multi-utilities, analysts said.
""It is surprising...(now) the idea of multi-utilities is gaining ground, it does look as if that is the platform from which companies can grow,"" said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) head Ian Lang said in a statement he had decided not to permit planned bids by Severn Trent and Wessex Water for South West because they would be against the public interest.
Ian Byatt, head of industry watchdog Ofwat, told Reuters Financial Television such mergers were ""not in my view the best way to get efficiency for customers.""
He added takeovers from outside the water industry ""do not damage competition and my use of (yardsticks) in the same way.""
Wessex Water said on March 7 it wanted to bid for South West, prompting Severn Trent to enter the arena on March 21 but both companies declined to name a price until the DTI, which automatically considers such mergers, announced its decision.
Analysts had suggested such bids might value South West Water at over 950 million pounds ($1.52 billion) or around 750 pence per share.
The two bids were the first by British water companies for one of their colleagues, although France's Lyonnaise des Eaux bought Northumbrian Water last year after promising 15 percent price cuts to 2001.
North West Water took over regional electricity company (REC) Norweb to create United Utilities in January this year while Hyder was formed when Welsh Water bought South Wales Electricity (Swalec).
The DTI's block shook the market, which had been expecting approval conditional on price cuts, possibly up to 20 percent.
Ofwat said it had recommended price cuts of 15 percent from Wessex if its bid were to be approved but had advised that it saw no remedy which would make Severn Trent's bid acceptable.
South West Water's shares plunged to touch a low of 565 pence before recovering slightly to be down 128 pence at 577.5 pence by 1144 GMT.
Severn Trent shares peaked at 619 pence but then eased back to be up 37 pence at 612.5 pence while Wessex added 25 pence to 342.5 pence, off a high of 349 pence.
Relieved of the bid pressure, South West bowed to promptings from Ofwat and said it would pay customers a 15 pound rebate in June 1997 while promising to hike its interim dividend 20.4 percent to 11.8 pence as sector results begin to flow next week.
The company, whose area covers large stretches of coastline requiring hefty investment to meet environmental standards, has the highest customer bills in the country.
Wessex said it was ""disappointed"" that it could not go ahead with a bid, saying it felt a merger would have created ""significant benefits for both customers and investors.""
The utility, which abuts the area of South West Water in western England, said it remained committed to strategic goals of delivering quality service and enhanced shareholder value.
Analysts said Severn Trent might now buyback shares or make a special dividend, despite recent tax changes adverse to these.
Severn Trent said it had expected to offer savings of 27 pounds a year to households from the proposed merger, adding that now it would concentrate on sharing benefits of improved operational performance with shareholders and customers.
Wessex Water, meanwhile, might switch attention to the possibility of a merger with another utility, analysts said.
""Now the government has blocked Wessex from bidding for South West, Southern Electric might take a look,"" said Nigel Hawkins of Yamaichi.",0
"Political pressures ahead of a general election may mean the latest bids in a wave of takeovers of British regional electricity companies (Recs) do not get a rapid nod from the UK government, analysts said on Wednesday.
""A referral (to competition authorities) is a distinct possibility. I think it is a 50-50 shot,"" said Gordon Culfeather, utilities analyst at Greig Middleton.
Seven of the original 12 cash-rich Recs have now been sold in a flurry of takeovers since they came up for grabs last March after the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.
Three of those have been sold to U.S. utilities, who see the UK sector as an opportunity to expand outside U.S. regulatory shackles, particularly into a market which is scheduled to be liberalised to supply competition in 1998.
The latest bid is from  U.S. energy group Dominion Resources which agreed to pay 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion) on Wednesday to take control of East Midlands Electricity, one of only five remaining independent Recs, in an a offer at 670 pence per share.
Northern Electric faces its second hostile approach in less than two years as it battles to throw off a 630 pence per share bid from CE Electric, a unit of U.S.-based CalEnergy, which has already snapped up 29 percent of its target.
Only two bids have so far been blocked by trade secretary Ian Lang, who stunned the market by stopping generators National Power and PowerGen from consuming two Recs earlier this year.
Another two Recs fell prey to their regional water and sewerage companies, while industrial conglomerate Hanson picked up Eastern Electricity, which it now aims to spin off as part of a separate business under its demerger plans.
The remaining victim was Manweb, which succumbed to Scottish Power, an aggressively expansive electricity generator and distributor based in Scotland.
Dominion and East Midlands said they saw no reason for their deal to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), adding that a meeting was scheduled with industry watchdog Offer, which initially consults on bids.
""If Lang was following a consistent route, he would not stop these latest bids,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
""But if I were a regulator, I would probably want at least five firms to make comparisons,"" he added.
Offer head Stephen Littlechild will send his advice on both bids to Lang for the trade secretary to decide whether they should be referred to the MMC.
Another pressure on Lang is the prospect of a general election, which must be held by May 1997, with the opposition Labour party running ahead in opinion polls and allegations of sleaze miring the current Conservative government.
Its privatisations, which have seen most of Britain's strategic industries sold off, have been heavily criticised for huge executive pay packets, hefty shareholder payouts and heady takeovers which value firms well above privatisation levels.
Labour, which has vowed to levy a ""windfall"" tax on privatised utilities, said in an opening salvo on the latest bids that it planned ""tough, efficient regulation wherever necessary in the privatised utilities and we intend to see it enforced whoever is the owner.""
Lang could chose to refer the bids to the MMC in order to delay any decision on this hot political issue beyond an election, some analysts said.
The market on Wednesday showed its concerns by capping share prices at well below the bid levels, with Northern trading at 592 pence per share by 1450 GMT and East Midlands at 623 pence.",0
"Cable & Wireless Communications, a major new British cable operator formed on Tuesday from a group led by Cable & Wireless Plc, has the potential to be competitive and focuses attention on the fast-growing area, analysts said.
""The logic is irrefutable...the advantages of scope and size are undoubtedly there,"" said Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull analyst John Tysoe.
Cable & Wireless, NYNEX Corp of the U.S. and Bell Canada International announced they would merge the operations of their British subsidiaries in a complex deal, culminating in a float of 15 percent of the new company.
""That creates an integrated second force, which will give BT a run for its money,"" Tysoe said, referring to telecommunications giant British Telecommunications.
Shares in Cable & Wireless closed up 25.5 pence to 466.5, after touching a high of 476.5 pence, while NYNEX Cable Communications gained 23.5 pence to 119.5 pence.
""It's a jolly bold and impressive move,"" said one sector analyst.
The merger should result in quite significant cost savings, said Chris McFadden of Merrill Lynch, including tax offsets, refinancing of high-yield cable television funding and possibly through staff cuts.
""The new company can offer the complete range of services and it will be competing with BT in the franchises which it operates,"" the sector analyst said.
Analysts added that the deal was expected to dilute earnings slightly in the first year but enhance them from year two.
BT's shares edged down four pence to 354 pence as the market weighed the emergence of a new competitor.
But BT welcomed the consolidation in the sector, saying it would create a market ""where competition can become the natural regulator.""
Analysts said BT's calls to be allowed to provide cable television, which the Conservative government has so far rebuffed, could gain impetus from the emergence of Cable & Wireless Communications.
For other cable companies, the move has focused market attention, which had been flagging, back on the fast-growing sector, with stock market valuations now looking a little low.
""People are reassessing the value (of cable companies). There could be more consolidation. They have to respond,"" McFadden said, adding that calculations suggested a 2.9 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) tag for C&W's Mercury unit after the deal.
Telewest Communications shares jumped 12 pence to 135, while General Cable gained 18 to 197 pence.
The British cable market is growing fast, with around 7.5 million homes now within striking distance of connections, as around six billion pounds has already been invested in building cable networks and a further six billion is planned.
The new company will eclipse its rivals in terms of market share, with 2.47 million homes within reach, compared with its nearest rival, Telewest, with around two million.
But analysts said it would not be in direct competition with other cable network companies as they mainly operated in different franchises.
Cable & Wireless Communications may flex its muscles in securing more favourable terms for programming from BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster in which Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has a 40 percent stake, analysts said.
BSkyB shares were down 16-1/2p to 680p, after touching a low of 678p.",0
"British water and sewerage company South West Water turned in sparkling first half profits on Thursday and hiked its dividend by an expected 20 percent, promising further increases in years to come.
The company, which evaded takeover earlier this year when two proposed bids were blocked by the UK government, said it expected to raise its total dividend by 20 percent this year and make real a rise of eight percent ""for the foreseeable future"".
South West Water's pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 rose to 72.9 million pounds ($121.4 million) up 35 percent and ahead of expectations of 57 to 68 million pounds.
It paid out a dividend of 11.8 pence as promised when the bids, from Severn Trent and Wessex, were unexpectedly halted by the UK government in October.
""The dividend policy will continue to be based on the pursuit of progressive growth,"" the company said in a statement.
But the half year surge in profits was unlikely to be repeated, finance director Ken Hill told Reuters. ""I do not think a 35 percent increase in PBT (profit before tax) is likely to occur at the end of this year,"" he said, nor in years immediately following. ""But we are looking for profit increases,"" he added.
Shares in the company closed three pence up at 580 after touching a high of 589 pence.
Anglian Water, which reported last week, saw half year profits rise 5.5 percent and raised its dividend 14.6 percent. Thames Water, which kicked off the flow of interim results in the sector on October 29, turned in pretax profits before exceptionals up 15 percent and raised its dividend 22 percent.
South West Water has also committed to pay out a rebate of 15 pounds each to customers after the planned bids were blocked but Hill warned further rebates would not be automatic.
The company failed last year in a bid to have price caps imposed by regulator Ofwat raised as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said it should find an extra 100 million pounds it said it needed for environmental upgrades from efficiencies.
It has since made an earlier rebate of 10 pounds to customers, announced additional investment of 74 million pounds and brought forward 20 million pounds of investment in cleaning up at Newquay, a favourite beach area for surfers. Hill said the company's strategy now was to ""focus on the core business...and develop very carefully the strategy of the non-regulated businesses.""
Dividend payouts would be helped by efficiency savings and improved profitability in its non-regulated businesses, which contributed 6.6 million pounds to interim profits, executives told a press conference.
Chairman Keith Court told journalists the company aimed to balance turnover contributions of non-regulated and regulated businesses ""as soon as we can.""
New acquisitions contributed around 3.5 million pounds to operating profits of some 7.5 million pounds in non-regulated business this year and Hill said there was between 100 and 200 million pounds available to make further purchases.
But there are no specific plans for acquisitions. ""Our track record shows...we are not frightened (of making acquisitions) but it is a question of finding ones that make sense,"" Colin Drummond, head of the group's non-core division, said.
At the same time, the company's balance sheet was strong enough to effect a share buyback if it decided to make use of a mandate to buy 10 percent of shares, Hill said.",0
"British opposition Labour party's plans for a one-off ""windfall"" tax on utility companies may be causing more stock market damage through uncertainty than the tax itself would, analysts said on Thursday.
If it won the next general election, due within six months, Labour has said it would levy a tax to reap excess profits from recently privatised utilities to help pay for welfare reform.
""The market does not like uncertainty -- give it a tax like this with no parameters and it will assume the worst-case scenario,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
As parliament prepared to debate the issue, at the prompting of the ruling Conservatives, analysts said if the Labour party would be more specific about plans, some of the uncertainty weighing on utility shares might lift.
""They have promised to raid the utilities but they have not said which, how much or when, and that is damaging,"" said Philip Hollobone, analyst at Williams de Broe.
Labour, which is well ahead in opinion polls, has said it would use the funds to tackle youth and long-term unemployment but has declined to set target companies, amounts or timeframes.
Newspaper reports have suggested the tax might be aimed at raising more than five billion pounds ($8.42 billion) and possibly as much as 10 billion pounds.
Speculation on possible targets has widened to include up to 30 companies, like British Telecom, British Gas and perhaps airport operator BAA Plc, in addition to the water and electricity companies initially pointed to.
Some of these, such as BAA, have already rehearsed arguments why they should not be included in any windfall tax net.
The water and electricity sectors, privatised around the start of the decade by the Conservatives, became unpopular after a spate of huge executive pay rises, hefty dividend payouts, and head-turning takeovers deals.
One analyst who declined to be named, suggested that the water sector stocks are currently undervalued by around five billion pounds, reflecting concerns over the tax.
Thames Water, for example, has underperformed the FT All Share Index by as much as 10 percent since late August, according Reuters Securities 3000 data, although its relative has improved recently to underperformance of some four percent.
Shares in regional electricity companies, however, were pulled in two directions as a resurgence of bids in the sector boosted speculation which analysts said may have offset some of the downside of a utility tax.
""The worries over the windfall tax are severely overdone...even if it does happen, most companies will be able to find the money, even if they do not want to,"" said Hollobone.
Along with several other analysts, he warns that even if Labour does win power it may not be able to effect the tax because of legal problems in ensuring it is non-discriminatory.
Several utility companies have said they would challenge any windfall tax plans in court, but Labour's treasury spokesman Gordon Brown described the proposal as ""legally iron tight.""
On Thursday, the Institute of Directors (IoD), which represents British business interests, warned against the tax although it acknowledged that ""some of the utilities do have spare funds at the moment.""
The IoD said the tax could lead to problems over who should pay what amounts and said customers might face increased prices.
The Conservatives have claimed the tax could mean an extra 192 pounds on the average household bill and challenged Labour to come up with figures to contradict this.
""Investors who are wise to the market's over-caution on the proposed tax are buying. These stocks are undervalued and...some are yielding more than long-term bonds,"" said one analyst.",0
"Tax changes on long-term assets made in the British budget sparked falls in utility sector stocks on Wednesday but analysts said the concerns might be overdone and expected the sector to recover.
""It is not a welcome move but it should not be a disaster. I do not think it should have a significant impact,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
The changes, proposed by finance minister Kenneth Clarke in the budget on Tuesday, cut capital allowances on assets with a working life of over 25 years to six percent from 25 percent.
The Treasury said it hoped to raise around 1 billion pounds ($1.68 billion) over three years from the move.
Shares in utilities fell across the board, with water company Anglian Water down five pence to 566 pence at 1150 GMT, Yorkshire Water losing seven pence to 677 pence and Severn Trent slipping nine pence to 671 pence.
Multi-utility Hyder slid 18 pence to 738 pence.
Among energy and power companies, PowerGen shed eight pence to 571.5 pence and Yorkshire Electricity lost 7.5 pence to 772 pence.
""The tax changes are definitely why the shares are down,"" one analyst said. The proposals will affect companies spending over 100,000 pounds a year on long-term fixed assets with exceptions for shipping and rail businesses and office buildings.
Utilities could be particularly vulnerable because they have large amounts of infrastructure and plant which will require future investment, analysts said.
""But a billion pounds across all companies means the impact will be pretty small for each business,"" one analyst said.
Companies were largely unwilling to comment immediately on the likely impact, with United Utilities and Southern Electric both saying it was too early to assess.
But both companies might give further details when they report half year results on Thursday, analysts said.
The change has been seen by some observers as pre-empting the opposition Labour party's proposals for a one-off ""windfall"" tax levy on utilities for what are seen as excess past profits.
These plans, from a party which is well ahead of the Conservative government in polls running up to a general election in the next six months, have been keeping a dampener on utility stocks recently.
Analysts said the changes in the budget would mean that any windfall tax imposed by a Labour government might hit companies harder.
Estimates are that a Labour government might seek to raise five billion pounds or more from such a measure in order to finance measures to combat youth and long-term unemployment.
At the same time, Labour might seek to reverse the changes on capital allowances, analysts said, as it pushes for increased investment by companies.
""These measures could reduce Labour's ability to push ahead with any windfall tax, on the other hand the party might repeal the changes to encourage investment,"" the analyst said.",0
"British water and sewerage company South West Water saw half year profits surge on Thursday and it hiked its dividend 20 percent, as expected, with a promise of real dividend increases of eight percent in coming years.
""The dividend policy will continue to be based on the pursuit of progressive growth,"" the company said in a statement.
South West Water's pretax profits for the six months ending September 30 rose to 72.9 million pounds ($120.4 million), up 35 percent and ahead of expectations which were between 57 and 68 million pounds.
It had promised to pay out an interim dividend of 11.8 pence when two proposed bids for it, from Severn Trent and Wessex, were blocked by the UK government in October.
In a statement, the company said it hoped to raise the total dividend for the year by 20 percent and then reach eight percent real increases in the annual payout to shareholders.
But the half year surge in profits was unlikely to be repeated, finance director Ken Hill told Reuters.
""I do not think a 35 percent increase in PBT (profit before tax) is likely to occur at the end of this year,"" he said, nor in years immediately following. ""But we are looking for profit increases,"" he added.
Shares in the company gained five pence to 582.5 pence by 0940 GMT.
Anglian Water, which reported last week, saw half year profits rise 5.5 percent and raised its dividend 14.6 percent.
Thames Water, which kicked off the flow of interim results in the sector on October 29, turned in pretax profits before exceptionals up 15 percent and raised its dividend 22 percent.
South West Water has also committed to pay out a rebate of 15 pounds each to customers after trade secretary Ian Lang blocked the bids, which were awaiting approval before being priced.
Hill said the company's strategy now was to ""focus on the core business...and develop very carefully the strategy of the non-regulated businesses.""
South West Water has interests in waste management, environmental instrumentation and construction services, which contributed 6.6 million pounds to profits in the first half.
Hill said recent tax changes affecting some share buy backs would not alter the company's strategy of only using its mandate if it were in the interests of shareholders.
South West Water said a complicated financing deal which involves standby letters of credit which are counter-indemnified by cash deposits had contributed 5.7 million pounds to first half profits.
The facility should boost annual profits by nine million pounds in each of the next three years, the company added.
It said capital expenditure was 61.6 million pounds in the first half of the year and ""a further substantial uplift is planned for the second half.""
Water leakage, an issue which has triggered severe criticism of water companies from politicians and lobby groups, has been cut to 21 percent from 28 percent in 1992, the company said.
Its target of only 15 percent of water leaking from infrastructure by 1999 should be reached, it added.
The company's non-executive chairman Keith Court steps down in February and a replacement is being sought after non-executive deputy chairman Alan Fletcher bowed out.",0
"British supermarket retailer J. Sainsbury Plc expects its new banking venture to turn in profits ""in a relatively short period of time,"" marketing director Kevin McCarten told Reuters in an interview.
""We see this as a commercial venture...it is not a huge sink of money,"" he said.
Sainsbury announced on Friday that it had applied for authorisation from the Bank of England to set up Sainsbury's Bank in which it would have 55 percent with Bank of Scotland taking 45 percent.  
He said the banking service would offer ""great products...at better value than is currently available,"" but declined to comment on possible interest rates on accounts.
Sainsbury will draw on its database of customers signed up to its Reward loyalty card and other store cards for direct marketing of the banking facilities, McCarten said, but added that it was not planning to limit access to these customers.
""Our objective is to build (the business) across the UK,"" he said.  
Sainsbury currently has about five stores in Scotland, while Bank of Scotland will benefit because it has a limited presence south of the border.
""It's a lovely distribution channel,"" a Bank of Scotland spokesman told Reuters, adding that the new bank would have its own identity and would not carry the Bank of Scotland logo.
McCarten said there would not initially be banking counters in stores but added it could not be ruled out for the future.  
No decision has yet been reached on use of cash dispensers, the Bank of Scotland spokesman said, although he ruled out stand-alone machines.
McCarten said the banking facilities would be ""completely separate"" from its Reward loyalty card other than using the database.
He added that the aim was to encourage customers to see banking as part of Sainsbury's supermarket offer, which should have a knock-on effect for the stores.
""If you can increase customer spend a little, you grow your business,"" McCarten said.",0
"London Electricity on Tuesday became the latest British regional electricity company (Rec) to attract bid speculation after U.S. firm Entergy was reported to be mulling a 1.2 billion pound bid.
London Electricity declined comment on a report in the Wall Street Journal Europe that confidential documents showed the U.S. company was seeking 1.1 billion pounds to acquire an unnamed British electricity firm whose financial profile matched that of London Electricity.
Entergy told Reuters that any talks with another party were ""too early in the scheme of things to be really meaningful.""
""As far as specifying a target of that interest, we're not simply going to comment on what has been speculated and rumoured,"" Entergy spokesman Patrick Sweeney said.
However, he declined to deny the Wall Street Journal Europe article.
Shares in London Electicity touched a high of 671 pence before easing back to close at 667 pence, up 30-1/2 pence. The newspaper article said confidential Entergy company documents referred to used a code name ""Atlantic"" for the target company whose financial profile met that of London Electricity on a number of points.
The Journal said the bid was assumed in the documents to be for around 700 pence per share. The newspaper quoted Entergy's Sweeney as saying Entergy was interested in the British market and ""obviously if you're interested, one of the results could be an acquisition.""
The article followed a denial by Entergy on Monday of a report in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper that the U.S. firm was considering a bid for Yorkshire Electricity Group Plc. The electricity sector has seen a flurry of bid speculation recently over the five remaining independent Recs. Northern Electric currently faces its second hostile offer in less than two years as it tries to fend off a $1.225 billion.",0
"British utilities could find share buybacks and takeovers more costly as the government ruled out tax credits on buybacks and some special dividends on Tuesday, analysts said, but they are unlikely to stop such moves.
""It should not stop companies doing buybacks or special dividends,"" said Michael Cohen, utilities analyst at Salomon Brothers, ""those should still go ahead if justified.""
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke said shareholders would no longer be able to claim tax credits on share buybacks or special dividends associated with share consolidations or takeovers.  
The move is a means of giving the UK Treasury more room for a cut in income tax in its November budget, analysts said.
Shares in the utility sector, which has seen a steady flow of buybacks and special dividends both within and outside the context of takeovers, initially slumped on the news but later showed some recovery.
""It was a knee-jerk reaction, slightly overdone,"" said Kevin Lapwood, utilities analyst at Merrill Lynch.  
Shares in Anglian Water slid 31-1/2 to a low of 525 pence before edging back to 544-1/2 pence at 1300 GMT while Yorkshire Water was down 17-1/2 pence at 622-1/2 pence after slumping to a low of 613 pence.
In the electricity sector, London Electric stumbled to a low of 598 pence before recovering to be down 20-1/2 pence at 608-1/2 pence while generator PowerGen was off 10-1/2 pence at 479 pence from a low of 460 pence earlier.
""The market was of the view that release of value from the balance sheets was less likely, but I think that was overdone,"" Lapwood said.  
Water and electricity companies report half-year results in a flood between November and December and several had been tipped as likely to offer a buyback or special dividend.
Analysts said the upshot of the government's decision would be to make buybacks more expensive, but the impetus for such moves will not change.
""The logic of a buyback has not changed, it will just be at a premium. And the move on special dividends could make takeovers more expensive, but if it is a good acquisition, it will go ahead,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.  
Companies are generally reticent about specific plans and several contacted declined to comment on the new tax rules or share strategies.
Analysts suggested that of the water companies, Yorkshire Water might consider a buyback while Anglian and Thames might consider restructuring the balance sheet.
East Midlands Electricity, Yorkshire Electricity and London Electric were singled out as potentially considering special dividends, while the market is still waiting to see such a move from PowerGen, analysts said.
""It does not really affect the companies, just a group of investors,"" Cohen said.
Those funds affected by the move are likely to change investments to try to avoid any impact, analysts said.
""At the end of the day it will probably end up roughly equal,"" the analyst said.
""Gross funds will restructure and companies will come out with cleverer mechanisms,"" he added.",0
"Shares in Britain's second biggest supermarket chain J. Sainsbury Plc rose on Wednesday after the group held out hope of an improved performance despite a fall in half year profits and sluggish sales.
""The share price rise is a triumph of hope over statistics,"" said one sector analyst.
Sainsbury, which last year was overtaken as market leader by arch-rival Tesco, said half year pre-tax profits slipped, as analysts expected, to 393 million pounds ($637.4 million) from 456 million pounds in the same period last year.
Sainsbury also announced a dividend of 3.5 pence per share, up from 3.4 pence.
The company suffered its first fall in full year profits in 22 years when it reported in May. Pre-tax earnings before exceptional items fell 5.5 percent to 764 million pounds in the business year to March 9, 1996.
After Wednesday's results, several analysts cut forecasts for the current full year to 710-725 million pounds, a level some analysts were already predicting, market sources said.
But shares closed up 8.5 pence to 363.5 pence, in a market which was generally easier after an unexpected quarter-point rise in British interest rates.
The group said current sales from comparable stores, excluding petrol, were rising in line with inflation of around three percent, well below the 7.5-percent gain reported by Tesco in September.
A sector analyst who asked not to be named said ""Sales moving in line with inflation is pretty disappointing, considering they've introduced the loyalty card.""
The Reward card is now accounting for much of the increase in sales Sainsbury is currently seeing.
""Clearly, we want to do better (than three percent)"", chairman David Sainsbury told Reuters. ""This year will be about getting the basics right, next year will be about getting profits moving.""
The company said marketing and operations initiatives along with the Reward card should continue to help boost sales and provide a strong Christmas season.
""We will be fighting on our traditional ground of quality and choice, along with customer loyalty,"" Sainsbury said.
Sainsbury, which last week announced plans to launch a bank with Bank of Scotland, said there would be another ""major development"" on Reward soon and that it would move to strengthen its leadership in quality and choice.",0
"Britain's Northern Electric is set to rush out a glowing set of figures aimed at persuading the market that the 630 pence per share hostile bid by CE Electric is too low, analysts said on Friday.
The regional electricity company (Rec) said it would bring its half-year results forward from a scheduled date of December 5 when it rejected U.S.-based CE Electric's bid on Monday. Industry sources expect the results to come some time next week.
Northern could boost its case with an improved gearing forecast after a 560 million pound ($918.6 million) package for shareholders which helped it fend off last year's bid from Trafalgar House.
""The critical answer is interim results, especially the balance sheet, which could be stronger than expected,"" said David Campbell of Greig Middleton.
Northern has said that CE Electric, which is 70 percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., had indicated a price of 700 pence per share, but that claim was denied by the Americans, who said their $1.225 billion bid was a full and fair price.
Since the bid on Monday, there have been no further talks between the companies, industry sources said, and CE Electric has snapped up around 13 percent of Northern's shares.
The share price has struggled to rise above the offer level, which was at a premium of 21.2 percent to the last closing prices before the bid, and On Friday was trading at 631.5 pence, down two pence.
""I think Northern should be able to force a higher price but the critical factor is portfolio investors, who may prefer an instant 630 pence rather than a possible higher number,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Northern's costly defence against Trafalgar House, the only successful rebuttal by any of the eight Recs which have faced bids since privatisation in 1990, has left it with little more to offer, analysts said, which could keep a lid on the shares.
There is also scepticism a rival bid will emerge, as the remaining four independent and cash-rich Recs could be more attractive without the operational rationale of CE Electric, which wants to add supply expertise to its generating business.
Electricity sector shares were led higher last Friday by East Midlands Electricity, which was seen as the most attractive bid candidate before CE Electric launched its offer for Northern.
Northern is likely to report pretax profits slightly down at around 50 million pounds from 58.7 million pounds a year ago and raise the dividend by seven percent to near 13 pence.
Gearing could come in around 125 percent and show signs of falling to 100 percent or less, analysts said, from peaks nearer 170 percent under the impact of the costly defence package.
The market is also waiting for CE Electric, in which U.S. construction, mining and telecoms company Peter Kiewit Sons has a 30 percent stake, to post its offer document. This move will set the 60-day clock ticking for the takeover timetable.
At the same time, electricity industry watchdog Offer has started a review of the bid, requesting comments by November 7.
Analysts said Offer's move might have contributed to dampening Northern's share price by triggering concerns the bid might be referred to British competition authorities.
There appears to be little precedent for such a referral, however, as three Recs have already fallen to U.S. companies with approval from the government.
But last week's surprise decision to block rival bids for water utility South West Water from its colleagues Severn Trent and Wessex has unsettled the market, analysts said.
The Conservative government, well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls with no more than six months to go before a general election, might see Northern's takeover as a political hot potato.
Labour, traditionally against privatisation and fiercely critical of takeovers in the sector, might take an additional interest in Northern as it supplies the party leader Tony Blair's constituency in north east England.",0
"Virginia-based Dominion Resources Inc., continuing an American invasion of the recently privatised utility industry in Britain, agreed Wednesday to acquire East Midlands Electricity Plc for about 1.3 billion pounds ($2.15 billion).
Executives from Dominion met East Midlands management late Tuesday to offer 6.7 pounds ($11.07) a share for one of five remaining independent electric companies in Britain.
But East Midlands shares languished well below the offer price Wednesday as concerns emerged that the bid might face obstacles from British competition authorities.
""Everyone's expecting the MMC (Monopolies and Mergers Commission) to take a close look at the deal,"" said one trader.
Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., said last week it was considering a bid ""at a price not much in excess of 608 pence per share."" But East Midlands scorned that price, saying it would undervalue the Nottingham-based electricity company.
East Midlands Chairman Sir Nigel Rudd said Wednesday that his board was recommending the latest offer ""because it represents fair value for an excellent business, which has successfully differentiated itself from the sector.""
Seven of Britain's original 12 regional electricity companies have already been bought -- four by U.S. firms -- since they came up for grabs last March when the government's protective golden share expired, five years after privatisation in 1990.
""Dominion's offer looks a fair compromise price,"" said Chris Perry, utilities analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.
But he added that there were ""very genuine concerns"" that the offer might be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Dominion Chief Financial Officer Linwood Robertson said in an interview that the company was talking to the regulator.
""We intend to run this as a stand-alone business,"" he said, adding that he certainly hoped for approval.
He also said the group hoped to keep East Midlands' management team, which is highly regarded by industry analysts.
Robertson said Dominion looked forward to the diversification East Midlands would bring to it and said the U.S. company would bring strengths to the British firm.
Dominion's stock gained 37.5 cents to $40.125 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",0
"Britain's decision to take legal action to ban Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) on non-prescription medicines is likely to boost competition and could benefit some stores in terms of market share, analysts said on Friday.
""Anything that actually causes prices to fall is not good news (for retailers), but for those wanting to increase market share it will mean more people coming through the stores,"" said one share analyst who asked not to be identified.
Office of Fair Trading head John Bridgeman said in a statement earlier that he would seek to remove RPM from over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, because ""there are good reasons for believing that it is time to end price-fixing.""
RPM allows manufacturers to set minimum levels for sale of certain over-the-counter medicines. The Community Pharmacy Action Group, which lobbies on behalf of pharmacies, said its removal could mean the closure of one in four local outlets.
The OFT's request goes to the Restrictive Practices Court which is unlikely to be able to consider the issue before late 1997, Bridgeman told a press conference.
Retailers therefore did not appear to be about to start an immediate round of price cuts.
Chemist and beauty products store chain Boots said it was disappointed at the decision and believed that RPM ""operates in the public interest.""
Boots has not reduced prices of such medicines during a long-running inquiry into price-fixing and industry sources said it was unlikely to take that route in the near future.
UniChem, a pharmaceuticals wholesaler and retailer, said removal of RPM would be ""immaterial to...profitability,"" while Superdrug, the high street chemist chain owned by Kingfisher, welcomed the move but ruled out immediate price cuts.
Supermarket retailer ASDA, which has led the campaign over the last year to have RPM removed after successfully lobbying for it to be withdrawn from books, also welcomed the OFT's decision, saying it could save consumers 300 million pounds ($476 million) on everday healthcare products.
But it said its stance on prices would not change.
""RPM is still in place, we are still in the same situation we were in yesterday and we will still be in it tomorrow,"" a spokesman said.
ASDA is currently refusing to sell Anadin Paracetamol, a painkiller produced by Whitehall Laboratories, and large packs of indigestion treatment Alka Seltzer, after it baulked at manufacturers' price increases.
It has launched a range of some 40 own-brand OTC medicines and vitamins selling for as little as half the price of branded equivalents, and says they have helped it extend market share.
Also on Friday, ASDA said it was launching an initiative to help support local pharmacies, shops which chief executive Allan Leighton told BBC television he had no wish to see put out of business.
Share analysts said that removal of RPM on non-prescription medicines could see specialists such as Boots increasing market share, reflecting events after RPM was taken off books when specialist retailer W H Smith increased market share.
""Smiths got stronger, increasing market share through promotions and using muscle with suppliers. I expect the same will happen to Boots - it'll get bigger and stronger,"" said Nick Bubb of MeesPierson.",0
"A unit of CalEnergy Co., a fast-growing, Nebraska-based energy company, Monday launched a $1.2 billion takeover bid for British regional utility Northern Electric Plc, which promptly rejected the unsolicited offer.
The bid is the latest for a British power company and the second for Northern Electric in just over a year. Industry analysts said Northern Electric might end up agreeing to a takeover if it could extract a higher price.
Omaha, Neb.-based CalEnergy, through its 70 percent-owned CE Electric unit, said it would pay 630 British pence ($10.06) for each common share and 103 pence ($1.64) for each preferred share of Northern Electric, making the deal worth about $1.23 billion. The U.S.-based construction and mining company Peter Kiewit Sons owns the other 30 percent of CE Electric.
Northern Electric successfully fended off a hostile bid last year from Trafalgar House, now owned by Sweden's Kvaerner, by offering a special package worth 560 million pounds ($894 million) for shareholders.
""Our strategy is to become a leading global provider of a full range of energy services,"" CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol said in a statement announcing the offer.
Sokol's company has invested in geothermal and other energy projects at home and in Indonesia and the Philippines in recent years. Its core operations are in California, New York and Texas, and the bid for Northern Electric is a major move outside the U.S. market.
U.S. utilities, faced with slow growth and deregulation in their local markets, have been merging in the United States and investing abroad as they seek to grow.
Sokol said Northern Electric, based in northeastern England, had distribution and supply know-how that would complement CalEnergy's production capacity, while its size was ""very manageable.""
""They are the smallest regional electricity company and that means that you can get them cheaper,"" said one analyst who asked not to be identified.
""We will see an agreed bid eventually,"" said Philip Hollobone at brokers Williams de Broe, who said CE Electric might eventually raise its price to secure agreement from Northern's board of directors.
In its statement rejecting the bid, Northern Electric said that in talks through Sunday, CE Electric had contemplated offering about 700 pence ($11.17) per share.
""Northern Electric is clearly saying you can have us for 700 pence per share,"" said one sector analyst who asked not to be identified.
CE Electric, which bought a 12.7 percent stake in Northern in the open market, said that it never suggested ""any intent to value the company at 'around 700 pence per share' or even anywhere close to this figure.""
Sokol said he felt the offer was ""a very full price,"" adding that CE Electric had sought a merger agreement with Northern Electric but ""the only area we could not agree on was value.""
Some analysts said Northern Electric's weak balance sheet would limit what CE Electric would be willing to bid and that it might be hoping to attract another bidder. The special shareholders' package it paid to fend off Trafalgar House left it heavily in debt.
Northern Electric stock jumped 131 pence ($2.09) to close at 651 pence ($10.40) after CE Electric had managed to buy its 12.72 percent stake at the offered price earlier in the session.
CalEnergy announced in August that it bought three gas-fired cogeneration plants in Texas, Pennsylvania and New York for $226 million from Falcon Seaboard Resources Inc., a closely held energy company.",0

"British spirits, pubs and fast food group Allied Domecq on Tuesday reported a fall in annual profits but effectively ruled out a demerger as a solution to its problems.
Allied chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said in a statement the company was ""clear that the best way to improve shareholder value is to improve operating performance and that this should be our overriding objective for the foreseeable future.""
He disappointed market hopes of a demerger of the company's spirits and wines business, saying this option had been ""thoroughly reviewed"" and the company was ""intent on developing the group's two principal businesses.""
Full-year pretax profits to August before exceptionals slipped to 575 million pounds ($947.4 million) from 645 million previously but were within analyst forecasts of between 560 and 581 million.
Allied Domecq said exceptional losses for the year totalled 311 million pounds, the largest part of which was on the 205 million pound sale of its 50 percent stake in brewer Carlsberg-Tetley to Bass in August.
Allied paid out a total dividend of 23.59 pence a share, unchanged from the year ending March 1995, which was used as a comparison because of a change to its accounting period.
""The figures were very much in line with expectations. Some people had been worried the dividend may be cut but it has been maintained and that's a positive,"" one analyst, who asked not to be identified, said.
Allied's shares eased 10 pence to 458 pence by 1040 GMT.
""The divisions have gone in the direction expected but if you were someone who wanted action -- a demerger or management change -- you haven't got either and there will be disappointment,"" the analyst said.
Allied said its corporate restructuring had been largely completed with the sale of its stake in Carlsberg-Tetley and smaller food companies.
Hogg said the group ""must improve the returns it delivers to shareholders."" He said an essential part of this was recognising and remedying overstocking of spirits distributors.
The cost of tackling overstocking of U.S. spirits was the main factor in a 14 percent fall in year trading profits in the group's spirits and wines business, the company said.
Allied said it was ""determined to increase prices (in spirits and wines) where we can,"" adding that strong brands and market leadership were the best basis for achieving this.
The company said it hoped the division would benefit from the increasing focus on key brand/market combinations, more favourable shipment patterns and from efficiency gains.
But it warned that the trading environment ""may offer little prospect of improvement."" The group's retailing business, which includes pubs and fast food outlets, saw underlying profits rise four percent during the year and Allied said it saw further opportunities for developing its leading pub brands.
""The company has said they can grow earnings and that's the way to create shareholder value,"" the analyst said.",0
"British electricity transmission business National Grid should report a rise in half year profits on November 26 and could explain how it will cope with new pricing controls that come into effect on April 1, 1997.
""We will be looking for indications on how they are going to cope, whether there will be any cost cutting,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
Analysts expect National Grid's first half profits to range from 279 to 304 million stg, up from 278.9 million previously. A dividend payout of 4.45 to 4.9 pence per share is forecast.  
The company, which was floated in December 1995, capitulated in October to revised transmission pricing proposed by industry watchdog Offer which included a one-off reduction of 20 percent in the first year starting April 1, 1997.
For the following three years, price increases will be capped at four points below inflation.
National Grid had called Offer's original proposals of a one-off cut between 20 and 26 percent ""contrived, illogical and inconsistent.""  
The company said when it accepted the revised controls that it would introduce further measures to improve efficiency but that the cuts would have ""a material impact on transmission business profitability.""
""Does the review mean that its finances are going to be hit hard?"" asked the analyst. ""I feel it needs to justify its capitulation, which sold shareholders down the river,"" he added.
National Grid chief executive said at the time price cuts were agreed that he was confident of maintaining a ""progressive"" dividend policy but analysts said clearer indications would be welcomed.  
The market will also be watching for updates on progress in finding a partner for its Energis telecommunications service.
Energis said in October that it was on track to announcing a link with an international carrier within a year.
Energis made an operating loss of 72.8 million stg last year but expects to break even in 1999/2000.
National Grid shares were up 6p in late trade on Friday at 192p.",0
"Electricity stocks crackled higher on Friday as rumours swirled around the market of a U.S. buyer for one of five remaining regional utilities and analysts said the forthcoming results season could provide a spur for action.
""There is going to be a big focus on the ability of these companies to hand out more cash...if the results season is not going to get it going, then nothing will,"" said Chris Perry, analyst at Charterhouse Tilney.
Electricity sector companies kick off their half year results season towards the end of November.
Leading the sector higher on Friday was East Midlands Electricity, after a report in the Daily Mail newspaper that a bid might emerge from Houston Industries of the United States at around 750 pence a share.
Houston, tipped to buy one of the five remaining regional electricity companies (Recs) earlier this year, had been thought to have given up on the idea in August when it bought U.S. gas utility NorAm Energy for $3.8 billion.
East Midlands shot up to a high of 565 pence but eased back to close at 562, up 44 pence.
""At the time of its last results, the company effectively indicated its surprise that it hadn't been taken over. Their shares had fallen back a long way and perhaps it's no surprise that bid rumours are re-emerging,"" Perry said.
Other power utilities which remain independent also climbed, with Yorkshire Electricity up 28 pence to 742 pence and Southern Electric adding 13.5 pence to 631 pence.
Northern Electric, which survived a takeover bid from Trafalgar House last year, was up 29 pence to 523 pence and London Electricity, which supplies the capital with power, jumped 18.5 pence to 585 pence.
""East Midlands is the one most likely to face a bid, it is smaller than others and more purely a distribution company,"" Nigel Hawkins at brokers Yamaichi said.
A report in the Daily Telegraph newspaper also suggested that U.S. utility Duke Power might be circling the sector but no comment was available from either U.S. company.
Analysts said U.S. companies might not be the only ones interested in the sector, which has seen seven of the 12 Recs created at privatisation in 1990 fall prey to takeover bids.
The domestic supply business is to be opened to competition in 1998 and a range of companies from oil producers to supermarkets have already indicated an interest.
Other potential interest could come from water companies, analysts said, especially following Britain's decision on Friday to block planned bids for South West Water from Severn Trent and Wessex Water.
""You've got two disappointed companies there,"" said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull.
Analysts said Severn Trent could decide to use its resources to make a share buyback or a special dividend payout.
But Wessex Water may be enticed to link up with Southern Electric, analysts said, as multi-utilities have been approved.
Welsh Water took over Swalec to form Hyder while United Utilities combined North West Water and Norweb.
""The idea of multi-utilities is gaining ground,"" Whiting said.",0
"Privatised nuclear power generator British Energy Plc sparked criticism on Wednesday when it announced job cuts that failed to impress the stock market and angered unions.
""I don't think this move transforms (British Energy's) prospects at all,"" said Philip Hollobone, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe.
British Energy said in a statement it aimed to cut 1,460 jobs in Scotland and Wales to make savings in staff costs of 50 million pounds ($78 million) within three years.
It said it would have a one-off restructuring charge of 100 million pounds which was already provided for.
Chief executive Robert Hawley said there could be more savings to come as cuts in office costs came through.
Union representatives slammed the move in a statement as ""a high risk strategy,"" warning that job cuts could ""reduce training, lower standards and threaten safety.""
The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), part of Britain's Health and Safety Executive, said it would review the plans and take action if it felt safety would suffer.
""If we think (the plans) are adverse (for safety), we will use regulatory powers to stop (British Energy) doing them,"" a spokesman for the NII said.
But Hawley maintained that ""safety is our bottom line, not profit.""
British Energy's debut on the stock exchange in July was overshadowed by temporary closures of two of its eight reactors after cracks were discovered.
Shares kicked off below the partly-paid issue price of 105 pence to institutions and 100 pence to small investors and have rarely moved above those levels, mangaging just a half penny rise on the day on Wednesday to stand at 108 pence at 1130 GMT.
The ruling Conservative government pressed ahead with its privatisation despite the deep unpopularity of the deal and has been left with a stake of around 12 percent.
The opposition Labour Party also criticised the job cuts, which energy and industry spokesman John Battle said showed British Energy ""has not performed as they promised they would.""
He called on the company to confirm its dividend policy which it has said is vulnerable to underperformance by nuclear power stations.
Although Hawley maintained the company's plans were aimed at making ""absolutely sure we are competitive in the market place,"" analysts expressed concern it faced stiff challenges and remained an unattractive investment.
""They are under pressure,"" said Marshall Whiting of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull (SGST).
Whiting said the crucial factor for British Energy was price of electricity in the so-called ""pool,"" or wholesale market.
""Pressure on electricity prices is downward in the medium to long term. (British Energy) has to address operating costs to get profits to stand still,"" he said.
Hollobone said the cost cuts should make predictions for dividend growth more secure but added that these were still below market averages.
""Dividend growth is one of the lowest in the sector and there is no sign of a special dividend,"" he said.
British Energy said at its privatisation that the first interim dividend would be 4.6 pence a share and forecasts for final dividend are for 9.1 pence in 1996/97.",0
"Optus Communications Ltd said on Tuesday its Optus Vision pay-television venture was considering whether to continue to support the Australian Rugby League (ARL) after its court defeat against News Corp last week.
""The decision we have to make is how long we continue to support that, and I think right now our people and Channel Nine people would be talking about those issues,"" Optus Communications chairman Russell Fynmore told Reuters.
Fynmore did not elaborate but said the ultimate fate of the ARL or its News-backed rival Superleague would be decided by the financial backing for the leagues.
""This is really for the ARL and Superleague to determine and in the end it will determined on how much financial support there is for both leagues,"" Fynmore said.
Optus Vision, five percent-owned by Australian magnate Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd (PBL), owns the pay-television broadcast rights to the ARL. PBL's Channel Nine has the free-to-air broadcast rights to ARL.
The ARL suffered a major reversal of fortunes last Friday before the full bench of the Federal Court, which unanimously upheld News' appeal against previous rulings banning Superleague till the turn of the century.
Superleague is preparing to kick off its competition next season, creating the prospect of two rival leagues fighting for TV audience share in 1997 unless a compromise is reached.
Earlier on Tuesday, News Ltd executive chairman Ken Cowley said the company's door was open to talks with the ARL.
""You have always got to keep your door open...,"" Cowley told reporters in Melbourne.
""We want to maximise the number of fans watching Superleague and so we will be doing the best we can for the fans and the clubs and the players,"" he added.
He dismissed suggestions, published on Tuesday in News Ltd's The Australian newspaper, that ARL chairman Ken Arthurson could step aside to facilitate a merger of the two leagues.
""The statement by Ken suggesting he might fall on his sword is rather a curious reaction,"" Cowley said.
""He has no authority in the ARL -- he hasn't had for a couple of years. He cannot make any decisions of any consequences regarding to the game, and particularly to Superleague, without the approval of Kerry Packer.""",0
"The world's biggest mining house, RTZ Corp Plc-CRA Ltd, is set to report a sharp fall in annual profit this week after shouldering a slide in metal prices during the year and battling problems with its U.S. copper smelter, mining analysts said.
The group, which has operations spanning the globe, is on average expected to post a 26-percent fall in net profit before exceptional items to US$1.067 billion for calendar 1996, a Reuter survey of six Australian brokerages revealed.
RTZ-CRA, a dual-listed merger of British-based RTZ Plc and Australian-based CRA Ltd, is due to announce its earnings on Thursday. It made US$1.441 billion in 1995.
Australian analysts' forecasts range between US$1.04 billion and US$1.097 billion, although private forecasting service Barceps quoted much lower numbers in a survey last month.
The culprits behind RTZ-CRA's profit slump are seen as the copper price, which dipped below 90 U.S. cents a pound after the Sumitomo trading scandal erupted in June, a weak aluminium price and problems with the flagship Bingham Canyon copper smelter.
Together, copper and aluminium earned almost 41 percent of RTZ-CRA's total revenue in 1995, and metal prices were promising enough early in 1996 for the group to talk of higher earnings.
But metal prices caught a cold and the prospects of improved profits also began to look sick mid-year, when the Sumitomo Corp trading scandal sent international copper prices crashing.
Yasuo Hamanaka, a star trader who once dominated the copper market, has admitted charges of fraud and forgery and accepted blame for a scandal that cost Sumitomo $2.6 billion and devalued the copper inventories of metals companies around the world.
""Everything peaked ahead of this Hamanaka copper thing,"" said Peter O'Connor of Macquarie Bank.
""Most commodities slid from June on through to about September, October and there's been a bit of recovery in most metal prices since that time.""
RTZ-CRA's iron ore business was also a disappointment, one analyst said, noting that sales for the year dropped six percent despite a lift in annual output.
Adding salt to the wound, the gold price also languished. Gold is a sensitive area for the mining giant, since it is fundamentally opposed to selling its production forward at a fixed price to lock in revenue.
RTZ-CRA's coal mines are also not expected to have relieved some of the pain inflicted on the group by weak prices. One analyst expects coal earnings to fall 10 percent in 1996.
RTZ-CRA's troubled Bingham Canyon smelter in Utah has stirred the deepest concerns among analysts, who have been waiting for the new plant to get it right after 18 months of hobbled operation. The smelter is still not operating at full capacity and soon faces a six-week shut-down soon for major modifications.
Copper division earnings are forecast to plunge by some 40 percent, according to HSBC James Capel's forecast.
Still, the brokerage likes the group's long-term prospects, which include a copper mine in Chile and a copper and gold mine in Indonesia.
""They have a very, very strong organic growth profile,"" said HSBC James Capel analyst Umit Safak. ""They have very substantial expansions coming up,"" he added.",0
"Australian furniture, whitegoods and computer retailer Harvey Norman said on Wednesday it was trailing behind its target for 15 percent annual sales growth and that cool summer weather had impacted on December sales.
Managing director Michael Harvey told Reuters that December sales again grew by ""double digit figures"" on the same month a year ago, but was not matching the robust growth the expanding company traditionally enjoyed.
Excluding sales from new stores, turnover in December, a peak month, rose only about five percent, Harvey said.  
""We are looking for a 15 percent increase (in 1996/97), which will take us from A$1.043 billion, which we posted last financial year, up to A$1.2 billion and at the moment we are falling short of that target,"" Harvey said in an interview.
He described the retail trading environment as the worst in the company's 15-year history, but stuck to his earlier hope that the second half of the current year ending June 30 would compensate for a slow first half.  
Harvey declined to give a profit forecast but said the company was ""definitely not"" heading down the same path as retailers David Jones Ltd, Country Road Ltd and Just Jeans Ltd, all of which have announced steep interim profit downgrades.
""If we have a flat result or if we were indeed between flat and 10 percent down, we are going to be disappointed,"" he said.
""But I can assure you it's our belief that it won't be less than a 10 percent decrease on last year and it's certainly our hope that it will be an increase on last yeaer's profit result.
""But, again, because of the nature of our business, it's just too early to tell,"" he said.  
Harvey Norman reported a dip in net profit after abnormals of A$30.41 million in 1995/96, but told shareholders at its annual meeting in November it looked forward to strong summer months from November to February.
But managing director Harvey said summer had so far been unseasonally cool in its east-coast markets, dampening sales of goods like air conditioners, refrigerators, fans, outdoor furniture and barbecues.
""That's really let us down more than anything else,"" he said. December and January are usually the firm's peak months.  
Harvey Norman is still hoping for a heatwave, but hot weather has its biggest impact on sales before Christmas when a lot of discretionary household expenditure is spent, he added.
The company is also pinning its hopes on a turnaround in consumer spending in the first half of calendar 1997 to enable Harvey Norman to reach its 15 percent sales target, but Harvey said there appeared to be little joy on the immediate horizon.
""Through last year we were basically saying it's got to turn in the second quarter of '97 calendar year, but at moment there's nothing to indicate that's going to happen...,"" he said.  
""My view is that next financial year starting July it will be a better year than this year and last year, but in terms of when it will actually start to turn, we are hoping...it will be the second quarter,"" Harvey said.
""I don't think we are going to see much joy in January, February, but it's our hope that things will turn come March, April, May, June,"" he said.",0
"Australian-based Foster's Brewing Group Ltd reported on Monday a small rise in interim net profit, but the bottom line result hid a strong performance from the group's home brews.
Foster's posted a 2.4 percent increase in net earnings to A$169.4 million, after booking a A$5.6 million abnormal loss.
The loss was due mainly to ongoing restructuring costs of the group's 40 percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, and concealed a 10 percent rise in pre-abnormal net earnings to A$168 million.  
Foster's chief executive Ted Kunkel largely attributed the rise in pre-abnormal earnings to a ""sparkling"" performance from the group's domestic powerhouse, Carlton and United Breweries (CUB), in the six months to December 31.
""CUB had a four percent increase in the volume of beer sold, a remarkable result in a beer market which rose only 0.6 percent,"" he said in a statement.
CUB, which has taken a commanding market lead in Australia over chief rival Lion Nathan, contributed A$187.4 million in earnings before interest and tax, a rise of 11.5 percent over the first half of 1995/96 (July/June).  
The group result came in at slightly below the average forecast for first-half profit of around A$170 million.
The share price dipped a few cents after the announcement, but a Sydney broker said the stock was also moving to the tune of speculation Foster's may buy back the 37 percent stake held by resources giant The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd.
BHP indicated on Sunday it was in no hurry to sell its Foster's investment. Foster's shares were trading at A$2.60 at 0325 GMT (14.20 p.m.), down five cents on Friday's close.  
Foster's said it expected earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to be higher in the year to June 30 than the A$371 million reported in 1995/96, but that interest costs and the re-emergence of tax liability on Australian income would have an impact on the overall earnings for the 1996/97 year.
But Foster's said losses at its brewing operation in China widened in the six months ended December 31, 1996.
Foster's said its China operations recorded a loss before interest and tax of A$10.2 million in the first half compared with a loss of A$6.8 million in the 1995/96 first half.  
It said revenues in China for the half rose to A$20.9 million up from A$15.9 million a year earlier, with volumes sold rising to 539,000 hectolitres compared with 392,000 hectolitres.
Foster's wine unit, Mildara Blass, contributed A$33.4 million in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) on sales of A$115.5 million, while its Rothbury Wines acquisition, completed in July 1996, was on track to achieved targeted first year earnings growth.",0
"Global paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd announced on Monday a rare slide in annual profit, blaming weak world paper prices and flat economic growth at home, but its shares held firm on the promise of recovery.
The result, which was Amcor's first fall in pre-abnormal profit in over a decade, failed to rock the blue-chip's battered share price, which had already fallen heavily in the past six months in anticipation of a weak outcome.  
""Potentially, the worst is over and you are looking forward to increased earnings here on in,"" a Sydney-based broker told Reuters after Amcor reported a six percent drop in net profit to A$338.8 million in the year to June 30.
Amcor's paper division was hit by a roughly 20 percent fall in world paper prices since late calendar 1995, and weak economic activity in Australia and Germany impacted heavily on its packaging operations, the company said.
But Amcor suggested that paper prices had bottomed out and said it hoped to see signs of an upturn in 1997.  
""Paper prices ... appear to have bottomed, all Amcor businesses have restructuring and cost-reduction programmes underway and there are new business opportunities in all regions,"" Amcor managing director Don Macfarlane told reporters.
The stock market, which shaved over A$2.00 off Amcor's year-high share price this year, initially pushed the shares higher on Monday before late selling pulled them to a close of A$7.62, down 12 cents on Friday's close, in a falling market.
""I don't think sentiment towards the stock is going to change in the near term,"" said one Melbourne-based analyst.  
""Profit will be flat towards the end of the (current 1996/97) year and then start to pick up into the new year,"" she added, predicting that a recovery in Australian economic growth will begin to spur Amcor's earnings in 1997/98.
Amcor, one of the world's top-10 paper and packaging companies and for many years a favourite of the local bourse, signalled a major cost-cutting drive and a reduction in capital expenditure to restore margins, especially in packaging.  
The packaging business, which makes products ranging from plastic beverage bottles and breakfast-cereal boxes to carboard boxes, suffered squeezed profit margins in Australia and New Zealand, and poor results in Germany.
Its Holfeder box-making business in Germany posted another undisclosed loss in 1996/97. ""The level of confidence in the German economy is abysmal,"" Amcor's Macfarlane said.
The group's U.S. operations also ""dragged its feet"" but its British packaging business posted excellent results, he said.  
Amcor's Asian packaging operations posted higher profit, despite paper prices in the region ""sinking like a stone"" this year and dragging carboard-box prices with them, he said.
""It's been a rollar-coaster ride on paper prices in Asia,"" he added.
Amcor has long had a target of achieving 15 percent growth in earnings per share, but Macfarlane announced this annual goal had been scrapped, given the difficult trading environment and Australia's new low-inflation environment.
""I think we simply have to for a period pull them (rapid-growth ambitions) down a peg or two...,"" he said.  
""Clearly we have to make sure that the businesses we have already got are earning reasonable returns.""",0
"Australia's biggest aluminium producer, Comalco Ltd, plunged into the red on Monday, blaming weak prices, a strong local dollar and higher smelting costs.
Comalco announced a loss of A$16.8 million (US$12.9 million) in calendar 1996, compared with a net profit after abnormals of A$232.3 million in 1995.
Before abnormals, 1996 earnings were in line with market expectations at A$32.9 million, a fraction of the 1995 result.
The result made only a brief dent in Comalco's share price, which was battered in recent months in anticipation of a slide in earnings. The shares fell eight cents on the news, but rebounded to end at A$6.88, up six cents from Friday's close.
Comalco is owned 67 percent by global mining group RTZ-CRA, due to report its annual profit on Thursday.
""The market has pretty much factored in the loss and is now focusing on future earnings prospects,"" one share trader said.
As expected, Comalco's smelting division played a part in the earnings nose-dive. It made a loss for the year, but this paled in comparison with the damage done to Comalco's earnings by the slump in aluminium prices and a strong local currency.
""The 1996 result was severely impacted by lower prices,"" chief executive Terry Palmer told reporters in Melbourne.
The London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminium price averaged 70 U.S. cents a pound in 1996, compared with an average of 83 cents in 1995, the company said. The Australian dollar averaged 78 U.S. cents in 1996, four cents stronger than in 1995, it added.
Comalco's premiums over the LME price also suffered. Together, the aluminium market and the local dollar pared a total of about A$201 from operating profit, overwhelming a rise in total production volumes, the company said.
But Palmer painted a much brighter outlook, assuring investors that Comalco's aluminium production is set to climb and predicting a stronger aluminium price over 1997.
Comalco saw firming global demand for the metal this year, fuelled by economic recovery in Europe and continued growth in the United States. ""Consumption in Asia is not expected to grow in 1997,"" the company said.
Comalco also denied market speculation it might sell off its smelters and abandon its plan to build a A$1 billion alumina refinery in either Queensland state or Sarawak, Malaysia. Alumina, produced from bauxite, is the raw material for making aluminium.
""The current talk about that (withdrawing from smelting) is one hell of a way wide of the mark,"" Palmer said.
""The position with the alumina project remains unchanged,"" he added.
Comalco hopes to start building the refinery, with annual capacity of one million to 1.5 million tonnes, in 1998. Site selection will depend heavily on the kind of power contracts Queensland and Malaysia can offer, Palmer said.",0
"Australia's century-old steel maker, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), has been warned it risks falling behind global rivals unless it restructures its big, ageing plants and maps out a clear offshore strategy.
BHP Steel's long-term strategy came under the spotlight on Monday after credit rating agency Standard and Poor's wrote in a steel industry review that BHP faced its toughest test yet as it positioned itself to tackle rapidly developing Asian markets.
S&P's comments, made in the latest edition of its journal CreditFocus, comes as Taiwan's An Feng Steel Co Ltd plans to build a A$1.4 billion steel mill in Australia in what has been termed a ""wake-up call"" for BHP.
""A wake-up call is not a bad way of looking at it,"" a corporate analyst told Reuters, describing the competition to supply steel into Asian economies as intense.
""It's not that they (BHP) have been flat-footed; it's just that there are (bigger) global players out there with billions of dollars to set these things up,"" he added.
An Feng and its little known minority Australian partner, Kingstream Resources NL, launched last Friday a plan to build a new-technology steel mill expected to produce annually 2.4 million tonnes of steel slab for mainly Asian consumption.
The move has been seen as a direct challenge to BHP, which dominates the Australian market with steel products made from old-technology plants on the country's east and south coasts. The youngest of its three big steel mills opened 56 years ago. These old mills also supply raw steel for BHP's more modern offshore operations, which have so far focused on downstream steel mills in Asia making higher-value products tailored for such industries as car-making and construction.
BHP produces 636 tonnes of steel per worker per year using predominantly coal-fired blast furnaces, but by the year 2000 new-technology mills using electric arc furnaces will enable steel operators to reach 1,000 tonnes per worker, S&P said.
""In many respects, BHP Steel's future earnings quality will depend on the successful implementation of this international growth strategy and the critical selection of steel-making technology for future domestic expansion,"" S&P analyst Brad Scott wrote in the January edition of CreditFocus.
BHP is expected by May to announce the results of a year-long review of the steel division's long-term strategy, begun last year after the group reported a dive in steel profits and a big writedown of its Newcastle mill near Sydney.
BHP has since indicated it is prepared to close the 81-year-old Newcastle mill if need be.
Speculation about the closure of Newcastle, and with it the loss of thousands of jobs, has prompted a parliamentary inquiry into the future of Australia's steel industry -- virtually a synonym for BHP, which supplies 75 percent of the local market.
BHP's local dominance and its production costs, still low in global terms, will give it some comfort over the next few years, but the so-called ""Big Australian"" must rationalise its assets at home to realise its long-term goals in Asia, analysts said.
""BHP will need to define its domestic investment vision over that period or risk falling behind the competitiveness of its global competitors,"" S&P's Scott said.
A stock analyst suggested BHP may even resolve to abandon raw-steel making capacity and begin buying it instead from cheaper producers, but a BHP Steel spokesman doubted this.
""I would not see that,"" spokesman John Devers told Reuters. ""We have got the benefits of relatively low-cost raw materials on our doorstep and good transport arrangements and energy.""",0
"Australian resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co (BHP) posted a 9.8-percent fall in first-half profits on Friday, disappointing the share market but avoiding another mauling by investors.
BHP, whose shares have been hammered since its key markets in steel and copper turned sour six months ago, posted a A$790 million (US$628 million) net profit for the six months to November 30, down from A$867 for the same period last year.
But Australia's largest quoted company had its bottom line boosted by an abnormal gain of A$107 million and investors were initially not impressed.
The share price were up 54 cents to a high of A$17.59 just after the result then took a tumble and settled at around A$17.20 in early afternoon trading.
But late buying across the board helped BHP, the market bellwether stock, recover ground and the stock closed at A$17.48, 43 three cents higher than Thursday's close.
""It's pretty lousy,"" one fund manager's stock analyst told Reuters soon after the release. Another analyst disappointed with the result said the resources giant was still on track for a modest profit recovery for the full year to May 31, 1997.
Though forecast signs of improvement emerged in BHP's battered copper division, with the North American copper operations swinging back into profit, analysts had been tipping a first-half group pre-abnormal result of around A$760 million.
BHP's pre-abnormal net profit of A$683 million was 15.8 percent down on the corresponding 1995/96 period.
But managing director John Prescott said the second quarter figures showed an accelerating improvement in performance and that, despite weak copper and steel prices, the group was still investing in future growth.
Citing a sharp jump in exploration expenditure in the half year, he told reporters: ""That's an important part of sustaining our growth.""
""I think we are moving ahead,"" he added. ""We have a lot of work to do and we're going to build the company around its high-quality assets and we are starting to see the results of our work.""
Including abnormals, BHP's minerals, copper and steel divisions all contributed higher earnings in the latest three months against the August quarter. The steel division was flat.
Petroleum was the biggest earner with A$253 million for the quarter, but this included an abnormal gain of A$107 million from the settlement of a dispute over a gas resource tax.
BHP Petroleum's pre-abormal result also included a A$82 million windfall from asset sales and a larger than expected exploration expense.
BHP's minerals division, a major world producer of iron ore and coal, doubled its contribution to profit in the second quarter to A$154 million, due largely to higher world prices.
BHP Copper benefitted from a recent firming in the copper price and a cut of seven U.S. cents per pound in its North American operating costs to post a second quarter profit of A$132 million, up from A$85 million in the first quarter.
The U.S. copper operations, acquired last January with the US$2.4 billion purchase of Magma Copper, made a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter. Prescott said on Friday Magma had swung back into profit in the second quarter.
BHP Steel's second-quarter profit was flat at A$90 million.",0
"Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, reported on Wednesday a firm rise in sales revenue, signalling the worst may be over for the country's struggling merchants.
Coles announced a 5.4 percent rise in sales revenue to A$9.9 billion for the six months to January 26, sounding a rare note of optimism in an industry that has been hit hard by a downturn in consumer spending.  
Coles, which pockets almost 18 cents in every retail dollar spent in Australia, attributed the result to good management rather than any pick-up in the economy.
""A lot of people have done a lot of work to get where we needed to get,"" Coles chief executive Dennis Eck told Reuters.
But Coles' sale announcement came after another retailer, David Jones Ltd, reassessed its profit outlook, painting a slighter brighter picture than the bleak dive in earnings it forecast just after Christmas.  
David Jones, an upmarket department store chain, had told the Australian Stock Exchange early last month it feared a 50 percent fall in interim profit, but changed its mind this week.
""It will not be as bad as that,"" David Jones chief executive Chris Tideman told Reuters on Tuesday.
He did not elaborate but stock analysts said on Wednesday post-Christmas clearance sales helped lift the company's overall sales result for the first half year to January 25 to A$783 million, only one percent lower than a year ago.  
""I think we have probably gone through the worst in spending, but I would not expect a dramatically big turnaround,"" said retail analyst Simon Shakesheff, of Macquarie Bank.
""The sentiment is still a bit fragile, but at the end of the day, until there's a bit more job creation out there, people are not going to be spending more,"" he added.
Another Sydney-based analyst agreed that consumers' wallets would be slow to open.
""I think we will (see a recovery) but I don't think we saw it in January,"" the analyst said.  
Australian retail sales are at their lowest ebb since the nation's official statistician began counting them 35 years ago. They have fallen in trend terms in each of the past five months.
Employment has also been weak with Australia's jobless rate hovering at 8.6 percent.
Coles confirmed on Wednesday that trading conditions were still tough, especially in the areas of clothing and fashion where its only specialist apparel chain, Katies, reported a 4.7 percent drop in retail sales for the second quarter.  
But Coles' Eck said profit margins in its underperforming department store chains were improving, as store managers improved the quality of merchandise sold and pared back costs.
In sharp contrast to the group's 33.8 percent fall in net profit in 1995/96, Eck said he expected an increase in bottom-line earnings for the current year ending July 27.
""Our earnings are in line with our plan,"" he said.
Coles reported net profit of A$280 million in 1995/96, and stock analysts are forecasting a modest profit rise in 1996/97.",0
"Institutional investor National Mutual Holdings Ltd has arranged to meet St George Bank Ltd to discuss its merger with Advance Bank Australia Ltd in a sign of growing disquiet over the deal.
National Mutual's funds management arm, a top-20 shareholder in St George, wants to discuss the bank's decision not to put the merger proposal to a shareholders' vote.  
""We are coming close to having a position on that and we are meeting shortly with St George and we will make some decision at the end of the meeting,"" said National Mutual Funds Management Ltd's domestic equity investments manager, Paul Jennings.
He declined to comment further but market sources said on Monday that National Mutual and at least one other institution were lobbying St George to reverse it decision not to seek shareholder approval for the A$2.65 billion merger.
""Three institutions ... are a little bit up in arms about it and would like to see a meeting,"" a broker said.  
National Australia Bank Ltd, itself seen as a predator in Australia's rapidly consolidating banking sector, has already said it is disappointed at St George's decision, which has been approved by the Australian Stock Exchange.
""We are disappointed there would not be a shareholders' meeting and we were concerned about the level of information out there about a merger proposal,"" NAB spokesman David Upton said.
""Given there hasn't been any details of the merger released as yet, we thought it would be important to have a meeting to give shareholders an opportunity to discuss it and find out more,"" Upton said.  
He declined to comment when asked about a newspaper comment that NAB might have few legal options to oppose the bid.
""We simply wanted to make known that we were disappointed that there wouldn't be a meeting,"" he said.
St George's scrip and cash offer valued each Advance Bank share at A$7.30 -- or nearly three times net asset backing.
The Australian Shareholders' Association, representing small shareholders, said it had met St George last Friday over the question of a shareholders' meeting.
""We are not at all happy,"" association executive officer Tony McLean told Reuters.  
""The principle is that it's a very significant deal for the bank and we believe that shareholders should be involved in approving it,"" he added.
He declined to comment on his talks with St George but said: ""There will be an exchange of information between ourselves and the bank."" McLean declined to elaborate.
Asked if an extraordinary general meeting could be called to pressure St George into reversing its decision, he said: ""I guess that's a possibility.""",0
"Australia's biggest aluminium producer, Comalco Ltd, plunged heavily into the red on Monday, blaming its loss for calendar 1996 on weak aluminium prices, an adverse exchange rate and higher smelting costs.
Comalco's net profit before abnormals slid to A$32.9 million in 1996 from A$264.8 million in 1995, in line with expectations, but abnormals dragged the bottom line to a A$16.8 million loss.
The result made a small dent in the stock's share price, which dropped eight cents on the news but recovered by 0125 GMT (12.25 p.m.) to A$6.80, down only two cents from Friday's close.  
Comalco is owned 67 percent by global mining group RTZ-CRA.
""The market has pretty much factored in the loss and is now focusing on future earnings prospects,"" a Brisbane dealer said.
As expected, Comalco's smelting division played a part in the earnings nose-dive.
Higher operating costs at its three smelters shaved A$32 million from group operating profit, Comalco said. It blamed this on higher prices for raw materials like fuel, power and coke, and on costs associated with smelter upgrades and expansions.",0
"Australian paper and packaging group Amcor Ltd is expected on Monday to post a heavy slump in annual profit, due to lower paper prices and weak demand in its home market, but analysts feel the worst may soon be over.
The group, which recently warned the stock market its 1995/96 (July/June) results would be down on its 1994/95 record net profit, is tipped to announce a fall of around eight percent in pre-abnormal net earnings.  
Stock analysts are forecasting on average a result of A$372 million pre-abnormal profit in 1995/96, according to BZW Investment Management's BARCEPS forecasting service.
But Amcor, which is highly sensitive to both world paper prices and the Australian economic cycle, is coming off a record year in 1994/95, when a surge in paper prices and a strong local economy lifted the bottom line by 40 percent to A$359.7 million.
In the first half of 1995/96, prices turned against the group, which relies for 45 percent of its turnover on white paper sales, and the domestic economy has remained flat.  
Prices have fallen in the order of about 30 percent since their peak in late calendar 1995, one paper market source said.
In a sign of the times, Amcor's 46-percent-owned paper merchant Spicers Paper Ltd reported last Monday a 35 percent slide in annual net profit to A$16.02 million.
""There's been some pretty tough markets there and I think the Australian economy is flat and the paper cycle has gone against them a bit,"" said Brisbane-based analyst John Clifford, of Morgan Stockbroking Ltd.  
Sales are expected to exceed last year's A$6.6 billion, but margins have been squeezed and are likely to remain tight through at least the first half of 1996/97, the analysts said.
But Clifford and a Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters they saw pre-abnormal net profit stabilising at around A$400 million in 1996/97 and recovering the next year.
""As soon as there is some sort of pick-up in economic growth, you will see it start to improve,"" the Melbourne-based analyst told Reuters on Thursday.
""I am positive in the longer term,"" she added.  
Amcor, one of the world's top ten paper and packaging groups, has paper packaging operations in Europe, the United States, Asia and New Zealand. It has maintained double-digit growth in net profit for all but four of the past five years.
Despite the current downturn, it has continued to expand its offshore operations, buying 51 percent of Belgian UCB SA's flexible packing unit in May for about A$200 million.
It has also allocated A$380 million to expand paper production in Australia, where it commands about 40 percent of the market for fine papers.  
Morgan's Clifford said he believed these and other capital investments -- totalling A$1.5 billion over the past two and a half years -- would begin to bolster the bottom line in 1997/98.
""These sorts of programmes will certainly come through with increased profits through 1998 (1997/98) and especially through 1999 (1998/99),"" Clifford said.
""The four to five-year outlook is pretty strong,"" he added.",0
"Australian retailers are heading for a grim round of sharply lower profit results as one by one the major chains announce they have fallen casualty to a sluggish economy and tight-fisted consumers.
Homeware retailer Harvey Norman Ltd added its voice on Wednesday to the chorus of woe, revealing it was trailing its goal of 15 percent annual sales growth amid the worst retail environment in the company's 15-year history.  
The comments, made to Reuters in an interview, follow formal warnings to the stock exchange that big upmarket department store chain David Jones Ltd, and two large clothing retailers, expect steep profit slides.
David Jones and fashion houses Country Road Ltd and Just Jeans Ltd have all warned of 50 percent drops in interim profit for the half-year ending January, confirming that Christmas failed to boost retailers' bottom lines.  
""We are used to posting massive increases (in sales turnover) year after year after year. This is the first year we've ever been caught up in a general market malaise,"" said Harvey Norman managing director Michael Harvey.
""It's basically an indication to us that the market is having its worst year since Harvey Norman began (in 1982).""
Harvey Norman, which is aiming for turnover of A$1.2 billion in the year ending June 30, has enjoyed annual sales growth of up to 58 percent over the past four years.  
It, along with other retailers, had been hoping for a strong December but found Australian wallets were not as easy to prise open as they once were, especially for clothes.
Australia's biggest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, which accounts for almost 18 cents in every retail dollar spent, declined on Wednesday to give figures for December sales.
But corporate affairs director Peter Morgan said he was ""comfortable"" with Coles' performance. Coles has recently been among the most poorly performed listed retailers and is embarking on a major refocusing of its sprawling businesses.  
Official data released on Tuesday showed that all areas of retailing except for food weakened in the three months to November and that overall retail sales continued to trend down despite two interest rate cuts since July.
The Reserve Bank eased rates again last month, but it was too late to rescue a second dismal Christmas for retailers.
""A shocker"" was how one stock analyst summed up the festive season for the clothing retailers, but she said supermarket chain Woolworths Ltd and other food retailers should have come through the Christmas period relatively unscathed.  
Asked about the outlook for full-year profits in 1996/97, the analyst said: ""Pretty grim."" But she and another analyst said they saw a pick-up in earnings in coming months.
""I think the outlook is reasonable, but not spectacular,"" the second analyst said.",0
"Resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd is expected to report a fall in half year net profit on Friday, but share analysts say Australia's biggest company is likely to be spared another stock market mauling.
BHP, still licking its wounds with sellers having wiped around A$5 billion off its market value since May, is tipped to post a first-half net profit of around A$760 million, down from A$811 million a year ago, according to analysts' forecasts.  
The result, for the six months to November 30, is expected to include roughly A$100 million in net proceeds from asset sales, but slight improvements in the battered copper and steel divisions are also likely to emerge, the analysts said.
BHP's share price, which hit a year high of A$20.05 in early May, has been on a mostly downward roller-coaster ride for the past six months as copper and steel prices turned sour, and analysts revised down their near-term profit forecasts.  
But the copper price has firmed in recent months, steel markets are thought to have bottomed, and brokerages are again reworking their outlooks. BHP shares have also rebounded, closing on Monday at A$17.31 after hitting A$15.58 in September.
""It's one of the few companies where analysts are revising the results upwards,"" said a fund manager's share analyst.
The five analysts contacted by Reuters on Monday gave widely varying forecasts for interim profit, ranging from A$715 million to a high of A$804 million. The analyst tipping A$715 million said he believed others had forecast even lower numbers.  
But the analysts agreed the interim result would show signs of improved performance in copper and steel, though they would fine tune their estimates after seeing the group's November production data, expected to be released on Tuesday.
""They have definitely had a good two quarters in petroleum and I guess they're struggling in minerals and copper and steel,"" a Melbourne-based analyst said.
""They are doing a good job given the environment.""
Most analysts said they expected a modest profit recovery for full year 1996/97. BHP reported a 20 percent drop in pre-abnormal net profit of A$1.29 billion in 1995/96.  
BHP Petroleum, which in the first half of 1995/96 ranked behind the minerals and steel divisions in terms of profit, will be BHP's biggest earner in the interim result to be released on Friday, said JB Were and Son analyst Neil Goodwill.
""The asset sales are in there though,"" he said.
The analysts expect BHP to book between A$80 million and A$117 million in asset sales as operating profit, due in effect to gains on the sale of BHP's stake in the Mungo/Monan oil and gas fields in the North Sea and of its interest in the Sierra Chata gas field and Chihuidos block in Argentina.  
BHP also made a A$45 million profit from the sale of its 20 percent stake in an undeveloped gold prospect, Sun Prospecting and Mining Co Ltd, in South Africa. But this was offset by the A$45 million loss booked on the sale of its Mali gold assets.
BHP will not book any of these asset sales as abnormal items, deeming them too small to be taken below the line, one analyst said. But another analyst confessed he initially felt they were being taken above the line to mask the core result.  
""I thought that was the case and then the oil price shot up and copper is a bit better, so without that number (for asset sales) they would have had a reasonably good profit number anyway,"" he said.
BHP's Magma Copper operation should creep back into profit in the second quarter after posting a loss on a full-cost basis in the first quarter results, he said.
BHP bought Magma last January for US$2.4 billion, making it the world's second biggest copper producer. But the price tag has come under heavy criticism.  
BHP is expected to book a net abnormal gain of around A$100 million from the settlement of its dispute with the Victoria state government over a federal tax on Bass Strait gas revenues.",0
"Australian casino company Crown Ltd said on Tuesday its earnings were likely to suffer due to lost time at its new casino complex in Melbourne.
Crown, which has seen its share price fall as doubts emerge over its profit outlook, confirmed that a recent heatwave forced workers at the site to down tools for a number of days.
""I don't think we have made a calculation yet on what effect it will have on the bottom line, but it's something you don't need in this part of the project,"" Crown spokesman Gary O'Neill said. ""I think it will (impact profit),"" he added.  
Crown had planned to open its new A$1.6 billion casino, hotel and shopping complex in Melbourne in March. It is now aiming for late April and maybe even May, O'Neill told Reuters.
""We are still hoping to open towards the end of April...but things like this don't help obviously and it could have a small effect on the bottom line. It could put the open date back to May,"" he said.
O'Neill was commenting on a newspaper report which said members of the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) stopped work 10 times this month as the temperature topped 35 degrees Celcius.  
""There were 10 days when the temperature was over 35 degrees, but I don't think we lost all of that time,"" O'Neill said. ""I think we lost a number of working days.""
Crown also rejected a bearish earnings forecast made by accountants Ernst and Young.
The forecast was cited in an  independent report sent to Crown shareholders recently.
It quotes Ernst and Young as forecasting basic earnings per share of 3.76 cents in 1997/98 (July-June), compared with brokers' average forecast of 14.8 cents for the same year.  
The brokers' forecast was based on a mean pre-abnormal net profit of A$87.5 million for 1997/98, according to Barceps forecasting service. Crown reported net profit after abnormals of A$58.38 million in 1995/96.
""We obviously don't agree with it (the Ernst and Young forecast),"" O'Neill said.
""Right at the moment, it's a very highly speculative period of time. It's just prior to our opening and people are tending to jump at shadows a little bit,"" he added.  
Crown's share price has fallen steeply over the past month. It stood at A$2.45 at 0300 GMT (2.00 p.m.) on Tuesday, down from its closing high so far this year of A$2.76 on January 22 and its 12 month high at A$3.06.
Crown is owned 30.9 percent by Hudson Conway Ltd, the operator of Crown casino at its existing premises. Hudson Conway also has options to buy 74.5 million new shares in Crown.
Crown is currently negotiating to buy back the casino management rights from Hudson Conway.",0
"Base-metals producer Pasminco Ltd forecast on Tuesday another tough year of cost-cutting, warning that a weak zinc market and a strong Australian dollar would make its last annual profit hard to beat.
""We are going to have a difficult year,"" chief executive David Stewart told reporters after delivering a subdued earnings outlook to shareholders at the group's annual meeting here.
Pasminco surprised financial markets markets in August by reporting a tripling of net profit to A$41 million for the year to June 30, despite weak prices for its major product, zinc.  
World zinc prices have not moved dramatically since then, but a stronger Australian dollar has made a major impact, dragging first quarter profit for 1996/97 lower, Stewart said.
""In the first quarter, our result...is below last year because of the impact of the (Australian) dollar,"" he said.
For every one-cent rise in the value of the Australian dollar against the greenback, Pasminco suffers a A$7.5 million fall in after-tax profit, Stewart said.
The local dollar on average was five cents stronger in the first quarter than its average throughout 1995/96, he added.",0
"Diversified manufacturer Pacific BBA Ltd said on Tuesday trading conditions in the second half of calendar 1996 had been softer than expected and it now expected 1996 profits to be around the same level as 1995.
""I've only seen July's results and verbal figures for August, but it will depend on how the rest of the year unfolds,"" Pacific BBA managing director Barry Jackson told Reuters.
""It's looking a bit softer than we would like. We were really budgetting for an economy that was stretching a touch but it doesn't look like it's going to do it,"" Jackson said.  
Jackson said in an interview the 1996 profit would be similar to calendar 1995's net profit of A$15.9 million.
""I think it's going to be much the same figure,"" he said.
Jackson cited the flat Australian economy, relatively weak automotive sales world-wide and the cost of developing new projects as the major constraints on short-term profit growth.
But he said the domestic economy should pick up in 1997 and put the group on track to achieving its goal of 15 to 20 percent annual growth in sales and earnings before interest and tax.  
But Jackson, speaking after the announcement of a A$200 million, five-year contract to supply brake parts to a North American vehicle manufacturer, seemed to be more concerned about coping with rapid growth than with a sluggish local economy.
Pacific BBA, which makes car parts, plastic packaging and construction products, has budgeted to spend around A$60 million in 1996 in capital expenditure, Jackson said.
""I think it (capital expenditure) will be two to three times depreciation (charges) for the next year or so,"" he said, adding that this was around twice the average for manufacturers.  
The group is examining a range of expansion opportunities in Asia and North America, requiring annual capital investments of between as little as A$5 million and A$200 million.
""We have people looking full time at these opportunities,"" he said. But the group must expand cautiously, he added.
""We've just got to be careful we don't over-stretch ourselves,"" he said. ""Growth holds back your short-term earnings,"" he added.
Jackson rued the failure of Pacific BBA's recent bid for fellow Australian manufacturer Azon Ltd, which was acquired instead by U.S.-based Illinois Tool Works Inc.  
Pacific BBA needs to become bigger or find a big partner to seize major new opportunities, especially in the automotive industry where the group wants to become a global niche player, he said.
Asked if its small size in world terms could become a brake on Pacific BBA's growth, Jackson said: ""It's not been yet, but it could become one and we were trying to say to the market when we were trying to buy Azon that this could give us the ability to do anything we want to.""",0
"Australia's Foster's Brewing Group Ltd said on Monday it was thirsty for expansion and eyeing possible joint ventures in India and Vietnam to add to its international stable of breweries.
Foster's executives told shareholders at the group's annual meeting in Melbourne that despite hiccups at its Canadian and Chinese operations, the company was well positioned to seize on growth opportunities both offshore and at home.
""The first priority after satisfying the cash needs of the current businesses is to seek out new direct investment opportunities with the right return profile,"" Foster's chief executive Ted Kunkel told the meeting.
""Should that not fully utilise the available financial resources, then we would look at additional options,"" he said.
Later, Foster's chairman John Ralph confirmed the group was considering joint venture breweries in Vietnam and India but said it was looking at a wide range of possible investments, including acquisitions. Asia is a major focus, he added.
He declined to give details but said the Vietnamese opportunity involved an existing plant.
""There's nothing immediate but we are looking across all the areas of our business in fact,"" Ralph told reporters.
""We are involved in looking at a couple of opportunities, but it's early days. Provided we can see it makes sense for us, and we can do it on a basis that's going to earn a satisfactory return, then we are likely to move,"" he said.
Foster's, which has breweries in Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangdong in China, said the Chinese operations would break even or turn a profit in 1998/99. Foster's China posted a 1995/96 loss of A$17 million (US$13 million) before interest and tax.
The group's 40-percent owned Canadian brewer, Molson Breweries, also performed weakly in its business year ending April 1, but has undergone a major restructure and is focusing on building market share at home, Foster's said.
Foster's chief executive Kunkel said Molson still delivered a high return on invested capital and forecast higher operating profits from the group's powerhouse Australian brewing unit, Carlton and United Breweries, over the medium term.
Foster's also plans to free up about A$400 million in non-performing assets and is counting on higher returns from its British pub chain, the Inntrepreneur Pub Company Ltd, putting the group in a stong position to pursue growth, Kunkel said.
Kunkel identified Asia as the most attractive region for investment, noting beer volumes there surged 60 percent in the first half of the 1990s and were forecast to rise another 40 percent before the turn of the century.
""Access can be achieved at a sufficiently low cost and the return profile is sufficiently better therefore than in other growing markets such as South America,"" he said.
Foster's has allocated A$200 million for direct investments in Asian markets, deeming this amount a ""prudent exposure"".
The group has spent four years shedding unwanted assets, lightening the burden of debt accumulated in the 1980s when it was part of the sprawling conglomerate known as Elders-IXL Ltd.
Foster's sold its British brewing unit, Courage, last year as part of this asset-sale programme. It has since bought two Australian wine-makers, Mildara Blass and Rothbury Wines Ltd.
""The restructuring of the last four years is nearly over,"" he said. ""Where there is more, it will present opportunities for profit.""
Foster's is on track to better its 1995/96 net profit of A$293.3 million in 1996/97, despite higher interest charges and tax payments in the current year, chairman Ralph said.",0
"A former chief executive of Australian retail giant Coles Myer Ltd spent millions of dollars of the company's money to renovate his home in a case of 1980s greed and excess, a court heard on Monday.
Brian Quinn, 60, who rose from a junior store assistant to run the country's biggest retailer, went on trial on Monday in the Victoria Supreme Court on a charge of conspiracy to defraud.
Quinn has pleaded not guilty and suggests he was set up.
The prosecution said on Monday that Quinn conspired to spend around A$4.0 million (US$3.0 million) of the group's money on renovations to his Melbourne home from 1982 to 1988, expanding and renovating it and building a tennis court, spa and pergola.
Prosecutor Paul Coghlan accused Quinn of excess, saying one room was painted 10 times, the house was extended by 70 square metres (80 square yards) and the land was levelled using a rock crusher and surrounded by a double-brick fence.
""This is a case...about excess in money wasting, excess as to how much work was down, excess as to the materials used, excess as to the hours spent,"" Coghlan told the jury.
""But most of all it's a case about greed. It's a case about having your employer paying for your excesses,"" he added.
The prosecution said Quinn and another former Coles manager, Graham Lanyon, conspired to ensure Coles paid the bills by pretending the work was being done on stores owned by Coles.
""The expenses were largely concealed from his employer, who was meeting the cost,"" Coghlan said.
Lanyon, as chief of the company's maintenance department, falsified invoices to conceal the fraud but ""he did so in collusion with, or on the orders of, the accused man"", he added.
But defence lawyer Philip Dunn said Quinn was the victim of a corrupt maintenance department headed by Lanyon and corrupt works contractors. Both concealed costs from Quinn who agreed in 1988 to partly reimburse the company, he told the jury.
""He is as much a victim as the company is,"" Dunn said.
Quinn's home belonged to Coles until 1985, when he bought it for what prosecutors estimate was about half market value. Prosecutors said that even while Coles owned the house, the work was done without board approval.
""Brian Quinn is charged with stealing from his employer whilst he was living in a company house, which indicates how much of a nonsense and a load of rubbish we believe this case is,"" Dunn told the jury.
The trial is expected to last eight weeks.",0
"Australia's biggest company, resources and steel group The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), said on Friday it has agreed to pay its domestic steel workers a 10 percent pay rise over two years.
The Australian Workers Union (AWU), which claims to represent about 80 percent of BHP Steel's 15,000 unionised steel workers, also confirmed the deal, saying it was struck and endorsed by the workforce just before Christmas.  
BHP and the AWU said the annual wage rises, effective from New Year's Day, were for five percent in calendar 1997 and five percent in 1998, paid as three percent instalments in January and two percent in July.
The wage rises include site-specific productivity offsets at steel mills around the country, but also included an adjustment for inflation and took into account other steel industry wage agreements, AWU spokesmen told Reuters.  
""These increases are to take place in the context of the agreement on the specific initiatives for improved performance through the introduction of incentive workplace agreements,"" BHP said in a short statement.
AWU negotiator Mick Eagles said the wage deal did not affect existing performance-related payments, under which workers can earn quarterly bonuses of up to about five percent of salary.
Eagles described the deal as a good outcome given the prospects for continued low inflation and predicted the wages of all Australian blue-collar workers would come under pressure.  
""I think in this environment, with the way the CPI is, I think the trend in the next 12 months and two years is going to put enormous pressure on wages to be kept low,"" he said.
""So a 10 percent outcome over two years is going to be seen as quite an achievement.""  
A BHP spokesman told Reuters the deal was satisfactory.
""Part of the agreement involves union agreement to introduce new types of employment arrangements which eliminate traditional demarcation lines and have novel concepts in terms of employment which provide us with a business benefit,"" the spokesman said.
""We think this is a satisfactory resolution, bearing in mind the benefits of those innovative agreements,"" he added.
The deal was in line with a recommendation made to the company and union last month by Australia's labour tribunal, the Industrial Relations Commission.  
BHP initially offered eight percent over two years, while the AWU entered negotiations seeking 15 percent over two years.
The agreement comes as wages growth continues to be cited by Australia's central bank as a major concern for inflation, now at historically low levels and well within the Reserve Bank's target range of between two and three percent.
The deal averted the threat of strikes at BHP's steel plants around the country, but the group's minerals division continues to feel the effects of industrial strife.  
About 700 workers downed tools on Thursday over wage and benefits disputes, halting construction of a A$1.5 billion iron ore processing plant being built for BHP at Port Hedland in Western Australia.
The striking workers are engaged to independent contractors hired by BHP.
In November, BHP coal miners in New South Wales state called a strike over cuts in accident compensation payouts.",0
"Time in Tibet is a moveable feast.
In this far-flung outpost of Chinese rule, the clocks are synchronised with Beijing more than 2,560 km (1,590 miles) to the northeast, but dawn is two hours behind and everyone goes to work about two hours later than in Beijing.
It is not only Tibetan time that lags the rest of China. The economy in this Himalayan region, still based largely on yaks, goats and Buddhism, also trails.
Beijing says it is doing its utmost to narrow the gap and to make up for destruction wrought on Tibet's monasteries and temples in China's ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
It has pumped more than 35 billion yuan (US$4.2 billion) into the inaccessible, remote and backward region long peopled by nomadic herders and barter traders, officials say.
The funds are also useful to buttress control of the restive and strategically important region that borders India.
The investment is slowly paying off.
Economic growth in 1995 reached 10.6 percent, up from 8.6 percent the year before. Rural per capita incomes were about 600 yuan ($72) a year while urban incomes neared 2,000 yuan ($240) -- both still about half the national average but increasing rapidly.
In the capital Lhasa, the swift growth of commerce has taken even local leaders by surprise.
""I thought it would take several years before we could attract any real interest,"" said Chen Ciduan, president of the Tibet Investment and Trust Corporation that in 1994 set up a stocks trading centre in Lhasa.
""But we had to double our space last year and we are already overcrowded and making plans for another expansion,"" he said.
That's the high flying end of economic development in Tibet.
For those at the other end of the scale, Beijing is trying to make things easier with preferential policies to help a people struggling into the late 20th century from a lifestyle that more closely resembles the middle ages.
Income tax holidays, tax breaks and easy loans are just some of the incentives available to businessman in Tibet. The concessions are also attracting numerous entrepreneurs from elsewhere in China where such favourable policies are not available.
In Lhasa, one street specialises in selling the highly-decorated, colourfully-painted furniture favoured by Tibetans. Another sells fake leather sofas that appeal to Han Chinese residents.
Chinese restaurants abound, cheek by jowl with Tibetan-managed shops selling yak butter, computer parts and bolts of brocade and wool.
Tibet offers some of China's oddest employment opportunities.
In a tiny one-room workshop leased from a struggling state-owned factory processing yak horns, seven artisans from neighbouring Yunnan province hammer traditional silver bowls embossed with Buddhist symbols.
""We were already making these Buddhist artifacts in Yunnan anyway,"" said workshop owner Li Wenhan, 26. ""It's only because there is so much demand here that we came. We could easily sell these in Yunnan, but here they need them.""
Li said 40 percent of the goods they make are for export, 20-30 percent are sold to Tibetans and the rest distributed elsewhere in China.
The success of Li's business underscores a problem in Tibet that must be as frustrating for its Chinese masters seeking to lead the region into prosperity as for many educated Tibetans.
""The Tibetans lack education and a mentality of work,"" said one Tibetan-Nepali businessman who was born in Lhasa.
""They don't appreciate the need to work, they just want to make a profit straight away,"" he said. ""It's very sad. They are too impatient to understand that you have to earn a living through steady work.""
While some might dispute that view, no one questions that Tibet is among China's poorest and most inaccessible regions. Out of Tibet's 2.3 million people, about 400,000 live below the official poverty line.
Officials oversee one of China's most innovative anti-poverty policies in the deeply devout Buddhist area where many still donate much of what they earn to monasteries and temples and where education is costly.
""We are determined to bring all Tibetans out of poverty by the end of the century,"" said an official who declined to be identified.
Almost all Tibetan government officials are involved in anti-poverty programmes. Each government department in the Tibet Autonomous Region sends officials into rural areas each year -- both to see where government money and aid are most needed and to teach poverty-stricken nomads how to boost their incomes.
Many of Tibet's worst off are nomads living in remote mountain areas, many with large flocks of yaks, goats and sheep, but with little idea of how to exploit their resources.
The nomads either use their animals to feed themselves or, when their numbers climb, set them free as an offering to Buddha to try to win merit for their next reincarnation, believing that their station in each life is dependent on their behaviour in the previous one.
""Many of these people have assets but they are still poor because they don't know how to use them,"" the official said.
Tibet does not rely on handouts alone. Since last year it has worked at setting up sister relationships with 14 of China's booming eastern cities and provinces.
These wealthy cousins each send between 10 to 20 officials to work for three years in the region over a 10-year period and also provide financial resources.
The provinces are helping Tibet with 43 projects, mostly in infrastructure. Initial investment was 2.3 billion yuan ($277.1 million) but now totals more than 3.0 billion yuan ($361 million).
""Tibet's capacity to develop itself is very low,"" the official said. ""It's hampered by its geological conditions such as lack of infrastructure and its remoteness. And it takes a long time to move away from the previous feudal serf system.
""This is a very beautiful place but we have a very arduous task ahead.""

"China's new hardline dictum to its people to battle hostile Western influences with puritan Marxist values underlines a poverty of ideas among an ageing leadership with declining credibility in a fast-changing society, analysts said on Monday.
""They don't seem to grasp that people have changed since the days when they had nothing else to do but to listen to lengthy party documents being broadcast on the radio,"" said one China analyst.
""Nowadays people have so many other activities they may just skim over the headlines and not bother to read something like this,"" he said, referring to a 15,000-character Communist Party document issued in official newspapers on Monday.
""Do the leaders not realise people can channelsurf because it's not just one television station any more?"" he said.
China's ruling Communist Party, in what it hailed as one of its greatest documents ever, warned against hostile Western ideas such as capitalism and parliamentary democracy, urged vigilance against pornography and profit and vowed to fight back with puritan Marxist values.
""If they are seeking to change the average Chinese in the street then this is not the answer,"" said one Western diplomat, describing the newest demand for ideological conformity as a rehash of communist methods practiced for years.
Chinese political analysts have warned that the inability of the communist leadership to move with the times and experiment with new ideas and methods to stir up popular support in a society rapidly being transformed by market-oriented economic reforms could have dangerous repercussions.
""A lot of people just aren't listening any more,"" one analyst said, adding that a consequence of this breakdown of communication would create even more distance between the populace and a leadership that is already remote and secretive.
To recapture popular attention, China's leaders might try to use more extreme propaganda tools, such as whipping up a potentially destabilising nationalist and anti-Western campaign, analysts said.
""We are looking at an ageing leadership -- many of the Politburo are in their 70s -- who are set in their ways and don't seem able to accept younger advisers trying to package acceptable ideology in new wrapping paper,"" one diplomat said.
Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had missed an opportunity to appoint a younger leadership when he purged the upper echelons after the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, analysts and diplomats said.
Analysts said that while the latest communist creed tried to present itself as a balanced dictum, it was clearly intended to achieve the goal of conformity of thought.
""It's pretty much a blueprint for censors to do what they want,"" said one diplomat.
Even conservative newspaper editors appointed in recent years as replacements to more liberal writers have been purged in recent weeks, a succession of books have been ordered off the shelves and popular author Wang Shuo has been effectively banned.
""Things are only going to get worse,"" said one analyst.
However, some doubted how effective a new purge would be.
""It's part and parcel of an attempt to take control of the way people think and the kind of cultural afairs that are conducted,"" the western diplomat said.
""But people don't always take as much notice as they once did,"" he said. ""It may not last much longer than the time it takes to read the thing.""",0
"The U.S. government's top Asian official, Winston Lord, left China on Thursday, wrapping up a low-profile visit after talks that focused on human rights in China and problems on the Korean peninsula.
Diplomats described the meetings as frank and cordial overall, even though Lord raised the thorny issue of China's treatment of its dissidents amid signs of a renewed crackdown by Beijing's communist rulers on their critics.
Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, arrived on Tuesday for the previously unannounced visit and kept a low-profile while in Beijing, a U.S. embassy official said. He left for Japan on Thursday.
Lord held substantive discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu on Wednesday and also had a brief meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, diplomats said.
""They discussed a wide range of issues,"" one Western diplomat said.
The issue of Korea was one focus of the talks and although diplomats said there was little sign of concrete progress, the tone of discussion was positive.
""Both sides want to maintain stability on the peninsula,"" one diplomat said.
South Korea and the United States in April called for four-nation peace talks with North Korea and China to replace a truce that ended the Korean conflict but left Seoul and Pyongyang technically still at war.
Pyongyang has insisted on bilateral talks with Washington to seek an accord, saying Seoul was not a party to the 1953 truce. China has yet to take a clear stance on the four-way talks.
Frosty relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have been in crisis since last month, when 26 North Koreans landed in the South from a stranded submarine.
Diplomats said Lord's talks did not focus on any single issue, and a major aim of his trip was to prepare for a visit next month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
""Generally speaking relations are on the upturn,"" said one diplomat. Christopher is due to visit Beijing on November 21-22 on a trip originally announced in July.
A row over human rights scarred Christopher's last visit to China in 1993.
The visit would mark the highest point in relations since ties plunged after Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui paid a private visit to the United States in June 1995, a trip that enraged Beijing.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Lord had raised Chinese treatment of dissidents.
""Human rights have been on our agenda quite importantly over the last couple of days, because of recent arrests of some of the political dissidents, and the recent travel to the United States of a noted champion of human rights. So, that issue for us is front and centre on our agenda with them.""
Washington last week sharply criticised the sentencing of dissident Liu Xiaobo to three years in a labour camp, as well as apparent plans to try another pro-democracy activist, Wang Dan, on the capital charge of plotting to subvert the government.
Diplomats in Beijing said China would almost certainly be angered by the arrival of a third dissident, Wang Xizhe, in San Francisco this week after escaping from China.
Both sides have said they were moving toward a possible exchange of presidential visits during 1997.
Among outstanding issues that could spark U.S. anger are China's alleged nuclear sales and human rights record while Beijing blames Washington for holding up its application for membership in the World Trade Organisation.",0
"The watchdogs of China's ruling Communist Party have ordered members to obey a call from party chief Jiang Zemin for ideological orthodoxy -- or face disciplinary punishment, state media said on Saturday.
""The work style of the ruling party is a matter of life and death,"" the People's Daily quoted a decision by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China as saying after a meeting this week.
The commission also issued a call for clean government, warning of the threat of corruption to continued party rule.
""Party organisations and members should conscientiously carry on the party's fine traditions and work style,"" it said.
The statement was issued two days after the party wound up its annual policy-making plenum with a pledge to boost orthodox socialist values that have been eroded by nearly two decades of economic reforms.
""Anyone who violates the sixth plenum's decisions, or who disobeys orders, or engages in harmful activities against socialist ethical and cultural progress, should be strictly disciplined,"" the discipline commission said.
The party plenum had said spiritual civilisation -- Chinese communist jargon for ideological orthodoxy and toeing the party line -- could not be sacrificed in the name of the economic reforms spearheaded by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
The commission echoed the plenum's call for a return to the communist puritanism espoused by the late Chairman Mao Zedong.
""The work style of close links to the masses, criticism and self-criticism, hard work, and building a clean and honest government should also be continued,"" the commission said.
The ruling party has seen its credibility undermined in recent years after the chaos of the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and as loopholes for corruption opened up by economic reform have tempted many senior party officials.
""The crackdown on corruption is one of the important tasks of improving the party's work style and clean government and for promoting ethical and cultural progress,"" the commission said.
It called on party committees throughout China to intensify their battle against corruption and to severely punish those found guilty of corruption.
Jiang, who is also state president, has warned repeatedly that corruption is a virus that threatens to topple the party.
Jiang had been expected to seize on the plenum as the last chance before a crucial congress in 1997 to underline his role as anointed heir to Deng Xiaoping, who has been fading gradually from the scene, diplomats and Chinese sources said.
He has made clear that he wants to place his stamp on ideology in China.
The party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, has filled its front page for several days with examples of model workers whose socialist values the populace at large should strive to emulate.
Among these is Beijing bus conductress Li Suli, who is said to rise at 4.00 a.m. to make sure she is familiar with major sites along the route so that she can help disoriented passengers. She then washes the bus windows.",0
"Intense haggling among the world's trade ministers has brought within grasp a lucrative deal to free the global information technology market, officials said Tuesday, and some said they saw movement on the contentious issue of labour standards.
Big powers, notably the United States and the European Union, said a flurry of talks during the second day of the World Trade Organisation ministerial conference had inched toward a global pact to eliminate tariffs on the $600 billion market for information technology.
Differences appeared to narrow on standards to regulate cheap labour and child workers.
WTO officials want a final declaration at the close of the first ministerial meeting of the fledgling trade body on Friday that would point the WTO down the free trade path into the 21st century.
The EU, along with the United States, Canada and Japan, was making progress to reach consensus on an Information Technology Agreement that would be the crowning achievement of the meeting, EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan told reporters.
""We are making a lot of progress,"" Brittan said after a lunchtime meeting of the four major trading partners to discuss types of products to be covered and timing of tariff reductions.
Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefksy said she concurred with Brittan's comments, but declined to say anything more on the proposed pact to remove tariffs on computer products by 2000.
""There is no question that what the industrialised countries now hope for most here is a deal on information technology products and agreement to work hard for a basic telecommunications pact by February,"" said one key negotiator.
Signals from negotiators left little doubt the major traders were aiming for agreement as quickly as possible -- perhaps by Wednesday -- to convince Asian trading partners to sign on to the agreement by the end of the meeting on Friday.
Japan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told the conference he hoped ""ardently .... that we will have an agreement as the most significant achievement of this ministerial conference in the area of trade liberalisation.""
However, several Asian nations voiced reservations, with Malaysia saying the goal of free commerce in infotechnology by the turn of the century was too ambitious.
""We did not come here to discuss the Information Technology Agreement,"" International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said. ""All negotiations should be done in Geneva.""
The 128 full delegations from WTO member countries and ministers and officials from nearly 30 others waiting to be admitted heard ringing appeals for progress toward a telecommunications liberalisation pact with a deadline set for mid-February.
Another late-night meeting was called on the issue of labour standards, which has emerged as the most divisive at the meeting.
A Japanese foreign ministry official told reporters that some developing countries that had opposed any mention of the labour issue in the final declaration were taking a more positive position. ""A possibility of an agreement has emerged,"" he said, but addded that some hard-core emerging economies were holding out.
India, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, have been insisting on no mention at all, arguing that even a neutral phrasing would suggest work conditions were a subject for the WTO.
Aiming to counter lobbying by sceptical Western-based aid groups, the WTO insisted that the poorest nations stood to reap major benefit from the freeing of global commerce.
But WTO officials admitted that Director-General Renato Ruggiero had failed to convince richer members, both industrialised and emerging economies, to remove all tariffs and other barriers affecting goods from the laggard states.
The European Union made little headway in efforts to persuade its main trading partners to jump-start stalled talks on China's bid for WTO admission. But Russia, another major member-in-waiting, expected to win entry by the end of 1997, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Davydov said.",0
"China has launched a manhunt across the restive region of Tibet, tightened airport security and offered a reward of $120,000 for the arrest of culprits who exploded a bomb in Lhasa last week, officials said on Monday.
The government had announced a reward of one million yuan ($120,000) for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the bomb blast early on Christmas Day outside city government offices in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, a senior official said.
""No one has yet been arrested and we are now mobilising and deploying our forces,"" Lhasa Vice Mayor Ou Yangxiang said in a telephone interview.
Notice of the reward had been published in the Lhasa Evening News on December 27 and it was being issued in other newspapers in the strategic Himalayan region, government officials said.
The Christmas Day bomb, the largest so far set off by anti-Chinese activists in restive Tibet, had resulted in no casualties but caused widespread damage, shattering windows within a radius of 100 metres (yards), officials said.
""Almost the whole of Lhasa heard it,"" said one Lhasa government official. ""It was a muffled sound, like -- whoong.""
Officials insisted there was little doubt that the blast was politically motivated and carried out by followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
The bomb exploded at night outside a government building and was therefore clearly political, said Zhou Kaifu, deputy director of the Tibet Public Security Bureau.
""This was done by the Dalai separatist camp,"" the government official said, adding that the attack bore the hallmarks of previous similar ""terrorist acts"". He declined to give details although several smaller bombings have been reported in Lhasa.
""This is a terrorist act, aimed at destroying peace in our area,"" he said. ""This was a brazen act.""
Police had set up a special task force to search for the culprits and customs and immigration officials had stepped up security searches at Tibet's airport, he said.
The senior police official said the bomb was a home-made device made mainly from ammonium nitrate, a fertiliser.
""We are targeting Tibetan exiles returning from abroad and who have political connections,"" he said when asked about the focus of the manhunt.
""The bomb was made at a farm,"" he said. ""We are searching mainly in Lhasa, but are cooperating with other areas.""
China regularly blames followers of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, for anti-Chinese unrest that erupts sporadically in the strategic Himalayan region that borders India.
The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent campaign to win autonomy for his homeland, says he wants self-government and freedom of worship in the deeply religious Buddhist region. He fled China in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Beijing rule.
Monks in the devout Buddhist region who have spearheaded anti-Chinese demonstrations and riots in the past were not regarded as suspects, the police official said.
Officials have vowed to retaliate, signalling a possible renewed crackdown on anti-Chinese unrest in the region.
""We should wage a tit-for-tat struggle against the Dalai clique's sabotage,"" local radio quoted Gyamco, vice chairman of the regional government as saying last week.
Several much smaller bombs have been been set off in Lhasa in the last two years, including one in 1995 that caused slight damage to a plaque donated by Beijing and another last March outside the headquarters of the Tibet regional government.",0
"Leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has been ordered to serve three years in a labour camp in a term imposed just hours after police detained him and a second pro-democracy activist was missing, relatives said on Wednesday.
Veteran pro-democracy activist Wang Xizhe, who recently issued a joint statement with Liu, appeared to be missing from his home in southern Guangzhou, his wife said by telephone.
Police had notified Liu Xiaobo's wife early on Wednesday of the administrative three-year sentence, which does not need a court trial, but gave her no reason for the punishment.
""They have still had no formal contact with me or given me a reason,"" Liu Xia said in a telephone interview late in the day.
""I am very angry. How can they do this?,"" she said. ""He did not do anything illegal. All he did was exercise his freedom of speech... Citizens have freedom of speech...""
She said she had not yet decided whether to appeal on his behalf.
The administrative punishment was passed against Liu just hours after he was taken from his Beijing home early on Tuesday by a group of uniformed and plainclothes police, with a search warrant, who also confiscated books, papers and photographs.
""Re-education through labour is the personal power of the public security bureau, it doesn't have to go through judicial departments,"" Liu Xia said. ""The public security can just do as they wish.""
Police officials declined to comment.
The administrative punishment of re-education through labour has been increasingly used against dissidents in recent months as a means of removing activists from circulation while avoiding the more complicated trial process, diplomats say.
Police gave no reason for the detention of Liu, a renowned literary critic who gained fame as a dissident in the 1989 student-led pro-democracy movement that was crushed by the military with heavy loss of life.
Liu has been active in recent months, sending several daring, open letters to the government.
On September 30, Liu and Wang issued a statement urging China's communist authorities to honour a promise in 1945 to give people freedom of the press and speech and to form political parties and stage demonstrations.
In a bold move, the two demanded Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin be indicted, impeached and step down for violating the constitution for saying the People's Liberation Army was under the ""absolute leadership"" of the party instead of the state.
Wang did not return home on Tuesday and his wife said she was very worried because he had not responded to his pager.
Wang was paroled in 1993 after serving 12 years of a 14-year term for sedition and remains deprived of his political rights. He is one of China's most outspoken proponents of democracy.
Liu was last detained by police in 1995 after orchestrating several daring petitions to parliament by dissidents and intellectuals in the early months of the year. He was held for seven months without charges until being released in January.
His sentence comes shortly after Chinese sources said dissident and former student leader Wang Dan faced a second jail term after prosecutors charged him recently with subversion.
Wang, 26, faces up to seven years in jail on charges of counter-revolutionary incitement -- or subversion.
Wang, who is believed to have worked with Liu on several daring petitions, was detained in May, 1995 in the run-up to the sixth anniversary of the June 1989 military crackdown.",0
"China's usually rubber stamp parliament failed on Monday to pass an anti-corruption bill after the proposed law fell victim to fierce debate over whether it should specifically target government officials.
State media had reported heated discussion at the week-long session of the standing committee of the National People's Congress, or parliament, that closed on Monday.
Disputes among China's usually tame lawmakers ranged from controversy surrounding the scope of the death penalty as contained in proposed amendments of the criminal law to whether corrupt state managers should be executed.
The draft law on administrative supervision, which would target corruption and had been due to be adopted this week, was eventually withdrawn from voting, the Xinhua news agency said.
The law was withdrawn ""because legislators sharply disagreed with the name of the law"", it said, quoting parliament chairman Qiao Shi.
Some lawmakers believed the bill should be named the Law On Administrative Supervision in line with its regulation of the government.
However, they ran into opposition on constitutional grounds from legislators who argued it should be called simply the Law on Supervision, without reference to the administration, Xinhua said, but did not elaborate.
Qiao suggested the issue be put forward for a vote at the next standing committee session in February, 1997.
Beijing has launched repeated crackdowns on graft, which senior leaders have called a cancer that threatens the Communist Party's grip on power, but many Chinese say enforcement of anti-corruption measures at senior levels is patchy at best.
Debate had swirled around amendments to combat corruption, including more than 60 clauses that would specifically define draft and dereliction of duty, while increasing to 32 from seven the types of officials subject to the law, state media said.
One source of contention was the designation of managers of state firms as government employees, who are subject to a maximum penalty of death for corruption, it said.
One body of opinion held that government factory managers be defined as public servants since 75 percent of all official cases of corruption involved state enterprise managers.
Others argued this was unfair since managers of non-state firms faced a maximum of only 15 years in jail for graft.
All should be equal before the law, the newspaper quoted the criminal law as saying regarding the need to tackle corruption
The failure of the anti-corruption law to pass came as senior leaders considered whether to punish scandal-hit former Beijing Party boss Chen Xitong -- the highest-ranking victim of China's anti-corruption campaign -- for dereliction of duty.
Under the law, prosecutors would have the powers to investigate a suspect's bank account and ask the courts to freeze bank accounts of those suspected of graft, bribery and embezzlement.
In the first 11 months of 1996, Chinese prosecutors had begun action in 77,611 cases of corruption, bribery and economic crime and had dealt with 33,879 cases, up year-on-year 9.4 percent, the media said.
Corruption was virtually wiped out in the years after the communists took over in 1949 but has staged a comeback after economic reforms were introduced 17 years ago.",0
"China defended on Saturday its decision to exercise its veto at the United Nations for the first time in nearly a quarter of a century, killing a U.N. plan to monitor disarmament and a ceasefire in Guatemala.
""We had no choice but to vote against the draft decision on peacekeeping,"" the Xinhua news agency quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang as saying.
""Clearly, the government of Guatemala must be wholly responsible,"" he said and made clear that China had no objection to the dispatch of U.N. peacekeepers to oversee a peace that ended a brutal 36-year-old civil war.
Shen accused Guatemala of forcing China to exercise its veto because the Central American country had maintained ties with Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province not entitled to international diplomatic links.
At a late Friday night meeting, all Security Council members except China voted in favour of a resolution that would have sent 155 peacekeepers to Guatemala for three months under a U.N.-brokered peace accord signed on December 29 between the government and leftist rebels.
In Beijing, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said Guatemala was to blame not only for recognising Taiwan but for joining a number of other small countries since 1993 to sponsor a General Assembly resolution aimed at securing U.N. membership for the Asian economic powerhouse.
Shen also lashed out at Guatemala's decision to invite Taiwan Foreign Minister John Chang to last month's peace signing ceremony in Guatemala City.
China had offered solutions to the impasse but Guatemala had remained resolute, Shen charged.
""Guatemala cannot expect on the one hand to do something that harms the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China while on the other hand requesting China to cooperate on peacekeeping,"" Shen said.
The negative vote on Friday by China, which along with the United States, Britain, France and Russia, has veto power in the 15-member council, meant that Council President Hisashi Owada of Japan had to announce that the resolution had failed.
It was China's first U.N. Security Council veto in nearly 24 years.
Taiwan has given generous economic aid to several small, impoverished states around the world in its bid to break out of a diplomatic isolation imposed by China. Taiwan was expelled from the U.N. in 1971 and replaced by Beijing as the rightful representative of China.
Under the peace accord, Guatemala's army would redeploy units to specified locations, after which troops from the rebel Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unit (URNG) would move to eight assembly points and disarm. The U.N. observers were to verify the process.
The drafters of the resolution -- the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Spain and Norway --  decided to push ahead with the vote, despite China's threat of a veto, saying that further talks could not overcome the differences.
China had never spelled out publicly what Guatemala was expected to do. But diplomats said it sought a pledge to refrain from sponsoring further pro-Taiwan U.N. resolutions and to stop receiving high-ranking Taiwanese visitors.",0

"China hailed on Tuesday its war on bourgeois decadence as the top news event of 1996 along with missile tests off Taiwan, but ignored improved ties with the United States and the jailing of a dozen dissidents.
The line-up of the top 10 news events in China in 1996 as selected by senior editors of the major Communist Party-linked newspapers closely reflected the party line on news -- or propaganda.
The list issued by the Xinhua news agency differed sharply from events in China that have focused international eyes on the world's most populous country in the last 12 months.
Heading the list selected by 12 Beijing editors was the annual plenum of China's ruling Communist Party in October that adopted a 15,000-word document exhorting China's 1.2 billion people to adhere to socialist ethics and abhor bourgeois Western liberalism.
On Christmas Eve, it was unclear how far socialist values extended, but Santa Claus appeared to be exempt as he smiled and waved from dozens of Beijing and Shanghai department stores.
Politics, not only news value, may have coloured the views of many of the editors, who would have remembered that the plenum was trumpeted as one of the major achievements of Communist Party chief, state President and army boss Jiang Zemin -- anointed heir to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
Newspaper editors elsewhere in the world would probably have chosen Beijing's campaign to intimidate Taiwan in the run-up the island's first popular elections of a Chinese president on Chinese soil as the top story of 1996.
However, for Chinese editors the decision to conduct missile tests and live-fire war games in waters near the island last March, and which sent U.S. aircraft carriers steaming into neighbouring seas, ranked only fourth in their top 10.
The news item in second place related to China's resumption of sovereignty over the British colony of Hong Kong in mid-1997, or Premier Li Peng's decision to sign off on the appointment of shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as Hong Kong's first post-colonial chief executive.
Other editors might have focused less on the role of a single Chinese leader in Tung's elevation and more on his selection by a Beijing-sponsored committee of his peers.
Four of the top 10 Chinese news stories were linked to economic achievements and one to sports -- the Atlanta Olympic Games in which China ranked fourth overall in the medals' tally. Just two involved international affairs.
President Jiang's visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines last month edged into fifth place.
Jiang's APEC meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton set the seal on a warming of frosty Sino-U.S. ties and resulted in a decision on an exchange of the first presidential state visits in nearly eight years. But for China's news commissars, that merited only a brief aside.
""Chinese President Jiang Zemin... met with leaders of other APEC members, including U.S. President Clinton,"" Xinhua said.
China's renewed crackdown on dissent, such as its decision to sentence Wang Dan, a former leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy, to 11 years in jail for conspiring to subvert the government, went unmentioned.",0
"For 36 years Tibet's biggest leather factory gushed pollution into one of the world's cleanest rivers and haemorrhaged losses.
But help was at hand when Tibet's scenic beauty and devout Buddhist people enchanted visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in 1988.
German aid has since poured in, along with German technicians, transforming the plant into a rare model of environmental awareness on the roof of the world. It has also made its first net profit.
Manager Li Jishan glowed with pride as he described the modernisation wrought at his plant over the last few years.
""When I first came here in 1961 things were really backward. We lived in tents. Can you imagine?"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
The leather factory was moved to Lhasa in 1959 from Golmud in neighbouring Qinghai province to provide footleather for thousands of soldiers sent to garrison Tibet after an abortive uprising by Tibetans seeking independence in 1958.
As a state-owned firm that processes yak skins into shoes and handbags it had little incentive to turn a profit. That is slowly changing.
Last year, the China-Germany Joint Venture Lhasa Leather Factory of Tibet reported a profit of 200,000 yuan ($24,000) -- a modest sum but the first in its history.
""We have a good future, our efficiency is good...and with German assistance we are placing great emphasis on environmental protection,"" said Li, adding that he expected another profit this year.
""The German side is very strict, especially on environmental protection,"" he noted. ""But we get along with them very well.""
One problem identified by the German side is one common to most of China's state-owned firms -- the huge surplus labour that is the legacy of jobs-for-life socialism.
""We have had arguments with the German experts who want to fire someone, for example,"" said Li. ""But they have come to understand our point of view and our system.""
However, German officials still warn that keeping on a couple of hundred extra staff is bound to affect profits.
German officials said the plant had been an environmental disaster when they arrived, with its tannery spouting stinking waste into the nearby rushing Tolungchu river.
""It was in really bad shape with terrible environmental problems,"" said Niels von Keyserlingk, director of the office of the German Development Corporation in Beijing that oversees aid to the plant.
""Before, the water was untreated and flowed into the river causing many problems,"" he said. ""But things have been very nicely done. There is no pollution.""
All chemicals are recycled now and a German-manufactured system cleans the water, separating waste that is dried for use by local farmers as fertiliser.
""The water that flows into the river is absolutely clean,"" said von Keyserlingk, who visited the plant last May.
A cement factory on the opposite bank belching dust into the clear mountain area could pose a new environmental hazard.
Germany has given 15 million deutschemarks ($9.8 million) in aid to the plant, which has been allowed to register as a joint venture and thus qualifies for the generous tax breaks and holidays that Tibet offers to foreign investors.
German money has helped to buy the latest in leather processing machinery as well as sewing machines, waste elimination plants and even new solar energy panels that are heating water for the factory.
Sales have soared. The factory held an eight percent share of the Tibet shoe market for years, but in 1994 that jumped to 20 percent and nearly doubled again in 1995 to a 36 percent market share.
""Our products are really popular because they are all leather, and people want that kind of quality,"" Li said.
The factory is trying to boost sales to the rest of China as well as overseas exports, particularly to neighbouring Nepal.
But it faces awesome transport handicaps in shipping goods from a city that has no rail links and must send merchandise more than 1,000 km (600 miles) over some of China's most difficult roads to the nearest railway station.
""We still need to raise quality and produce more different styles of shoes to compete in the market,"" said Li, who has clearly picked up some tips from his German market-savvy experts.
""Either you learn to swim in the market or you drown.""",0
"China will accelerate listings of new firms on its two stock markets next year to meet demand and curb speculation, a senior securities official said.
His remarks, published on Sunday, came a week after an official statement warned investors away from excessive speculation, triggering a steep sell-off on the Shanghai and southern Shenzhen stock exchanges.
However, an official of the top securities watchdog, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, sounded another note of caution, saying that the markets needed even tighter regulation because of insider trading, excessive speculation and trading on margin.
""It will remain at the top of our work agenda for a fairly long period of time to further supervise the stock market, and curb over-speculation and irregularities ... to better protect the interests of the smaller investors,"" Xinhua quoted the unidentified official as saying.
Since the People's Daily editorial one week ago, Shanghai's domestic A share index has tumbled 20.07 percent, standing at 922.34 points last Friday compared with 1,163.05 at the close a week before.
The foreign currency B index fell 3.84 percent to 63.743 points from 66.291 points a week ago after a roller-coaster five days of trading.
China would move more swiftly to list additional firms on the markets, in line with the recent market upswings, Xinhua quoted Zhang Dongsheng, a deputy director of the Finance and Banking Department of the State Planning Commission, as saying.
""This is part of the nation's effort to balance supply and demand in the stock market and curb excessive speculation,"" Zhang said.
Last week China announced a share quota of 10 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) for 1996 and to be carried over into 1997, almost double the 5.5 billion yuan approved for the previous year.
Analysts said one aim of the decision to flood the fledgling stock markets with new issues was to soak up excess funds that have fuelled a flurry of speculation in recent months.
At its height just a few days ago, Shanghai's domestic A share index had surged more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart over 300 percent since April, when Beijing announced that it supported development of the stock markets.
In a sign of soaring interest in securities, official figures show 21 million Chinese have now opened trading accounts, up from just 12 million at the start of the year and rocketing from 14 million in September, Xinhua said.
The rapidly growing number of stock investors had caused the market to overheat on a shortage of supply, resulting in runaway price rises and excessive speculation, Xinhua said.
""The current market size allows some institutional investors to manipulate the stock prices and drive them up to ridiculous highs,"" it quoted Cao Fengqi, a financial expert at prestigious Beijing University, as saying.
""An accelerated expansion of the Chinese stock market will boost the capital market and help pool more funds for capital-strapped enterprises,"" he said.
Speculation could be curbed only if the market was big enough to handle demand, he added.
Beijing, which says its stock exchanges and futures markets are experiments, was committed to the markets, Xinhua said.
Current market capitalisation of more than 1.33 trillion yuan, almost triple the 1995 figure, accounts for 18 percent of China's gross domestic product, compared with six percent at the end of last year, Xinhua added. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)",0
"Detained Chinese dissident Wang Dan faces the capital charge of plotting to subvert the government based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad, a human rights group said on Saturday.
Wang Dan's case was expected to come to trial next week, the New York-based Human Rights in China said in a statement.
Relatives said on Friday they had succeeded in finding a lawyer willing to defend Wang, the former leader of the 1989 student demonstrations for more democracy centred in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
The Beijing People's Intermediate Court on Thursday informed Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, that she had one day to find her son a lawyer, a signal that the dissident had been indicted and a trial was imminent.
The family on Friday obtained a copy of the court chargesheet, which formally accused the 26-year-old of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death.
The indictment cited four major areas of evidence against Wang, Human Rights in China said.
The first was the writing of articles published in overseas magazines and newspapers, including some that criticised the government, in the three years since his release from jail.
Wang served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations, which were crushed by the army on June 3-4 with heavy loss of life.
Other evidence against the former student at prestigious Beijing University included taking part in studies at home organised by the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States, Human Rights in China said.
The charges accused Wang and other dissidents of joining forces to collect funds and donations to help other dissidents facing difficulties and the lack of work after their release from prison, the group said.
Wang was also accused of accepting donations and economic aid from overseas organisations, it said.
Wang's lawyer had already visited the court dealing with Wang's case to begin legal formalities, but there was still no news of when the trial of the former student leader, who has been in detention since May 1995, would begin, a close relative said.
""We feel pretty anxious. We are just waiting for new developments,"" the relative told Reuters.
The outspoken activist attracted the ire of China's communist authorities in 1989 when he shot to prominence as a leader of student protests for more democracy centred on Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital.
Wang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng -- a nominee for this year's Nobel Peace Prize -- of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.
The court's verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people ""convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan"". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.
Wang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.",0
"Top Hollywood film stars, including screen idols Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt, have been placed on a blacklist of 50 people barred from visiting the restive region of Tibet, Chinese officials said on Friday.
News that some of Hollywood's biggest box office draws were on a blacklist comes just weeks after Beijing clashed with U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Co over its film on the life of Tibet's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama.
Brad Pitt, Harrison Ford and his wife Melissa Mathison Ford as well as directors Martin Scorsese and Jean-Jaques Annaud were among a group of movie personalities on a blacklist held by the Tibet Tourism Bureau, a tourist official said by telephone from the regional capital, Lhasa.
""Last October, we were verbally informed by the Tibet state security office that those foreigners should not be given an entry permit if they applied to visit Tibet,"" he said.
""At the end of April or in early May, we received the formal documents,"" he said, when asked if the Hollywood stars were barred from the Himalayan region that has been rocked by sporadic anti-Chinese unrest in recent years.
""They are banned from coming here for any reason,"" the official said, adding that none of those named on the list had yet applied to visit.
Brad Pitt stars as an escaped Austrian prisoner of war, who fled India in World War Two and found refuge in Lhasa where he befriended the young Dalai Lama, in the film ""Seven Years in Tibet"" that is directed by Annaud. China has not formally objected to the film.
However, it has apparently tried to halt production by California-based Walt Disney of the film ""Kundun"" that tells of the Dalai Lama's early life and is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie.
Disney has said it will go ahead with the release of ""Kundun"" despite China's objections. Beijing has denied putting pressure on Disney to withdraw backing for the film.
Beijing has been reported to have warned Walt Disney last month that its ambitious business plans in China were at risk if it went ahead with the release of the movie.
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said Disney would be wrong to sing the praises of the exiled spiritual leader.
The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and has since waged a non-violent campaign for autonomy for his homeland.
However, the blacklist did not include actor Richard Gere, who has long backed the Tibetan spiritual movement and is an active supporter of the Dalai Lama, the tourism official said.
Gere was among a group of movie luminaries who this month wrote to China's ambassador in Washington protesting against what they called Beijing's ""attempt to impose worldwide censorship"".
Officials had begun to compile a blacklist of foreigners barred from visiting the restive area in 1993, and the list had now reached more than 50 names, he said.
All foreign visitors to Tibet are required first to obtain an entry permit issued by local authorities who are anxious to keep out Westerners who may support the underground pro-independence movement spearheaded by the region's monks.",0
"China is unlikely to concede on its demand to enter the World Trade Organisation as a developing country and has the patience to hunker down for a long wait to win accession on its terms, a senior Chinese analyst said.
""Both sides need to make concessions, but there is one issue of principle on which China will not change,"" Pei Changhong, head of the department of Foreign Economy and Trade under the leading think-tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told Reuters in an interview at the weekend.
""China will only enter as a developing country,"" Pei said, referring to one stumbling block -- that of Beijing's entry status. The United States insists that the size of China's economy ranks it as a developed country.
""This is a matter of principle,"" Pei said.
China was deeply disappointed when its application to join the world trade body as a founding member two years ago failed, and talks since in Geneva have proceeded at a snail's pace.
He said he expected little progress when ministers of the WTO's 125 member states meet in Singapore this week, with China attending under observer status, but said China would seize the opportunity to explain its stand in meetings on the sidelines.
""After we gain recognition of our status then the talks could more easily proceed,"" Pei said. ""There may be the possibility of concessions (by China) on some concrete issues.""
Pei declined to say where China might be prepared to offer concessions in line with a ""road map"" presented to Beijing by Washington outlining liberalisations it wants before it will support Chinese membership.
He said China's economy was already remarkably open compared with some of its neighbours such as Japan and South Korea.
""When you go shopping in Beijing you see goods from all over the world on every shelf,"" he said. ""You don't see nearly so many Chinese products on foreign shelves.""
Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced at the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last month in the Philippines that China would slash average import tariffs to 15 percent by 2000 from the current 23 percent.
Pei said non-tariff barriers still existed in China, citing the service sector as one area to which foreign firms were eager to gain admittance, but insisted Beijing was gradualling pulling down these barriers.
""Opening up requires a process,"" he said. ""It is a fact that China is a backward country and must protect some parts of its economy. The demands on us must not be too harsh.""
Pei offered a less optimistic view than China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen who has said talks with the United States on entry could be wrapped up by mid-1997 as well as WTO chief Renato Ruggiero who has said next year could see a solution to the exclusion of the world's most populous nation from the world trade body.
Pei said 1997 seemed a rather ambitious target given the distance between the United States and China on many issues, but said he hoped to see entry by 1999.
""There are both advantages and disadvantages to China from entry to the WTO,"" Pei said, setting off the access to worldwide markets for Chinese goods against the cost and competition its domestic industry would face.
""China's stand now is that it is up to the other side,"" Pei said.
""China actively wants membership but it can wait. It will be good for China to enter but it won't be a catastrophe if we have to wait,"" he said.
""It is in no one's interests to keep China out.""",0
"One of China's most prominent dissidents, Wang Dan, is expected to receive a harsh sentence on the charge of plotting to overthrow the government, his mother said on Tuesday.
Wang, 27, would plead not guilty to the capital charge when his trial at the Beijing Intermediate People's Court begins on Wednesday, said the dissident's mother, Wang Lingyun.
""The court...giving my son a harsh sentence even though he is innocent is very likely to happen,"" Wang Lingyun told Reuters. ""I dare not rule it out.""
She said court officials told her the verdict could be delivered as early as Wednesday or in two days. Family members had been under surveillance for several weeks, she added.
The former student leader, who vanished into detention in May 1995, faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a maximum penalty of death.
The court has refused to give details of Wang's trial except to say he has been charged with plotting to overthrow the government.
The New York-based Human Rights Watch said last week the chances of acquittal were slim because Wang has not had adequate time to prepare a defence.
His family found a lawyer willing to defend the dissident after being given just one day in which to do so.
Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, would attend the trial as one of two defence lawyers. His father and a sister would be allowed to sit in.
The mother has said the dissident was calm and mentally prepared for a harsh sentence, although she has said his health had deteriorated during his detention.
Human Rights Watch attacked the trial on Tuesday as a sign of the Chinese leadership's increasing intolerance of dissent.
""The fact is that China's urban dissident movement... has in effect been comprehensively smashed,"" it said in a statement.
""At least where political dissidents are concerned, all the judicial signs thus far point... to intensified repression by the country's state security forces,"" it said, calling for a freeze on trade missions from the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia.
The human rights group said Chinese criminal trials seldom respect the presumption of innocence, and defence lawyers were generally restricted to arguing mitigating circumstances for a reduced sentence.
Wang's court appearance would likely be held out of the public eye, as was last year's trial of Wei Jingsheng, regarded as the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement.
Officials have been silent on a request by the U.S. embassy in Beijing to send observers to Wang's trial, diplomats said.
French senator Robert Badinter, former U.S. attorneys general Nicholas Katzenback and Richard Thornburgh, and former Canadian solicitor-general Warren Allmand have also said they want to observe Wang's trial.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang on Tuesday shrugged off questions from reporters about the status of the requests, saying Wang's trial was China's internal affair.
Beijing has repeatedly come under fire from the West for human rights abuses. It says foreign intervention in China's internal affairs is not welcome.
Wang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that were crushed by the army in June 1989 with heavy loss of life.
He was politically active again after his parole in 1993, defying police surveillance to join a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests.
China has recently cracked down on the few remaining dissidents who have not fled into exile or been jailed.",0
"Draft amendments to China's criminal law have sparked fierce debate among usually tame lawmakers, with controversy surrounding the scope of the death penalty and whether corrupt state managers should be executed.
The Workers Daily newspaper on Saturday published a rare insight into controversies troubling a string of amendments to the Criminal Law, currently under debate by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, or parliament, that meets behind closed doors.
""Looking at the last few days of debate by the standing committee of the draft criminal law amendments, argument on specific clauses has been very fierce,"" the newspaper said in an unusual expose of controversy in the usually rubber-stamp body.
The criminal law amendments along with a new anti-corruption law were two main items on the agenda of a week-long meeting of the standing committee that began on Tuesday to debate bills to be passed by the full annual session of parliament next March.
""Are there too many death penalties?"" was one of the top controversies this week, the Workers Daily said.
""Some people think that, with the international tide moving toward eliminating or reducing the use of the death penalty, even though the current amendments do not increase the number of death penalty clauses, however the current criminal law with more than 30 capital crimes should be reduced,"" it said.
China executes several thousand people each year and international human rights group Amnesty International recorded 3,612 death sentences and 2,535 executions in China in 1995 compared with 2,496 death sentences and 1,791 executions in 1994. Hundreds, if not thousands more, go unreported.
From January 1, when a new criminal procedures law takes effect, China will add lethal injection as well as execution by firing squad as a new means of capital punishment.
The Workers Daily said another body of legislative opinion held that the death penalty should neither be reduced or eliminated because it served as a deterrent and answered a popular demand for harsher punishments to prevent crime.
Debate also swirled around amendments to combat corruption, including more than 60 clauses that would specifically define graft and dereliction of duty, while increasing to 32 from seven the types of officials subject to the law, the newspaper said.
Heated argument surrounded the designation of managers of state firms as government employees, who are subject to a maximum penalty of death for corruption, it said.
One body of opinion held that government factory managers be defined as public servants since 75 percent of all official cases of corruption involved state enterprise managers.
Others argued this was unfair since managers of non-state firms faced a maximum of only 15 years in jail for graft.
""On this issue, the Supreme People's Procuratorate and the Supreme People's Court hold very different opinions,"" the newspaper said.
All should be equal before the law, the newspaper quoted the criminal law as saying regarding the need to tackle corruption, which is regarded as the chief threat to Communist rule.
It made no mention of a former Beijing city party boss who was sacked in early 1995 after a vice-mayor committed suicide in a $37 million corruption scandal, but has yet to face charges.
Another source of contention among legislators was a proposal that police acting in the line of duty should bear no criminal responsibility for killing or injuring a suspect.
This proposal had won strong support from the Ministry of Public Security, especially after the deaths of 100 police in the first half of this year, it said.
""Those opposed believe that this regulation could be used as an excuse in cases when casualties result from improper use of weapons,"" the Workers Daily said.",0
"Wang Dan's name cards describe him as ""Free Man"" and ""World Citizen"", but for the next 11 years the democracy activist's world will be a prison.
The disappearance of the 27-year-old into the Chinese gulag on Wednesday signalled a tightening of the Communist Party's grip on all aspects of life -- from religion to crime, from where people may speak to where they may spit.
The sentencing of the former leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations left only a handful of the country's dissidents free.
The Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court took less than four hours to convict Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government.
""What do they really think they have to be afraid of from people like me?"" said one prominent dissident after learning that Wang Dan had been jailed.
""Of course, they don't really believe that a kid in his 20s poses a threat,"" said the dissident, who like others interviewed recently, declined to be identified.
""But by putting him in jail they create a hostage who they can release whenever they feel they need to make a gesture on human rights to the West,"" said the dissident, who spent the day of Wang's trial with a policeman posted in his living room.
The dissident is one of a rapidly dwindling band still at liberty in China.
Most are either sentenced to lengthy jail terms, serving in labour camps, living in voluntary exile or enforced banishment overseas or just keeping their heads down while the security apparatus seeks pretexts to lock them up and remove what it sees as a potential threat to party rule.
""Don't think for a moment that the aim of sending Wang Dan to jail is just to frighten people like me,"" said the dissident.
""This is a warning to the United States that says 'We can be tough to our own people and we can be tough to you, too',"" he said.
This week, a U.S. State Department official underlined the tensions in the Sino-U.S. relationship by describing China's current leadership as the most difficult that Washington has had to deal with in 25 years.
When U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher comes to China in late November he will find few dissidents to add to his cocktail party guest list.
Historian Bao Zunxin, a veteran of the ill-fated 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations who wrote a letter to the government this year calling for a crackdown on corruption, lives quietly in Beijing.
Outspoken environmental champion and author Dai Qing -- who spent months in prison after the June 4, 1989, military crackdown in Tiananmen Square -- writes, campaigns against the huge Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze river and often gives interviews in Beijing to foreign reporters.
Veteran democracy activist Xu Wenli this year completed a 15-year prison term for subversion but has kept silent since a police ban on meeting foreigners and publishing his writings.
Ren Wanding, like Xu a veteran of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, was released this year from a seven-year term for his role in the 1989 student movement and has kept a low profile, unable to meet foreigners or to vent his opinions.",0
"The U.S. government's top Asia official, Winston Lord, was to hold talks with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu in Beijing on a range of issues including human rights, diplomats said on Wednesday.
Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, arrived on Tuesday for the unannounced visit and was keeping a low profile while in Beijing, a U.S. embassy official said.
However he was due to hold talks with Deputy Foreign Minister Liu and a possible meeting with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was on the agenda before Lord left on Thursday for Japan, diplomats said.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Tuesday that Lord was preparing for a visit next month by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, but officials said a wide range of other issues would almost certainly be raised.
""Human rights will come up,"" one diplomat said.
Washington last week sharply criticised the sentencing of dissident Liu Xiaobo to three years in a labour camp, as well as apparent plans to try another pro-democracy activist, Wang Dan, on the capital charge of plotting to subvert the government.
U.S. officials say relations with China have generally improved in recent months, but there have been frictions in the past two weeks over its treatment of dissidents and over fresh reports of Chinese nuclear sales to Pakistan.
""I think all issues are on the table in (Lord's) discussions with the Chinese. It wouldn't surprise me at all if that issue of the alleged sale of items between China and Pakistan came up,"" Burns said.
Nevertheless, he said Washington continued to maintain that China had not violated past pledges with the sale, which the Washington Times said last week consisted of a special industrial furnace and high-tech diagnostic equipment.
Burns also said human rights issues were likely to be raised.
Diplomats said Beijing would almost certainly be angered by reports that Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe had arrived in San Francisco for asylum in the United States.
A row over human rights scarred Christopher's last visit to China in 1993.
Christopher is due to visit China on November 21-22 on a trip originally announced in July.
The visit would mark the highest point in relations since ties plunged after Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui paid a private visit to the United States in June, 1995 -- a trip that enraged Beijing.
Both sides have said they are moving towards a possible exchange of presidential visits during 1997.
Among outstanding issues that could spark U.S. anger are the alleged nuclear sales and China's human rights record, while Beijing blames Washington for holding up its application for membership of the World Trade Organisation.
U.S. officials said Lord had considered the possibility of extending his trip beyond South Korea when he left Washington last week, but did not finally decide to do so until he was already in Asia.
Lord came to China after a visit to South Korea to discuss tensions over the beaching of a North Korean submarine on the South Korean coast last month.  
""With more and more (listed) firms involving in such takeovers, regulation and supervision has become a tough task,"" said one analyst with China Guotai Securities.
""The central government should not wait until there are too many headaches before taking measures to sort things out,"" he said.
But the analyst said that despite the problems, takeovers would be a focus of the stock market over the next few years because of restrictions in other areas, including a ban on mergers between listed firms and unlisted firms.
In the six-year history of modern China's stock markets, there has been no case of a takeover of one listed firm by another.",0
"The Inter-African Coffee Organization (IACO) will focus on low world prices at its 1996/97 coffee season annual meeting in Abidjan on November 17-19, IACO's chief economist said on Friday.
""In spite of a world export programme the indicative robusta price is only at 73 cents per pound. This is too low,"" chief economist Donald Kaberuka told Reuters on Friday.
""We do not aim to set a target price but today's composite price for robusta and arabica, 99.29 cents, is also low,"" he said. ""Any recommendations will be sent to the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC).""
Last May the ACPC, which represents 80 percent of world production, agreed to limit green coffee exports from its 14 members to 53.5 million 60-kg bags in the year to June 1997 after 48.9 million in 95/96.
Africa's total 1996/97 export allocation under the ACPC plan is 12,840,000 bags, or 24 percent of total ACPC target.
The 25-member group of African IACO exporters were very concerned by persistent low prices on the world markets despite a producer plan to limit exports, Kaberuka said in an interview.
""The market could be in balance this year as there is only a small production surplus. We are perplexed by the low prices and want the plan to have an impact,"" he added.
Kaberuka, who is in charge of ACPC target management for IACO, said IACO provisions allowed a review of the export plan after six months, meaning December.
IACO's 25 members would study the situation and then decide if action was needed. Full agenda details are not yet available.
IACO last met in Gabon in November 1995 to review volatile world markets, coffee rehabilitation plans and financing deals for exporters.
This time last year the world export plan aimed to stabilise market prices at 135 cents/lb for robusta and 165 cents for arabica. Prices then were 114 and 128 cents respectively.",0
"One of Ivory Coast's largest cocoa and coffee exporters, SIFCA, will appoint a liquidator for its loss making up-country buying subsidiary, SOGEPAG, but exporters and buyers say port arrivals will not be affected.
""Our cost calculations were wrong and farmers never really caught on to our new ideas,"" Pierre-Dominique Blind, spokesman for SIFCA, owners of the SOGEPAG buying subsidiary, told Reuters in an interview. ""We lost too much money and could not go on refinancing debts.""
""Purchase volumes were too small and farmers' debts became a vicious circle,"" said Blind, managing director of UCEPAG, a holding company set up by SIFCA to run SOGEPAG.
SOGEPAG's warehouses could be empty for the rest of the season after a liquidator is named this week, and SIFCA would probably take back assets it wanted, he added.
Liquidation is expected to take at least three months.
Minority 33 percent shareholder DAFCI, an Ivorian exporter, was not immediately available for comment.
UCEPAG figures show cocoa purchases of 46,000 tonnes of cocoa and 9,741 tonnes of coffee in 1995/96, but other exporters said the figure was underestimated. In 1994/95 the amounts were shown as 43,000 and 9,000 tonnes.
SOGEPAG was set up in 1991 and guaranteed farmers fixed farmgate prices when world prices dipped. It paid official reference prices while other buyers paid less, said Blind.
""Our operation was based on protection against prices going down, but prices went up after 1991,"" he said. ""The aim was to take 20 percent of the market in three years but our sales only rose by about seven percent a year.""
The total Ivorian cocoa crop in 1995/96 was about 1.2 million tonnes.
Up-country buyers said SOGEPAG had not understood buying strategy upcountry. It paid cash but sometimes three days late.
""Our strategy was wrong. Farmers preferred immediate cash in hand, even if less than our prices,"" said Blind. ""We gave prefinancing and logistical support to farmers on good terms and then they would sell to someone else.""
SOGEPAG built up the number of its sites to 17 from four at its inception.
Other exporters said SOGEPAG's closure would have no effect on the market. ""SIFCA and DAFCI will probably take control of the key assets and others will step in to buy whatever is sold,"" said one.
""We will buy some of their trucks,"" said one buyer. ""No cocoa will be left in the bush.""
SOGEPAG has 120 vehicles, mainly collection trucks and tractors it used to hire to farmers and GVCs -- farmers' cooperatives which aim to sell directly to exporters.
SIFCA's parent SIFCOM is a main distributor of Nissan vehicles.
Blind said SOGEPAG was owed 160 million CFA francs for vehicle hire at one point but only 60 million had been repaid. ""Farmers saw us as a cash cow,"" he said. ""Variable cost inflation after depreciation of the CFA also got out of hand.""
He said many modern trucks on the market were too sophisticated and expensive for farmers.
Some industry analysts said farmers had made money out of SOGEPAG but did not see why a decision had been taken to close operations at this point.
""It is a pity for the farmers.  The World Bank had just approved funding for us to give them more training,"" said Blind. ""Now they will be paid less than reference prices and many GVCs have poor little logistical expertise.""
Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24, setting farmgate cocoa prices unchanged at 320 CFA per bagged kg but delaying an announcement on guideline buyers and exporters rates.

"African robusta producers will meet discuss to export limit quotas on February 26-27 after a January world agreement in Rio de Janeiro to shore up prices, Ivory Coast's Commodities Minister told Reuters on Friday.
Gauze, who is also chairman of the Interafrican Coffee Organisation, gave no venue details but said African robusta exporters would afterwards seek to meet other producers.
""There will be a meeting to decide how to divide export limits between African producers,"" said Gauze. ""The meeting will be for two days, on February 26 and February 27,"" he added.
""We will then call on other producers for a meeting,"" he said without giving agenda details.
Gauze on February 5 called off talks in Bali with Asian robusta producers.
The world Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC) decided on January 23 to cut robusta exports by one million bags (60 kg) after low prices seen in late 1996.
The limitation was expected to be shared between African and Asian producers.
""The talks have been postponed,"" Gauze said after returning to Ivory Coast to attend cocoa sector reform with International Cocoa Organisation and donor officials.
Indonesian officials told Reuters export cut sharing between Africa and Asia had not been discussed as the Bali meeting.
Gauze said African producers would discuss how to divide Africa's export limitation share, which he said was 850,000 bags, between exporting countries.
IACO chief economist this week delined to comment on African sharing arrangements saying the decision was an internal IACO matter.
Indonesia has decided to reduce its exports by 150,000 bags in the January to June 1997 period covered by the volutary export restraint.
ACPC members are concerned that rising production from non-ACPC member such as Vietnam will undermine their own export restraint policy.
Indonesia's ACPC representative Paian Nainggolan said informal discussions had taken place after Gauze cancelled his trip. No ACPC export cut sharing cut talks took place, he said.
Ivory Coast, Africa's largest exporter, expects to produce 230,000 tonnes in 1996/97 but local quality inspectors say quality problems mean not all of it will be exportable.",0
"As Chad's odyssey to oil production from 2001 enters financing and tender stages, senior officials are asking for guarantees that benefits will trickle down to the impoverished population.
""I am afraid about the oil because the experience of other African countries shows that it is always mismanaged,"" Chad's Foreign Minister Saleh Kebzabo told Reuters in an interview.
""It will change people's mentality for the worse. No preparations have yet been made at political and management levels and there has been no public debate,"" he said.
After decades of civil strife or conflict with neighbouring Libya, Chad held its first multiparty legislative elections on January 5, marking a symbolic transition to peace.
Other political party leaders, who like Kebzabo, contested the elections, voiced similar concerns.
""We must have laws to ensure all interests are served, with Chad at the centre,"" said Lol Mahamet Choua, who draws support near the smaller Sedigi oilfield on the shores of Lake Chad.
Exxon's unit Esso Exploration and Production Chad Inc., a 40 percent-share consortium member with Shell's Chad unit (40 percent) and Elf (20 percent) in November sealed a deal with Chad on finance and legal terms for Chad's main field 350 miles (560 km) south of N'Djamena.
Doba, due on stream in 2001, is forecast to yield 900 million barrels, or 200,000-250,000 bpd over 15-20 years, at a cost of $3 billion, according to Exxon, Houston. Cheaper electricity is expected from power stations using Sedigi crude.
""There are some milestones needing to be resolved but something could happen next month,"" Exxon spokesman Ed Burwell told Reuters last week as Chad's finance minister left for discussions in Washington and officals held talks on a pipeline through Cameroon.
Chad's Gross National Product per capita income at $237 in 1995 is one of Africa's lowest. It is dependent on cotton, livestock and gum arabic revenue and badly needs foreign currency after 30 years of war since independence from France in 1960 and devaluation of the regional CFA franc in 1994.
Investors hope Moslem President Idriss Deby, once dubbed ""Cowboy of the Sands"" for lightning jeep-based warfare against Libya, can both welcome oilmen to his country -- twice the size of Texas -- and heal North-South, Moslem-Christian strife.
The consortium is nearing the end of exploration and engineering studies, despite logistics problems in the sprawling Sahel state with only 300 km (170 miles) of paved roads.
Doba's geological profile is such that horizontal flow and recovery of oil is small, meaning costly vertical well-drilling.
Most financial aspects of Doba remain unclear. ""Chadians are told nothing at all about what is going on,"" Assistant Government Secretary Saleh Makki told Reuters. ""Royalties are a closely guarded secret, but if there is no transparency people will find other ways to express themselves.""
Production slipped back from 1998 to 2001, partly due to rebel activities in southern areas led by Moise Kette. The group wants an autonomous Chrisitan region in the south where Chad's cotton, and soon oil, wealth is concentrated.
Chad buys oil from southern neighbours Nigeria and Cameroon.
""Oil has not made people's lives much better in those countries, despite United Nations figures. Our oil money should not also disappear abroad,"" former National Assembly leader and ex-prime minister Jean Bawayou Alingue told Reuters.
Compared with Chad's per capita income of $237, that for oil-producer Cameroon is $813 and Gabon -- with Elf dominating offshore oil production -- $4,400. Chad has appealed for food aid for 1997.
""There will be enough money in government coffers for them to do some smart things,"" said Louis Adande, vice-president at the Abidjan unit of Citibank, reviewing finance options for the consortium. ""But Chad is obviously still looking for stability and has an interest in promoting it.""
A private Swiss firm, Cotecna, hired to manage Chad's treasury funds, recently ended a two-year contract. Opposition parties fear political use of future revenues.
The half-desert central African state of 6.5 million has held talks with the World Bank over partial funding of a 30-inch (76 cm), 650 kilometre (404 mile), pipeline with four pumping stations to take landlocked Chad's oil to French-built refineries, and marine terminals, at Kribi port in Cameroon.
An airport for supply planes is planned for Doba along with roads to N'Djamena and 300 long-term jobs are expected.",0
"Bulk cocoa shipments from West Africa will more than double to 325,000 tonnes in 1996/97, solidifying a cost-cutting trend sparked by recent trial shipments, exporters and shippers said.
""West African shipments will reach at least 325,000 tonnes this year (1996/97),"" said one trader, with most going to large Amsterdam-based buyers. ""And that is only a start."" he added.
Bulk shipments include beans stuffed directly into containers or poured loose into ship's holds, replacing traditional stacks of 60 kg jute bags.
Ivory Coast would ship about 270,000 tonnes in bulk this year. The world's largest producer blazed the trail by shipping 120,000 tonnes in 1995/96 as bagged cocoa lost favour with large buyers, said the source.
Of this year's total, about 260,000 tonnes would be shipped for two Amsterdam-based clients out of an expected crop of 900,000 to one million tonnes, said the trader.
Less than half, about 120,000 tonnes, would be shipped loose on holds against the same tonnage for all forms of bulk shipments in 1995/96. The remainder would be leave in twenty-foot bag-lined containers packed with drying agents.
Additional shipments of about 5,000 tonnes for trials to Germany, and less for Mediterranean ports would take the total of both bulk methods to around 270,000 tonnes.
Ghana is also expected to build on small shipments with 25,000 tonnes possibly leaving in December. Volumes from Nigeria and Cameroun are widely expected to rise.
Little was shipped in bulk from other West African ports last year but shipping companies say that will change.
Dutch transporters Spliethoffe completed three successful trials from Ivory Coast in 1995/96 totalling about 10,000 tonnes followed by another 110,000 tonnes for processors Gerkens and Cacao De Zaan.
The loading and shipment methods developed then has prompted an expected 100 percent plus jump in overall regional tonnages for 1996/97, say shippers.
Shipping lines Nedlloyd, Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and Delmas (SDV) are already taking bulk cargos from forwarders SAGA and Delmas, and Ivorian exporters/forwarders Jean-Abile Gal and SIFCA.
""Each have loading systems (total of 8) in Abidjan and San Pedro (Ivory Coast's second port) but only direct users have reception facilities,"" a West Africa region shipping manager said. ""Not everyone has a 4,000 tonnes a day capacity plant with storage facilities,"" he added, referring to large processors in Amsterdam.
""In future, about  25 percent of all cocoa will leave in bulk,"" said one shipping manager, depending on the size of the reference crop
The manager of another shipper handling large volumes put the figure at 40 percent by 2000 for Ivory Coast.
""The economics are simple. What used to be shipped in four containers is now shipped in three,"" he said, or 100 tonees per six 20 foot containers.
Shipping companies had gained a 25 percent freight space saving and exporters would expect rebates in return, he said.
A typical charter on FIOS (free in and out, stowed) rates would be 55 dollars, with another 25 dollars in handling to be added depending on terms, said one shipping line.
The marginal cost of loading a container was about 3,750 CFA a tonne with 55,000 CFA for positioning a container, but labour and time savings more than compensated. Conveyor belts, silos and tip-up containers are all used for loading.
Plans to build a new bulk reception warehouse in Amsterdam unveiled by Dutch Cocoa Association (NCV) president Louis Bensdorp on Friday would encourage bulk cocoa advocates, said local exporters.",0
"Security forces in Chad have summarily executed scores of people since a November official decree sanctioned instant justice for criminals caught in the act, local human rights officials said on Friday.
A pregnant woman, streetchildren and supected thieves are among victims of public executions reported, but human rights groups fear scores of other killings were carried out secretly.
""The policy has been carried out since November. It is quite open but the total numbers killed are not,"" a charity worker who gave her name only as Marie-Odile told Reuters.
""We are called out to scenes of executions and we talk with relatives of those killed,"" she said.
Officials confirmed the shoot-at-sight decree, but refused to go on the record. Instead they cited a public statement by President Idriss Deby whose office issued the order to paramilitary gendamrie commanders nationwide.
""N'Djamena is being held hostage by real organised gangs which, when they are apprehended by the law, are systematically freed again by the justice system. After they are freed they continue to give law enforcers problems,"" Deby told a news conference after meeting rights groups on November 23.
Insecurity is a major problem in Chad, which has been gripped by internal conflict or war with Libya for more than two decades until 1990.
""Crime is a huge problem. The whole place is run by the army and bandits and roads outside N'Djamena are subject to roadblocks by robbers,"" a Western resident said.
The vast but largely desert country also borders the volatile states of Sudan and Central African Republic, with whom it is seeking a common strategy against cross border banditry.
A transport worker at a dock on Lake Chad was among victims of the shoot-to-kill order listed by the human rights groups.
""A docker accused of breaking into an empty container was executed in the market. The shooting caused one pregnant woman at the scene to miscarry under emotional shock,"" the Chadian Human Rights League (LTDH) said in a December 26 report.
A Paris-based human rights group, in its account of the executions, said a pregnant woman suspected of stealing grain in a market was shot dead on the spot by gendarmes on November 16. A boy was put in a bag and shot dead on the banks of the Chari river in similar circumstances two days earlier.
Three suspected livestock thieves were shot in public on December 26, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues told Paris daily Liberation.
A copy of the November 14 order to security forces seen by Reuters in N'Djamena read in part:
""We remind you once again that robbers must not be the object of normal procedures (of arrest). If one is caught in the act, you must immediately proceed with his physical elimination.
""Non-application of this order will result in very severe punishment including possible loss of rank and sacking from the force.""
LTDH workers say two gendarmerie officers who leaked the order were taken into custody and had not been seen since. The two, named as Job Mbaibougue and Abel Djimong were arrested on November 23 and taken to Faya Largeau prison, they said.",0
"Ivorian 1996/97 cocoa arrivals stood at around 390,000-410,000 tonnes by mid-December, after a slow start to the month, analysts and exporters say.
Exporters blamed a combination of crop profile and demand factors for the dip in December -- usually the strongest month.
The figures to December 16 were down from an estimated 540,000 tonnes by that date last year, but some analysts said a further 50,000 tonnes should be added to this year's total for comparative purposes as the season had opened three weeks late.
An averaged figure plus the 50,000 tonnes would put arrivals since October 1 at 450,000. Various sources put arrivals at San Pedro since October 1 at 130,000-140,000 tonnes with the rest going to the main port of Abidjan.
""Arrivals were slower than usual for December but in the past week arrivals have overtaken last year's (weekly) rate,"" said one exporter. ""People are completing December contracts but January will be strong,"" he added.
Subsequent arrivals up to December 22 were said by exporters to be around 50,000 tonnes per week. They expected the deficit in arrivals compared to last year to grow in December before narrowing sharply in January, when arrivals pick up again.
Difficulty in obtaining export contracts from the Caistab marketing board and problems with bean drying after rains upcountry had accentuated the usual Christmas period drop-off.
Rains had damaged bushtracks, delaying collection and raising humidity and moisture to above acceptable levels in some areas.
""We are refusing some cocoa. There is a lot more coming down now the sun is out,"" said one Abidjan-based exporter.
Drying problems and poor fermentation had raised bean humidity to 11 percent in some areas, extending both normal and machine drying times.
""Humidity levels are slipping back down from anything up to 11 percent,"" said one San Pedro-based buyer, and the guideline farmgate price of 315 CFA per kilo had on the whole been paid to growers.
Upcountry buyers visited by Reuters over Christmas had taken the chance to dry out large quantities of fresh through to greyish moist beans as a wet early December gave way to usual dry sunny weather ahead of the holiday.
""It's patchy, but sunny days are here again,"" said one buyer. ""Whatever was cut off in village stores or too wet can now be properly dried out,"" he added.
San Pedro received over 15,000 in the week from December 16, exporters there said.
Reports of smuggling to Guinea continue to surface but one Western diplomat recently returning by road from Conakry said road conditions were appalling and few covered trucks had been seen.
Large shipments in the past weeks are expected to cut into port stocks.
""Port area stocks are unclear but there are a lot of bulk shipments,"" said one exporter.",0
"Chad holds much-delayed parliamentary elections on Sunday with voters hoping that democratic reforms and oil development will bring a lasting end to sometimes bloody ethnic rivalry.
An estimated 300,000 nomads in the sprawling arid nation on the edge of the Sahara Desert started voting on Thursday, three days before the rest of the 3.5 million voters throughout the Moslem north and centre and largely Christian south.
A total of 658 candidates from 49 parties will be vying for the 125 seats in a new national assembly which will convene on March 31 when the former French colony's democratic transition finally draws to an end.
""Oil is really what is at stake. Christian and Moslem differences have calmed although Islamic fundamentalism is rising,"" one diplomat told Reuters.
Polls open from 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) to 6 p.m. (1700 GMT).
French troops, stationed in Chad under a defence pact, will help fly voting materials and the 30 international observers to far-flung polling stations.
President Idriss Deby, the former northern guerrilla leader who seized power in a French-backed coup in 1990, won a long-delayed presidential election in July against southern rival and fellow general Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue.
Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, leading member of the 27-party Republican Front coalition, starts favourite to win Sunday's election or to be able to cobble together a working majority after the poll.
Election officials expect vote counting to end by Wednesday, provisional results a week later and final results by January 25, once the appeal court has checked them. Any run-offs will be held on February 23.
Many opposition parties disputed the first-round results of the presidential poll and urged their supporters to boycott the runoff but polling passed off peacefully. The opposition are grouped in a 17-party coalition.
The capital was calm on Saturday following a peaceful campaign, which ended on December 31.
Election issues tended to be local or ethnic but diplomats said that all parties were looking for a fair distribution of any wealth from oil, which is expected to come on stream by the year 2000. Chad has about 100 ethnic groups.
""People still largely vote on local grounds and Deby is not president of all Chadians,"" former national assembly leader, Jean Alingue, another defeated presidential hopeful, told Reuters.
""Turnout will be low because people know the fraud apparatus is still in place and nothing much will change,"" he predicted.
Chad has known coups, civil war or conflict with northern neighbour Libya for much of its life from independence in 1960.
It had a 57-member interim legislature under a 1993 transitional charter. Elections were repeatedly delayed, the parliamentary poll at least twice in 1996. Election officials cited organisational delays.",0
"Light rains in Ivory Coast after a dry start to January will help mid-crop (April-Sept) cocoa crop development, particularly if they extend into February, a crop analyst said on Thursday.
""We have seen around average rain levels for January so far but a little more now and in February would help,"" another local crop analyst told Reuters.
Distribution of rains was patchy.
Most fell in central and northern cocoa and coffee areas, particularly around Man, Daloa, Yamoussoukro and Gagnoa, the data showed. Little fell in coastal areas around San Pedro and Abidjan.
""The front (associated with rain) is now over central areas,"" said one weather analyst. ""Central areas have seen a surplus for the period but southern areas are in deficit,"" he added.
One crop analyst told Reuters rains seemed to have reached most cocoa and coffee areas.
""There seem to have been good light showers in most cocoa areas,"" said the crop analyst after returning from an up-country tour. ""There is no dust on most bush tracks.""
Dry harmattan conditions from the Sahara had now retreated northwards after failing to reach southern Ivory Coast as usually expected in late-December or early January.
Exporters and crop inspectors said cocoa humidity levels remained around 8-10 percent against exportable quality of eight percent, despite drying efforts
Coffee farmers have also had drying problems but export activity remained low after shipments put by port sources at 10,492 tonnes for October to December, exporters said.
Quality inspectors said a better picture of coffee humidity and quality after rains would emerge as arrivals picked up.
The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, showed the following rainfall for the second 10 days of January in key growing areas plus the commercial capital Abidjan:
Dalao 47.5 mm, Gagnoa 7.8 mm, San Pedro 0.1 mm, Tabou 6.2 mm and Man 0 mm, Dimbokro 4.6 mm, Yamoussoukro 44.8 mm, Aidjan 6 mm, Sassandra n/a, Adiake n/a, Korhogo 0 mm.
No data were available for Adiake and Sassandra.",0
"Rains ended abruptly throughout most of Ivory Coast in the second 10 days of December, allowing crops to dry after the extended rain, upcountry buyers and weather analysts say.
Weather data showed average rain down to 8mm from about 45 mm at the start of December, with little or no rain falling at six of eight stations monitored in the 10 days to December 20.
A total of 65 mm fell compared to 400 mm at nine stations in the first 10 days of the month. Only the northern Daloa area, with 21.8 mm, and the far southwest around Tabou, with 42.5 mm, received noticeable amounts.
Around 250 mm fell in San Pedro and Tabou alone in early December during a late, small rainy season usually seen in October and November.
""The inter-tropical weather front has still not brought down Harmattan (drier conditions usually seen in early December and on through January after rains),"" said one weather analyst.
Farmers visited by Reuters over Christmas had begun drying beans but some exporters in Abidjan were rejecting moist beans, some of which had sat uncollected in villages before mud tracks solidified.
Heavy rains fell in early December, leading to deterioration of bushtracks and raising cocoa bean humidity levels to up to 11 percent, compared to exportable levels of about eight percent.
One crop analyst said before the latest figures that mid-crop (April-September) prospects would be boosted by another 20mm rain by January. Sporadic rains have fallen upcountry since December 20 but month-end rainfall figures were not immediately available.
Midcrop flowers are expected to give cherelles (small cocoa pods) as insect activity gets underway after rains end. Crop analysts will be looking for clear indications of prospects in early January.
Crop analysts see the rains as beneficial for pods still on trees as a preceding small dry season had also been late and wetting would cushion the effects of coming dry Harmattan winds.
The data, from Ivory Coast's national weather station, shows rainfall for the second 10 days of December in the following key growing areas -
Dalao 21.8mm, Gagnoa 0 mm, San Pedro 0.7 mm, Tabou 42.5 mm and Man 0 mm, Dimbokro 0 mm, Yamoussoukro 0 mm, Adiake 0 mm.",0
"Delayed export financing is slowing Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals but shipments for existing contracts will continue ahead of an imminent government decision on licences and marketing rates, exporters and shipping sources said on Friday.
""The central bank has stopped backing private lenders,"" said one exporter. ""Buying activity has slowed down in the past two days.""
No immediate figures on  latest arrivals were available on Friday.
At least one major bank has stopped financing, and exporters expect others to follow suit unless rates are published soon.
""Exporters with licences from 1995/96 and enough money are carrying on buying and shipping. November contracts are fewer than December but still have to be met,"" said one exporter.
Ivory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season on October 24 but delayed an announcemement on guideline buyer and exporter marketing rates. ""They have never been so late,"" said an exporter.
Almost no cocoa trucking activity was visible at Abidjan on Friday. But large consignments of cocoa can be seen in warehouses and total port stocks are now estimated by shippers to be over 100,000 tonnes.
One banker financing some large exporters said many of their clients had no cocoa in port and the owner of the stocks was not clear. A large shipment to Amsterdam from Ivory Coast is expected within two weeks.
""Port stocks will probably slip before cocoa arrivals pick up after licensing,"" said one exporter. ""Activity will probably pick up after November 15 when licence finances have been sorted out.""
Exporters are expecting total arrivals for November of between 150,000 and 180,000 tonnes, rising to a December peak before a slow January tail-off. Exporters' total year crop estimates pivot around 900,000 tonnes.
Shipping companies expected licences to be out by Friday but are now waiting for an announcement next week.  ""Many companies we deal with were saying licences would be out by the weekend but we have heard nothing about rates,"" said one source.
Licences are usually announced by the Ministry of Agriculture but no date has been set.
Caistab sources said this week a list of approved cocoa exporters had been drawn up by Wednesday but still had to be signed by the Minister of Commerce. The list had been expected by exporters on Wednesday.
Caistab president Yves-Marie Koissy is still in the U.S, but could return next week, said Caistab sources.
Exporters have rejected Caistab requests to them to argue for a cut in freight rates. They have also rejected a government plan to make exporters responsible for collecting buyers' unpaid income taxes.
""The Caistab is also trying to get exporters to pull down freight rates but they (exporters) are refusing to approach shipping lines,"" said another port source.
""Exporters want the rates set the same, so their rebate from the Caistab is not cut,"" the source added.
Pod counters recently up country said large quantities of cocoa were seen along roadsides and moving through warehouses.
""November arrivals will be strong as soon as the uncertainty is over,"" said one.",0
"Cocoa arrivals at Ivory Coast's ports this season could be 25 percent below last season's record 1.2 million tonne because of erratic weather and insect damage starting in July, buyers and exporters around San Pedro say.
They predict cumulative arrivals to the end of November of around 250,000 tonnes and of up to 300,000 for December.
""Mid-December to February will dip because of the rains in July,"" said one exporter in the southwestern port. ""Harvests will now be later and more prolonged, but not over 900,000 tonnes.""
Buyers said heavy July and August rains hurt flowers for December and January pods. Sunshine after August had helped the outlook for March while lighter rains, which started in early November, would boost flowering for mid-crop pods.
Widespread wilting of smaller pods was noted this week on on southwestern farms east and north of San Pedro last visited in September. Insect damage and ""black pod"" fungus had also been noticeable.
The Ivory Coast has slated 950,000 tonnes for its total 1996/97 output after private forecaster estimates of 850-900,000 for the main crop alone. The 1995/96 season hit a 1.2 million tonnes record after a higher than expected mid-crop of 200,000 tonnes.
But one San Pedro exporter said, ""There will be no more than 900,000 tonnes for the whole year. It could have been better but pod deterioration, insects and maybe even the trees' natural cycle have had an effect.""
Local buyers and other exporters in the southwest agree, some putting the output at even less, but they say mid-crop predictions are unreliable.
Few flowers and pods were seen on coastal farms and little cocoa was drying along roadsides. Tree pods and village stores were more plentiful in productive Meadji and Soubre areas.
Exporters and buyers in the southwest now matching cocoa arrivals data with last season's say volumes are down, with humidity higher at 8-10 percent and smaller bean sizes of between 93 and 100 per 100 grammes, against 85-90 last year.
""There is less cocoa than last year. It takes twice as long to fill a truck driving around the bush and it needs a lot of drying,"" said a buyer in Sassandra. Buyers elsewhere agreed.
Cumulative arrivals to end-November could be 250,000 tonnes, the sources said. One put registered cumulative arrivals at 213,000 to November 24, with 85,000 arriving in the week up to then. November arrivals last year topped 300,000.
Buyers and exporters foresee arrivals of around 250,000- 300,000 for December against about 400,000 in 1995/96.
A San Pedro exporters' agent said he had taken in 22,800 tonnes of cocoa this season with 10,000 still in stores and room for 25,000 more. Many San Pedro warehouses were full this time last year.
Another said their cumulative year-on arrivals were down 15 percent at November 24 and expected the gap to widen in December.
San Pedro's largest port handler expects up to 30 percent less volume this year and said arrivals to November 17 totalled 70,000 tonnes. The port expects to handle a third of this year's crop.
Cocoa quality is good but some mouldy, moist and deteriorated beans were being mixed in the rush to supply exporters.
""Some buyers can charge higher prices as export contracts have been sold up to March and have to be met,"" said one. Mould levels were around four percent, he added.
Some buyers have supplied farmers with insecticides and say dry Harmattan weather moving southwards will help drying. One 15-tonne capacity dryer was out of action after a fire at a San Pedro plant on Saturday.
Exporters said they now accept the 1996/97 list of marketing prices set by the government this month after a late start to the season. But they said the Caistab marketing board had not altered its auctioning system to prevent overbidding.
Smaller exporters say some people have been laid off until March as they cannot match prices bid over opening calls.
""About 750,000 tonnes have been sold to highest bidders but the Caistab has not sold the 15 percent it retains. Maybe they are waiting for higher world prices,"" one exporter said.
A San Pedro factory said it aimed to process 25-30,000 tonnes of cocoa this year.",0
"Delegates to Ivory Coast's cocoa Consultative Committee focused on bean quality and marketing on Thursday, the mid-point of their review of industry reforms.
""I would prefer to get down to talking about cocoa quality and continuity of supply,"" Cacao Barry managing director Alain Leblond said before the second day of the talks, which end on Friday.
Ivory Coast's Consultative Committee, a tripartite group of Ivorian, industry and donor officials, was set up in 1996 to monitor cocoa sector reforms since 1990.
After opening the talks on Wednesday, International Cocoa Organization Chief Executive Edouard Kouame said changes must benefit farmers and other local players.
""At the same time the legitimate interests of others in the sector must be safeguarded,"" he added, referring to foreign traders, cocoa butter manufacturers, and chocolate and confectionary industries.
An electronic export contract auction set up in May 1996 to increase market transparency is widely seen as encouraging overbidding and concentrating export contracts in a few hands.
Local exporters, allocated 85 percent of contracts, and foreign traders, allocated 15 percent, have complained they cannot win export contracts at favourable prices.
""The question needs to be asked how some people can bid as much as they have (been bidding),"" Cocoa Association of London Chief Executive Philip Sigley told Reuters.
Industry concerns have been voiced about quality since the state marketing monopoly was ended.
""Quality has to do with liberalisation and the auction system,"" Netherlands Cocoa Association Managing Director Louis Bensdorp told Reuters. ""The lack of quality checks is the major problem. That and the second thing, the education of farmers.""
Industry watchers are wondering whether strong arrivals so far in 1996/97 means that output will rival the 1995/96 (Oct-Sept) record of 1.2 million tonnes.
""There is a very good crop coming in which suggests that last year was not a fluke of nature,"" said Bensdorp.
Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze declined to confirm whether buoyant cocoa arrivals would mean an adjustment of the Caistab state marketing board's 1996/97 production forecast of 950,000 tonnes. Industry forecasts are increasingly putting total output at more than one million tonnes.
Industry delegates said mid-crop forecasts for April to September had not yet been finalised.
""It is still too early to talk about the mid-crop but it tends to be bigger and bigger,"" said Bensdorp.
Ivory Coast wants to process 50 percent of its output by 2000 to shore up world prices and add value the cocoa sector's output.
At least two cocoa processors have expressed interest in building factories in Ivory Coast.",0
"Ivory Coast's 1996/97 coffee crop is set to return to the 250-300,000-tonne levels seen before farmers neglected their trees in the early 1990s, exporters and up-country buyers say.
Coffee output in 1995/96 was around 180,000 tonnes and experts see the increase as part of a new good-moderate-weak cycle that tends to dominate the sector.
""It is a very good crop although there are some quality problems,"" one San Pedro exporter told Reuters.
""I think the crop will be at least 250,000 tonnes,"" said a large buyer visited in the coffee-rich areas around Man and Vavoua. ""Exporters are not yet buying and the world price is still very low.""
Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan last week said the crop would exceed 200,000 tonnes after a 32 billion CFA franc rehabilitation plan, favourable weather and better maintenance.
The government set a higher 1995/96 price to encourage production, but reference farmgate coffee prices were set lower this year to lessen government subsidisation of the sector.
Ivory Coast slashed its 1996/97 farmgate price to 500 CFA from 700 CFA for unhulled green coffee cherries, with lower prices for hulled cherries.
Most buyers and exporters visited by Reuters in a tour this week have not yet seen a full 1996/97 marketing list detailing their commissions, but they said they would have to accept rates shown in a copy obtained by Reuters.
""Buyers will lose out on commission,"" said one. Exporters said operations would go ahead in spite of some objections.
The new marketing season opened on November 14, delayed from early October.
Coffee marketing would get underway from mid-December as usual after cocoa harvests tail off, San Pedro exporters said.
""Most coffee is now held in village stores and the weather means drying and sorting will take more time,"" said one buyer.
Good yields meant some farmers had stripped ripe and unripe beans and mixed them together, they said.
Large amounts of coffee, both green and ripe red cherries, were this week seen by Reuters drying, some mixed together, along roadsides and in bush clearings, particularly in the north. Green cherries are bought at discounted prices.
Well-managed plantations visited were harvesting once a month but many trees around villages showed signs of unselective stripping, buyers said.
""Farmers take less care when quantities rise so we will have to consider the price,"" said a Daloa buyer. ""Exporters have not put in orders yet so we are not buying.""
One Abidjan-based exporter who went up-country this week also said quality was down. ""It is pretty bad in some places but the quantities are excellent,"" he said.
One crop analyst recently forecast 1996/97 production at 230,000 tonnes but most buyers and exporters said the figure was too low. Some up-country buyers said output could even be higher than 250,000 tonnes.
One expected 300,000 tonnes this year but most estimates put 1996/97 yields at one-third higher than the previous season, matching expected percentage drops in cocoa output.
A mild dry season favouring flowering and the natural production cycle of coffee trees had lifted the crop from a relatively poor 180,000 tonnes range in 1995/96, said Jean Toullec, a plantation manager in Gagnoa.
""I think 250,000 tonnes is possible as farms are being well maintained,"" he said. ""We are seeing 600 kg of coffee per hectare each harvest instead of 450.""",0
"Shipments of cocoa from Ivory Coast's two main ports are estimated to have risen to around 120,000 tonnes by end-November but official figures would not be ready until later this month, shippers and exporters said.
""About 120-130,000 tonnes sounds right,"" said one. Others agreed and said Abidjan and San Pedro port stocks had risen over the past week.
Official statistics for October and November are not yet available but about 100,000 tonnes had been exported by the same date in 1995/96. Shipments then had been delayed in a shipping freight rate dispute, making year-on comparisons difficult.
Under 10,000 tonnes were exported in October 1996 and volumes for this year are expected to be small as the marketing season opened over two weeks later than usual on October 24.
Exporters said arrivals in 1996/97 had reached 285,000 tonnes by end-November. Some put the figure at closer to 300,000.
""That would leave stocks of around 150,000 tonnes, which sounds a bit high,"" said one. But large shipments in early December would have already cut into that volume, he added.
Shippers looking ahead expected arrivals to slacken from mid-December to end-January before a steady flow until the end of March.
""There's also plenty of coffee to deal with this year. Cocoa should take off again in February and March,"" said one exporter. ""There's not much demand and plenty of stocks in Europe.""
Cocoa crop analysts said an extension of light rains well into December would greatly improve mid-crop prospects. Drying could slow arrivals but only marginally. Shipments would rise again from February.
""The trees are flushing now and large pods have been taken off. That gives trees more reserves for flowering,"" said one.
Peak 1996/97 harvesting is expected in late December and early January, boosting early February arrivals for shipments to meet benchmark March contracts.
Harvested cocoa usually takes about 21-27 days to reach ports for shipment, after fermenting, drying, sorting, bagging and transport.
""The year will certainly be drawn out until March,"" he said.
Mid-crop volumes from March onwards still unpredictable but will be favoured by continuing light rains.
Some shipping freight rate elements were still under discussion this week but those set on October 24 in the 1996/87 Caistab marketing agency price list were largely accepted. No delays to shipments were expected, said exporters.
Some exporters said they had negotiated cheaper rates for some destinations than last year, especially for U.S.-bound cargo, as premiums on space had dropped with arrivals volumes down.",0
"Shipments of cocoa from Ivory Coast's main port of Abidjan are matching arrivals, leaving intact a standing stock of about 90,000 tonnes reported at the end of October, shipping sources said on Tuesday.
""The majority of transporters are shipping cocoa but some are still cautious as freight rates have not been agreed,"" one port source told Reuters. ""Total stocks have not really changed since last week,"" he added.
Port sources said arrivals seemed to be picking up with increasing numbers of trucks arriving.
Shipping companies and exporters last week said delays in issuing freight rates and export licences had blocked some cocoa at Abidjan. Exporters now expect 1996/97 export licences to be issued this week.
""The Caistab (marketing board) told me licences would be out this week"" said one exporter. ""Some exporters have decided to wait for their licences and bank finances before buying anything but some are going ahead.""
Shipping companies say they would continue shipping at the 1995/96 reference freight rates agreed with the Caistab last November.
Shipments at the start of the 1995/96 cocoa marketing season were delayed from early October to mid-November when shipping companies refused to cut their freight rates by 25 percent as requested by the Caistab. A cut of seven percent was evenutally agreed.
""So far we have avoided a repeat. Shipments have carried on so far but we will just wait see what happens,"" said one port source.
Rates for this year are widely expected to remain unchanged.
Shipping companies have been asked by government agencies to submit detailed information on freight rates and projected volumes for next year but say prices are confidential business information.
Caistab spokesmen were not immediately available for comment and no date has been set for fixing the reference freight rates for the 1996/97 cocoa season.",0
"A prolonged dry spell In Ivory Coast has stretched into the small rainy season, but its impact on mid-crop cocoa pod setting and main crop growth may not be clearer until later this year, crop and weather analysts said on Wednesday.
""The weather is very, very strange. We have a mixture of harmattan (hot, dry) conditions in some places but light rains nearby,"" said one crop analyst. ""Pod setting and progression could be affected. It just depends on rains before December as the front passes,"" he added.
Weather analysts said the front that usually heads southwards in September, giving Ivory coast a light rainy season between September and December, had finally moved south over the weekend. But rains were still far below average.
""It is now over Dimbokro (seventh northern parallel) but rains are well over a month late. So far we have not had a small rainy season,"" said one weather analyst.
Weather data showed less than 50 percent of average October rains fell in Ivory Coast. Data for early November were not available to build a clear picture of the overall rainfall pattern in early November, said analysts.
""Flowering and soil moisture vary greatly between regions but cherelle (early pod) setting should be clearer later in November,"" said a crop analyst who recently toured Ivorian farms.
Up-country buyers around Daloa told Reuters intermittent rains had started in the centre-west cocoa region but more rain was needed for late main and early mid-crop development.
Ivory Coast opened its 1996/97 cocoa marketing season late on October 24 after rain deluges in July and August. Bean moisture was no longer a problem, they said.
""Now there is a nice mixture of rain and sun but we need more rain up to the end of the year to avoid small mid-crop bean sizes,"" said one buyer. Beans sizes of over 110 per 100 grammes are not considered to be of export quality.
Crop analysts said soil moisture levels were low in some areas and could affect pod sizes if sunny weather continued. One crop analyst told Reuters he had only seen rain on two out of his 10 days of treking around the whole cocoa belt.
Official weather data showed average or above rains in Man and Gagnoa, but rain deficits elsewhere, particularly south of Gagnoa, around Sassandra, Abidjan and Adiake.
Sunny conditions had prevailed in the south as monsoon air was at higher altitudes south of Gagnoa than usual, said the weather analyst.
""The sun is burning off low clouds,"" he said.
Elsewhere, one crop analyst said the danger in Ghana of blackpod, a fungus hitting cocoa pods in prolonged cool and damp spells, had gone after regional attacks in September. Rains there had been heavier than in Ivory Coast.",0
"Chad held much-delayed multi-party parliamentary elections on Sunday but there was little enthusiasm in the sprawling and volatile African nation for its fourth round of voting in less than a year.
Some polling stations in the capital opened late as voting materials were not ready for the scheduled 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) start. Few queues formed in the shimmering heat of the day and those that did were small.
Some opposition candidates denounced incidents of fraud but the 30 or so international observers reserved judgment and there were no immediate reports of electoral unrest in the majority Moslem nation with a lively southern Christian minority.
President Idriss Deby, the former northern guerrilla leader who seized power in a French-backed coup in 1990, paid tribute to Chad's democratic progress after voting in the capital.
""We have made a non-negligible step in the democratic process set up in 1990,"" he told reporters.
Others took a different view. ""Turnout will be low because people know the fraud apparatus is still in place and nothing much will change,"" said former national assembly leader Jean Bawoyeu Alingue, a defeated presidential hopeful.
More than 650 candidates from 49 parties contested the 125 seats in the national assembly, which will convene on March 31 to end the former French colony's transition to democracy.
Chad has known coups, civil war or conflict with northern neighbour Libya for much of its life from independence in 1960.
After repeated electoral delays, Deby won a multi-party presidential election in July after a run-off against southern rival and fellow general Wadal Abdelkader Kamougue.
Almost 68 percent of voters took part in the first round of that poll, which followed a March constitutional referendum. Voter interest tailed off in the second round.
A total of 3.5 million people were eligible to vote on Sunday in the nation on the fringes of the Sahara Desert. An estimated 300,000 nomads started voting on Thursday.
Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, leading member of the 27-party Republican Front coalition, started favourite to win or to be able to cobble together a working majority after the poll.
The opposition, which called a boycott of the presidential runoff alleging first-round fraud, has a 17-party coalition.
Election issues tended to be local or ethnic but diplomats said that all parties were looking for a fair distribution of any wealth from oil, which is expected to come on stream by the year 2000. Chad has about 100 ethnic groups.
""Oil is really what is at stake. Christian and Moslem differences have calmed,"" one diplomat said.
""It does not take much to make people feel better off,"" Alingue said. ""We don't want to see the money vanish abroad.""
Polls were to close at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT). Election officials expected provisional results within 10 days and final results by January 25, once the appeal court had checked them. Any run-offs will be held on February 23.",0
"Ivory Coast 1996/97 cocoa marketing season began on Thursday with the farm-gate price unchanged, the export tax lower, but confusion over freight rates.
Agriculture Minister Lambert Kouassi Konan told a news conference late on Wednesday that the farm-gate price would remain at 320 CFA francs per bagged kilo.  
Kouassi Konan, whose comments were broadcast on Ivorian state television on Thursday, said the Droit Unique de Sortie (DUS) export tax would be cut from 160 CFA francs to 150.
""To maintain the price, the government itself had to agree to a sacrifice of about 10 billion CFA francs, through the lowering of the Driot Unique de Sorti for cocoa,"" he said.
""If we had not made this cut we would have had to touch the price. The head of state insisted that the price of 320 CFA be maintained for our producers.""
Exporters had been expecting no significant price change.
Shipowners spoke of disagreements with officials over an indicative freight rate for 1996/97.
The Office Ivoirien de Chargeurs had requested detailed information on proposed freight rates on shipments for 1996/97, they said.
""We cannot give that kind of information now that markets have been liberalised. This is a part of our business strategy,"" one said.
""Normally (the Ivorian shipping industry forum) FEDERMAR would organise a meeting to discuss matters but we have been waiting.""
Kouassi Konan said the government had approved on Wednesday without amendment a decision taken by the Caisse de Stabilisation marketing board on the campaign.
Noting that the 1995/96 campaign was ending on Wednesday, he added, ""As a result, remaining stocks must be declared to the Caistab.""  
The opening of the season had been delayed by about three weeks. The government had given no explanation but some exporters linked the delay to the appointment only last month of new Caistab head Yves-Marie Koissy.
Koissy, who previously worked for the International Monetary Fund in Washington, has formally taken over but is not expected back in Ivory Coast until mid-November.
The 1995/96 season produced a record of around 1.2 million tonnes but a dispute over shipping rates blocked exports from early October to mid-November.
Export financers say bank liquidity was good with interest rates down on last year after Ivory Coast repaid some external debt.
""When exporters present their licences and backing contracts we can go ahead. Export licensing should be no problem,"" said an international banker.
Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze, speaking on the sidelines of a two-day ministerial review in Gabon of the 1993 International Cocoa Agreement, said on Monday that Ivory Coast's 1996/97 cocoa production would be between 900,000 and 950,000 tonnes.

"Ivory Coast will only market its midcrop cocoa (April-Sept) if world price levels are right, Ivory Coast Commodities Minister Guy-Alain Gauze said on Friday after a three-day cocoa sector review.
""We will market the midcrop if prices are right,"" he told Reuters at the end of a Consultative Committee cocoa review with International Cocoa Organisation, industry, donor and Ivorian officials.  
Cocoa stocks around Ivorian ports in January filled warehouses to a capacity estimated by trade sources to be close to 400,000 tonnes.
Cocoa futures in London LIFFE terminal market trading slumped to 18-month lows on February 6. May contracts were trading at 871 stg but by Friday's close had edged up to 886 stg after an afternoon high of 893 stg.
Traders noted slowing origin selling activity.
Ivory Coast's midcrop is usually of poorer quality than main crop cocoa, tempting some buyers to mix it in with main crop cocoa to get a better price. Industry buyers say this undermines quality.
The meeting of Ivory Coast's cocoa Consultative Committee reviewed sector reforms ranging from quality, export contract auction rules, security of supply for buyers and farmgate prices paid to farmers.
Industry delegates said they wanted better quality controls put in place after market liberalisation, separate marketing of good and bad grades of cocoa and rules to prevent overbidding at auctioning of export contracts.
Ivory Coast aims by the year 2000 to process 50 percent of an annual cocoa output at home and wants to stabilise its production at 900,000 tonnes.
Midcrop forecasts for 1996/97 are still not clear as flower survival rates after dry weather have not been assessed.
Pod counters said initial prospects seemed good after early pod setting on hybrid trees in south-west Ivorian plantations around San Pedro.
Ivory Coast produced an unexpectedly large 200,000 tonne midcrop in a record 1995/96 season of 1.2 million tonnes.
""It would be unwise for the government to interfere in a crop of this size,"" said one industry delegate. ""The government has said in the past it would withold midcrop and has then used it.""",0
"With Chairman Jack Smith behind the wheel of a shiny red EV1, General Motors Corp. rolled its first electric vehicle out of the plant Thursday, marking what it dubbed the start of a new era in the auto industry.
The car was loaded on the back of an auto-hauling truck at the Lansing Craft Centre that will take it on the first leg of its journey to the West Coast. The cars will go on sale Dec. 5 at 26 Saturn dealerships in Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.
""When they look back on the next 100 years of the evolution of the automobile, they will agree that this car was the first in a new generation of vehicles that redefined the limits of technology and efficiency,"" Smith said during the drive-away ceremony.
GM spent $350 million and more than six years to develop the two-passenger, sleek-looking coupe. The car is the first and only GM vehicle to carry a GM badge, instead of a name from one of its other seven divisions.
While other automakers have developed and are selling electrically powered vehicles, GM says the EV1 is the first vehicle to be designed from the ground up as an electric car.
In his remarks, Smith called the EV1 ""the most technologically advanced vehicle platform in the world,"" incorporating 23 new patents.
The EV1 is powered by 26 12-volt lead-acid batteries. It can travel up to 90 miles before it needs recharging. The fully equipped EV1 comes with standard features, including air conditioning, dual air bags, anti-lock brakes, power windows and door locks. It can go from 0 to 60 mph in less than nine seconds, and has a top speed of 80 mph.
GM announced in October that it will sell the EV1 through a 36-month lease at a sticker price of $33,995. Buyers who receive a $5,000 credit from the state of California will be able to lease an EV1 for $480 a month. Monthly payments without the credit would be $640. The cost does not include a wall-mounted charger, which sells for about $2,000.
Production of the EV1 began at the Lansing Craft Centre in August. GM officials will not discuss how many EV1s they intend to sell or produce annually, although the Lansing facility has the capacity to make about 2,000 of the vehicles annually.
So far, Saturn has received more than 1,000 calls from potential buyers on a toll-free line, said Joe Kennedy, vice president of sales and marketing for the division. Of that, Saturn estimates about 250 are ""serious"" buyers.
Talking to reporters after the ceremony, Smith said GM viewed the electric vehicle market as a long-term programme. He again would not say when the EV1 will turn a profit for GM.
""Our effort is to make the programme over time to be a business,"" he said. ""The niche is small to start, but it will grow.""
Kennedy said the initial focus is not on volume but on generating a positive shopping, buying and ownership experience. He said the company will remain flexible in its production and sales plans to adjust to demand.
""This is a totally new market, and we don't know what the demand will be on any given month of year,"" he said, noting that Saturn has 13 EV1 specialists who have completed two months of special sales training.",0
"Chrysler Corp. said Monday it was exploring the possibilty of extending its car production agreement with Mitsubishi Motors Corp., reversing a trend toward cutting ties with the Japanese automaker.
""We are discussing the possibility with them, but we haven't reached any conclusions or any decisions yet,"" said Chrysler spokeswoman Shawn Williams.
Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America Inc., the company's U.S. subsidiary, currently builds the Dodge Avenger, Chrysler Sebring and Eagle Talon coupes at its assembly plant in Normal, Ill.
That agreement is set to expire after the 1999 model year. Chrysler executives have suggested in the past they want to phase out the automaker's production arrangement with Mitsubishi.
Richard Recchia, chief operating officer of Mitsubishi's U.S. unit, said in October 1995 the future relationship between the two companies would likely be based more on a partnership of components and engineering exchanges instead of complete products.
That is apparently changing.
Automotive News, a weekly trade publication, reported Monday that Chrysler Executive Vice President Thomas Gale took a team of executives to Tokyo in November to meet with Mitsubishi officials about extending the current contract through 2004.
Williams would not comment on the meeting. Gail O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Mitsubishi's Normal plant, said discussions with Chrysler have been continuing, with Mitsubishi considering numerous options.
""Talks have been ongoing, which is totally understandable based on the fact that the contract is coming up,"" she said. Analysts said it would make sense for Chrysler to continue to use Mitsubishi as a production partner.
Since coupe sales have fallen off in recent years, Chrysler could use its own manufacturing resources to build products where it has a greater competitive edge, such as sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an industry consultant in Farmington Hills, Mich.
""This way they can steer development dollars to some of their other platforms,"" he said.
Moreover, if Chrysler were to move Avenger and Sebring coupe production out of the Normal plant, it would most likely have to convert its plant in Toluca, Mexico, which currently builds the popular Sebring convertible, Neon, Cirrus and Stratus cars, analysts have said.
Robinet also noted that Mitsubishi would benfit from keeping Chrysler as a production customer. Although the Normal plant has capacity to make at least 240,000 vehicles a year, this year it is only expected to make 184,000 units, he said. Next year, the plant is forecast to produce 175,000 units.
In addition to the Avenger, Sebring and Talon, the plant makes the Galant sedan and Eclipse coupes for Mitsubishi.
According to Automotive News, Chrysler's products have accounted for 45 percent of the 177,707 units produced through November.
Chrysler was a 50-50 partner with Mitsubishi when the Normal plant, originally called Diamond Star Motors, was founded in 1985. In 1993, Chrysler sold its ownership stake back to Mitsubishi.
Last year, Chrysler said it would drop the Dodge Stealth sports car from its 1996 model year line up because of slumping sales. Mitsubishi made the Stealth and imported it from Japan. The two companies continue to supply each other with engines.",0
"General Motors Corp., facing a rancorous strike by its Canadian workers, Tuesday reported a $1.3 billion third-quarter profit that was boosted by strong automotive results and an unsually low income tax rate.
The world's largest automaker said the combined net income of its North American Automotive Operations and its Delphi Automotive Systems parts businesses was $515 million. A year ago, the operations had a combined loss of $93 million, while the parent company posted a profit of $396.7 million.
Increased volume and favourable currency exchange rates helped GM to nearly triple its international operations profits to $323 million from $111 million a year ago.
""The third quarter results from continuing operations clearly show momentum as we continue to rebuild our strength in North America and grow our business in key international markets throughout the world,"" GM Chairman John Smith said in a statement.
The earnings, equal to $1.57 a share, compared with a profit of 39 cents a share from continuing operations. They do not include results from Electronic Data Systems Corp, which GM spun off in June. Revenues climbed to $39.1 billion from $35.3 billion in the 1995 period.
Contributing to profits was $565 million in one-time favourable items. GM recorded a $253 million after-tax gain from a reduction in the reserve to pay for plant closings, thanks to its decision to use its Wilmington, Del., facility to assemble new Saturn vehicles.
Also, GM's effective income tax rate was 2.8 percent, adding another $312 million, as the company took advantage of several tax credits, including a reinstatement of research and experimentation credits for the last half of 1996.
GM Chief Financial Officer Michael Losh told reporters during a conference call that rate is expected to return to the 27 percent range in the fourth quarter.
As it has all year, GM continued to add to its growing cash account in the third period, contributing another $1.5 billion to bring its total cash balance to $14.5 billion at the end of the quarter.
Because GM has previously set its cash goal at $13 billion, Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, believes the GM board will return some of that money to shareholders.
""I thought it was a pretty decent quarter,"" he said. ""I have a lot more confidence that they are going to raise the dividend and announce a share repurchase programme.""
Glantz said the annual dividend could go to $2.00 a share from the current rate of $1.60 at the next board meeting Nov. 4. By the end of 1997, he said GM may have in place a $3 billion share repurchase programme.
GM's third quarter net profit margin from continuing operations rose to 3.7 percent from 1.3 percent. Smith said that was good news, but noted the company still has a ways to go before it reaches its average annual profit margin goal of 5 percent over an auto business cycle.
""We still have our work cut out to improve margin performance,"" he said.
GM delivered more vehicles worldwide in the third quarter -- 2,085,000 vs. 2,060,000 -- but its global market share slipped to 16.1 percent from 16.9 percent.
The company also lost share in the U.S. car and truck market, finishing the quarter with 30.4 percent compared with 32.2 percent. GM delivered 1,182,000 vehicles in the United States during the quarter, down from 1,235,000.
But CFO Losh said the overall volume increase represented good news for the company, and was a sign there is demand for the bevy of new models it is launching.
""It's volume that drives earnings, not market share, per say,"" he said.
Another positive sign was the pace of new-model launches, said Losh. Production of full-size vans at Wentzvile, Mo., and Saturn coupes in Spring Hill, Tenn., have reached full line speed, and other plants are on schedule.
GM is in the midst of launching 15 new cars and trucks. In the third quarter, the company had nine plants actively involved in changeovers. Losh said that is the most it expects to have in a given quarter, adding GM will have seven in changeovers in the fourth quarter.
However, one of those nine plants is a facility in Oshawa, Ontario, which is the target of a strike by Canadian Auto Workers. Losh declined to say how much the strike will set back the new model launch there.
Losh also declined to comment on status of talks between both the CAW and United Auto Workers. About 26,000 CAW members began walking off the job Oct. 3 over the issue of outsourcing -- the use of outside contractors. GM also has yet to reach a new labour pact with the UAW.
On Tuesday, the number of U.S. workers idled by the strike rose to 10,297 from 5,911 on Monday.",0
"Ford Motor Co. on Friday became the second of the U.S. Big Three automakers to align itself with the emerging auto superstore trend by announcing a new agreement with Republic Industries Inc., the parent company of AutoNation USA.
Under the agreement, AutoNation can submit proposals to acquire existing Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealerships. The pact also covers areas Ford may want a dealership where it does not currently have one.
The move could have implications for the future of Ohio-based Mullinax Management, one of the largest dealer groups in the country, which is reported to be in merger talks with AutoNation.
Ford spokesman John Ochs said Ford has not sold any dealerships to AutoNation. A spokesman for Mullinax, based in Amherst, Ohio, could not be reached for comment.
Mullinax, which owns several large Ford dealerships, was the 11th largest dealer group in the country, based on its 1995 retail unit sales of 20,374 cars and trucks, according to industry trade publication Automotive News.
Last month, published reports began to surface on talks between Mullinax and AutoNation. The growing auto superstore chain was founded by Wayne Huizenga, who transformed Blockbuster Video into a multibillion-dollar business and owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team.
Ford's deal with Republic is a ""framework agreement"" that opens the door for AutoNation to submit individual proposals, Ochs said. In a statement, Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said the automaker believed private entrepreneurs with local community ties will continue to be the ""backbone"" of its franchise system.
""However, there will continue to be developments in the industry relating to other types of dealership ownership and distribution methods,"" he said. ""We are working diligently to ensure that the new operators fit into our franchise system.""
That is a change from last February, when Ford Chairman Alex Trotman told the National Automotible Dealers Association it had no plans to offer a new-car franchise to an auto superstore.
A year ago, Chrysler Corp. announced it would grant a new-car franchise to CarMax Auto Superstore in Norcross, Ga. CarMax is owned by consumer electronics giant Circuit City Stores Inc..
The move sent a shockwave through the traditional auto dealer industry, which had already been warily watching the growth of chains such as CarMax and AutoNation in the used-car segment of the business.
The new superstores quickly have become popular with consumers because they offer large numbers of newer used cars at haggle-free prices in a pressure-free environment.
The Ford announcement signals the superstores will continue to build a presence in the new-car business, analysts said. ""That's big news,"" said William Sawyer, vice president of sales in the Detroit office of Polk, a marketing research firm. ""It's definitely a change for Ford.""
The move is also noteworthy, he said, because Ford has traditionally been opposed to publicly traded companies owning its franchises.
General Motors Corp. is the last of the Big Three to not have any franchise agreements with an auto superstore. GM spokesman Edward Lechtzin said the automaker was not opposed to the concept and has held talks with those groups in the past.
""We've held discussions. We'll continue to hold discussions. If one of them wants to purchase a GM dealership, we'll review it,"" he said.",0
"General Motors Corp, battling to avoid a second strike by assembly and parts workers this month, said it was hopeful a new labor contract could be reached before an extension deadline at midnight on Sunday.
Speaking to reporters gathered at GM's headquarters here, GM spokesman Chuck Licari said GM and the United Auto Workers were still working to resolve difficult and complex issues.
""GM remains hopeful an agreement can be reached before the UAW's termination of the current 1993 national agreement at 11:59 p.m. (0459 GMT) tonight,"" said Licari.
At stake is a new labor agreement for GM's 215,000 hourly UAW workers. GM employs more than half of the approximately 390,000 UAW members who work at Detroit's Big Three automakers. It is the only one of the Big Three to not have a new three-year labor contract.
UAW spokesman Frank Joyce declined to comment on the talks. UAW President Stephen Yokich said on Friday that he was not optimistic a deal could be reached by the deadline. In a sign an agreement might not be reached tonight, Licari said GM Chairman Jack Smith was not at the automaker's headquarters, although he was in touch with negotiators.
Both Ford Motor Co Chairman Alex Trotman and Chrysler Corp Chairman Robert Eaton were present for the final stages of their company's negotiations and appeared at press conferences announcing a deal.
Bargainers for UAW and GM resumed Sunday morning after they adjourned Saturday evening. Analysts speculated that negotiators could be wrangling over contract language that would dictate how many workers GM would have to guarantee jobs.
Bowing to UAW concerns over job security, both Ford and Chrysler have agreed to new contracts that promise to keep 95 percent of their current UAW hourly workforces except in the event of a severe industry downturn.
""I think if there's a sticking point that may be it,"" said Dale Brickner, a labor expert at the Michigan State University. ""GM may be pushing to get that figure farther down than the UAW may be comfortable living with.""
GM, the least efficient U.S. automaker, is trying to shed 12 unprofitable parts plants, and wants to exclude certain component facilities from the employment guarantee, including a door hardware plant in Flint, Mich., and an interior trim plant in Livonia, Mich.
In settling a 20-day strike by the Canadian Auto Workers union last week, GM was able to secure a deal that included the sale of two parts plants and flexibility to outsource more products.
Yokich has not said what he will do after once the contract extension expires at midnight Sunday. He set the deadline on Friday, but did not actually threaten a strike. Workers have been told to stay on the job until they hear otherwise.
However, there was speculation Sunday the UAW could mount a plant-specific strike if not enough progress had been made by the deadline. By hitting light truck plants such as the sport/utility facility in Janesville, Wis., the union could hurt the sale of some of GM's most profitable products at a time it is trying to bounce back from the Canadian strike.
GM's U.S. operations continue to respond to the strike by 26,000 CAW workers. The more than 6,600 UAW members at GM's Buick City complex have been told not to report Monday. At the same time, GM is running radio ads telling first-shift workers at its Hamtramck assembly plant to report to work Monday.",0
"Chrysler Corp. Tuesday reported brisk sales of minivans and pickup trucks for August, pushing total U.S. sales for the automaker up 9 percent on a daily selling basis to 186,306.
The August total broke a company record for the month of 176,184 set in 1989.
Sales of light trucks, including popular Ram pickups and four-door minivans were 127,870, a 16.7 percent jump that marked the 11th consecutive month of rising light truck sales.
Domestically produced car sales came in weaker than some analysts had expected, falling 2 percent to 58,255 units.
Chrysler's strong light truck sales were helped by incentives on some Jeep sport utility models. Grand Cherokee sales rose 42 percent; Cherokee was up 52 percent; and Wrangler sales shot up 59 percent.
Total pickup sales were held back somewhat by low supplies of the Dakota, which is undergoing a model changeover. Dealers have a 35-day supply of the compact pickups -- about half of what the industry considers to be ideal.
Chrysler executives said they did not expect significant volumes of the new Dakotas to be available until October.
Steven Torok, executive director of sales and marketing operations, said Chrysler was not concerned about the slide in car sales. Total car sales were down 4 percent from August 1995, and off 24 percent from July.
August is often a seasonally weaker month than July, Torok said. Also, declines in the Dodge Stratus and Neon were partly attributable to model-year changeovers.
""Frankly, we saw our cars starting to firm up as the month went on, and we think we'll have a pretty good month in September,"" said Torok, adding September car sales will likely surpass those of August.
Torok said the No. 3 automaker was pleased with the breadth of its sales performance.
""What we see is a very even, consistent demand pattern,"" he said. ""Consumer sentiment seems to be not euphoric but consistent.""
Although car sales were slightly weaker, PaineWebber analyst Michael Ward said Chrysler's total numbers were still respectable because it was up against a strong year-ago performance.
Chrysler was the only one of the major automakers to report monthly sales on Tuesday. General Motors Corp. is scheduled to repoort sales Wednesday. Ward predicted it will post sales that are 4 percent to 5 percent below last year, with light trucks again offsetting weak car numbers.
Also on Tuesday, Subaru of America, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries, reported U.S. sales up 18 percent to 10,361. Volvo Cars of North America, a unit of AB Volvo had August sales of 7,349, down almost 1 percent.",0
"Chrysler Corp. said Thursday it expected strong December sales results to cap off a record year for the automaker, with total 1996 car and truck deliveries exceeding 2.4 million units.
Chrysler's year-end sales report, to be released Friday, is expected to be one of the few bright spots for December, a month in which analysts predict industry volume will fall as much as 6 percent from strong year-ago levels.
Despite an expected drop in General Motors Corp.'s December sales by as much as 16 percent from year-ago levels, analysts say automakers sold enough cars and trucks during the month to enable the full year totals to match U.S. industry sales projections of 15.1 million light vehicles.
Chrysler Vice Chairman Robert Lutz told reporters at the Los Angeles International Auto Show that he expected the automaker's total December vehicle sales to be ""several percentage points"" ahead of last year's sales of 177,803 cars and trucks, which was a record for the month of December.
For the full 1996 year, Chrysler's sales of more than 2.4 million units exceeded their 1988 record of 2,208,057 cars and trucks.
Light truck sales, which have been accounting for about 70 percent of Chrysler's total, are projected to rise 8 percent, offsetting an expected 9 percent slide in passenger car sales, said Burnham Securities analyst David Healy.
Healy said GM's sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans -- the light truck category -- will be down significantly, in large part because the automaker was up against a tough comparison from a year ago.
Car sales also will plunge by as much as 20 percent, estimates Michael Luckey, of Luckey Consulting Group. He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labour strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.
""They're still being hurt by the strikes,"" he said. ""I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.""
GM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3.
Ford Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.
Robert Rewey, Ford group vice president of sales and marketing, said at the Los Angeles International Auto Show that he expected December car sales to be flat with the year-ago level, but truck sales were ""fantastic"" and should be up sharply.
Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.
""If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,"" said Luckey.
Ford's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, Luckey said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.
Imports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.
""The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,"" he said.
For December, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.
However, Luckey said the Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalise the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.
Most analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.
""It should be 15.1 million,"" said Luckey. ""That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.""
That total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.",0

"Chrysler Corp. minivans have came under fire again from safety regulators, who said Tuesday they stepped up probes into two problems, including reports that a 90-pound rear hatch door can close suddenly without warning.
Nearly 2 million minivans are involved in the investigations, which were also sparked by reports that side sliding doors on 1996 models flew open at high speeds.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it received reports that 39 people have been injured when the rear hatch door on 1991-1993 model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans dropped unexpectedly.
The problem occurs when bolts holding cylinders that prop the door open shear, according to the federal safety agency. The agency has received a total of 477 complaints. The probe, first launched in May and upgraded on Oct. 31, covers almost 1.3 million minivans.
NHTSA also upgraded a preliminary investigation into about 582,000 1996-model Caravan, Voyager and Town & Country minivans. It has received 19 complaints that the right or left sliding door can come open while the vehicle is moving.
Owners have reported doors opening a few inches or flying wide open at speeds from 15 to 60 mph. No injuries have been reported. NHTSA said it is not aware of any incidents involving vehicles built during or after January 1996.
Chrysler was the first automaker to offer a sliding door on the left side of a minivan. The feature has made the No. 3 automaker's minivans the hottest seller in a popular segment.
Chrysler agreed in 1995, under pressure from regulators, to replace the latches on the rear hatch doors on more than 4 million minivans but stopped short of recalling the vehicles, from the 1984 through 1995 model years. Safety officials said the doors could pop open during low-speed crashes.
Chrysler told the safety agency the sliding door problem may stem from incorrect latch adjustments by dealers, which the company attributed to problems with the service manual.
Chrysler also said eight of the complaints about side doors opening involved vehicles that had had door repairs made. Chrysler said it has corrected the manual procedure and has made three design changes to door components.
But NHTSA said it has continued to receive complaints about the doors opening on vehicles with no repair history.
Chrysler spokeswoman Michele Tinson said the automaker was working with the safety agency to resolve the complaints. Injuries reported from sudden closings of rear hatch doors have been minor, she said, noting Chrysler stood behind the safety record of its vehicles.
""Minivans are the safest vehicles on the road today,"" she said.
Separately, NHTSA said it upgraded an investigation into 621,000 1995 and 1996 Windstar minivans from Ford Motor Co. Regulators have received 327 complaints about brake problems, which have led to 76 accidents and two injuries.
In addition to the incidents reported to NHTSA, Ford said it has received 64,000 warranty claims that could relate to a brake problem causing long stopping distances.
Also, NHTSA said it opened an investigation into Land Rover's Discovery sport/utility vehicle. It has received two complaints that the right front door opened on 1996 models. Rover is a unit of German carmaker BMW.

"Haworth Inc. said Monday it received a $211.5 million payment for a patent infringement award against Steelcase Inc., ending a 17-year battle between the two Michigan office furniture giants over electrified office panels.
Of the total $211.5 million, Steelcase, the largest office furniture maker in the world, paid Haworth $96.8 million in damages and interest worth $114.7 million.
""While we don't agree with this ruling, we respect that the courts have the final word and it's time to move on,"" Steelcase President James Hackett said in a statement.
The two companies began warring over the issue in 1979. Haworth sued Steelcase in November 1985, alleging Steelcase infringed on its patents for pre-wired modular panel systems, which are used to build office cubicles.
Developed during the early 1970s, the technology provides a safe way for electricity to be routed through office panels, eliminating the need for extension cords and helping satisfy the growing demand for electronic office equipment, Haworth said.
The decision and damage award, which are binding and cannot be appealed, were entered Dec. 23 by a special judge appointed to determine damages in U.S. District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich.
In related rulings, the court denied Steelcase's allegations in a 1989 suit that Haworth infringed on two patents for prewired panels. It also upheld Haworth's position on a lawsuit it filed relating to computer keyboard shelves.
Steelcase won the first round of the original 1985 lawsuit when a federal court found Steelcase did not infringe Haworth's patent. Haworth appealed that decision and the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the lower court ruling in 1989.
The case then went to a second trial that was an alternative dispute resolution before the special judge in Washington. That trial determined damages and resolved Steelcase's 1989 patent lawsuit against Haworth.
In a news release, Haworth said the award provides vindication for its role in developing the first safe method of routing electricity through movable office panels.
""But no monetary award can make things right,"" said President Jerry Johanneson. ""No montary award can erase the gains our competitors made when they infringed our patents and used the technology that was rightfully ours.""
In addition to Steelcase, eight other companies have paid more than $75 million to settle patent infringement cases brought by Haworth, it said.
Based in Grand Rapids, Mich., with a total of 19,000 workers worldwide, Steelcase had total revenues of $2.6 billion for its 1996 fiscal year, which ended in February.
Haworth, based in Holland, Mich., with more than 9,000 employees around the world, had 1995 sales of about $1.2 billion.",0
"Ford Motor Co. said Tuesday it will move 2,500 sales, marketing and customer service workers out of the Renaissance Centre over the next two years, ending a downtown Detroit office presence that dates back to 1978.
The move was prompted by General Motors Corp.'s May purchase of the landmark complex located on the Detroit River for use as its new headquarters.
Included in the deal announced Tuesday were 26 acres of land next to the centre now used for employee parking that Ford agreed to sell to GM.
No financial terms were released. Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president of marketing and sales, said at a press conference both sides were ""happy"" with the deal, which has been completed.
Rewey said Ford, which occupies about 650,000 square feet in two of the center's four towers, had planned to stay in its location through 2005 when its leases expire.
""Our plans got changed -- by the new landlord,"" he said.
Most of the employees, who work in the Ford, Lincoln-Mercury and Customer Service Divisions, will be relocated to Ford's existing Regent Court building near the automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
Rewey said Ford was not pressured by GM to leave early, but decided to do so because it now has space to relocate workers as a result of its ongoing Ford 2000 reorganization.
Rewey declined to say if GM will pay any of Ford's relocation costs. Those expenses could be substantial because Ford's customer assistance and business assistance centres are computer-intensive, technically sophisticated operations.
Employees will begin moving by mid-1997 and should be out of the Renaissance Centre by the end of 1998.
Fearing his urban revitalisation efforts could be hurt, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer had encouraged Ford to stay in downtown Detroit. But Rewey said Ford could not find a suitable downtown location that would allow it to replicate the efficiencies it now enjoys at the Renaissance Centre.
He noted Ford is encouraging its outside advertising agencies and accounting suppliers to remain in Detroit.
Ford officials took pains Tuesday to point out the company remains committed to the resurgence of Detroit. Included in that is a $25 million renovation of the former Veterans Memorial Building late next summer that will serve as the new UAW-Ford Training Centre.
In October, Ford agreed to pay $40 million for naming rights to a new downtown stadium for the Detroit Lions professional football team.
But some local real estate observers said Ford's decision to leave Detroit does not bode well for the city, which is losing a long-time and prominent tenant. Even though GM will fill the space Ford is vacating, there is still a surplus of class A office space, said Joel Feldman, a broker and market analyst at Friedman Real Estate Group Inc. in Farmington Hills, Mich.
""It lessens the possibility that current vacant class A space will be able to fill up, and the spill-over effect on class B office space is diminished because of this,"" he said.
Ford's history with the Renaissance Centre dates back to 1972 when then Chairman Henry Ford II announced the Renaissance Centre development project, which was designed to attract business and employment that would lead to the revitalisation of downtown Detroit.
Ford said its 35,000-square-foot World of Ford exhibition and display area at Renaissance Centre will be discontinued in June 1997. Company officials said they are not sure where or how the exhibit, which is popular with marketing and sales workers, will be reconstructed.",0
"Nearly one quarter of ITT Automotive Inc's workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly and benefit rate of less than $10 an hour by 2000, the company's top executive said Tuesday.
ITT Automotive, a unit of ITT Industries Inc  paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers less than $10 an hour in 1995, and 10 percent that amount in 1990, said Timothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive.
The numbers, provided by Leuliette at the Automotive Industries' Executive Management Conference, were offered as another illustration of how auto suppliers need to continue slashing costs if they expect to remain an independent player in the fast-changing industry.
""Do we do that because we're mean?"" Leuliette said of the falling rates. ""No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3-4 percent price reduction.""
Leuliette spoke as part of a panel discussion with J.T. Battenberg, president General Motors Corp's Delphi Automotive Systems, and Robert Oswald, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Robert Bosch Corp's U.S. automotive unit.
Asked how much a supplier should expect to pay workers, Leuliette said the global hourly rate for labor-intensive assemblies such as wiring harnesses is $1 to $2. More technical products are made for $10 to $12 an hour.
""If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,"" he said.
Battenberg had three areas of advice for suppliers: focus on a few product areas; continuously stress quality; and pursue international alliances with other suppliers to expand more efficiently.
""I just don't think you can be all thing to all people. It's a lesson we learned at General Motors the hard way,"" Battenberg said.
Oswald said suppliers need to be more than good product innovators. ""At Bosch, we believe that our performance as a supplier is not based just on innovation, but also that weare meticulous in bringing that innovation to production,"" he said.
Meantime, Leuliette said in 2000 suppliers to ITT can expect to receive 80 percent of what they are paid now for their products.
He noted the supplier industry is under such pressure to reduce costs that firms need between eight percent and nine percent productivity growth in order to keep their present level of employees.",0
"The engines have been started in the race to succeed Alex Trotman for the top office at Ford Motor Co.
The company Thursday promoted two long-time Ford executives into positions that will allow them to prove if they are worthy of occupying one or more top spots at Detroit's No. 2 automaker.
Edward Hagenlocker, 56, was promoted to vice chairman from executive vice president, and put in charge of a new auto components organisation with 75,000 employees and revenues of $14 billion.
Jacques Nasser, 48, previously the group vice president in charge of product development, was named to Hagenlocker's old job of heading up Ford Automotive Operations, the company's core car and truck business.
Speculation has swirled for months about how Ford's board of directors plans to handle the succession of Trotman, who currenly holds the titles of chairman, chief executive officer and president. Trotman reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65 in July of 1998, but the board can ask him to stay on.
Complicating matters is the prospect of a Ford family member returning to a top officer's role for the first time since 1980.
Recent reports have said William Clay Ford Jr., 39, a great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, could be named a non-executive chairman, or chairman, when Trotman leaves.
Because Hagenlocker's nearly three-year tenure at Ford Automotive Operations has been marred by slumping profits and a slow start for the redesigned Taurus, some outsiders have said his chances for higher office have dimmed.
But Hagenlocker, a reserved man who joined the company in 1964 as a research scientist, has also overseen the launch of the hugely successful new F-Serieswell as the new Ford Expedition full-size sport utility, which is expected to be both popular and profitable.
Eugene Jennings, a retired professor of management at Michigan State University, said Hagenlocker's being put in charge of the new parts organisation could turn into a high-profile spot that should not btion.
""It's the one thing that Hagenlocker needs under his belt to give him the experience he needs to run the company,"" said Jennings, a long-time Big Three observer.
Nasser has been at Ford nearly as long as Hagenlocker. Born in Lebanon but raised in Australia, Nasser first joined the company in 1968 as a financial analyst. He rose through several international assignments, earning a reputation as a ""no-nonsense petrol head.""
While Hagenlocker is stiff in front of the media, Nasser moves easily among reporters, entertaining them with colourful stories about cricket and his globe-trotting life abroad.
Wesley Brown, of industry consultant CSM Forecasting in Farmingtills, Mich., said Nasser's new role also offers him a chance to further demonstrate his abilities at running the company.
""It clearly puts Nasser in a position to take over from Trotman when he retires,"" said Brown.
For his part, Trotman was circumspect about the succession question. At a news briefing Thursday, he was asked if the board is actively working on the issue.",0
"CMS Energy Co should have no trouble meeting or exceeding the $2.40 to $2.45 a share earnings estimates that analysts forecast for all of 1996, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William McCormick said Friday.
""We feel very comfortable we'll be at or above that range,"" he said in a telephone interview from the utility's Dearborn, Mich. headquarters. CMS, the parent company for Consumers Power Co, Michigan's largest utility, earned $2.27 a share on total revenues of $3.9 billion in 1995.  
Earlier Friday, CMS announced the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) approved a settlement that removes the final rate uncertainty of its Midland Cogeneration Venture L.P., ending a 10-year regulatory saga involving the embattled plant.
The settlement allows Consumers Power to include the cost of buying the final 325 megawatts of power from the plant in its customer rates. Previously, CMS was granted permission to include in rates the cost of buying 915 megawatts of the plant's total 1240 megawatts of power.  
""The last significant uncertainty related to the whole Midland situation was the recovery of the remaining 325 megawatts,"" said McCormick, who added he has been dealing with the Midland project since he became CEO of CMS 11 years ago.
McCormick said the settlement removes the possibility of future earnings write-downs related to the project. CMS recorded an after-tax charge of $343 million in the fourth quarter of 1992 from an earlier settlement of Midland Cogeneration issues.  
CMS' stock was up $1 to $32-3/8. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 206,700, indicating trading for Friday would be more than 300,000 shares, heavier than normal, said McCormick.
CMS' construction of the facility as a nuclear power plant was abandoned in the mid-1980s. CMS finished its conversion to a gas-powered energy plant in 1990.
Midland Cogeneration, the largest cogeneration project in North and South America, is a partnership of CMS; Dow Chemical Co, Coastal Corp, Asea Brown Boveri Inc and Fluor Corp.
Approval of the settlement prompted Standard & Poor's to revise its outlook on Consumers Power and CMS to positive from stable, and re-affirm its ratings on the companies.
McCormick said he believes CMS will be meeting with the debt rating agency to discuss a possible upgrade of its ratings.",0
"Chrysler Corp. Monday said sales rose a scant 1.4 percent in November, a dramatic slowdown for the nation's third-largest automaker and a sign of what analysts said would be a weak month for Detroit's Big Three.
November sales of 179,628, up from 177,073 in November 1995, set a record for the month, and Chrysler's year-to-date sales of 2,271,022 surpassed its previous full-year record of 2,208,057 set in 1988. But the 1.4 percent increase was one of the smallest for Chrysler so far this year.
Chrysler said car sales fell 11 percent based on daily selling rates last month while sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans rose 7 percent.
Chrysler credited a strong performance from its Dodge and Jeep divisions. Dodge sales were 95,022 and Jeep sales reached 42,835, both records for November.
""Our new 1997 lineup continues to generate healthy traffic at our dealerships,"" James Holden, executive vice president of sales and marketing, said in a statement.
But Burnham Securities Inc. analyst David Healy said sales to fleet dealers such as car rental agencies fell in November, contributing to the weak performance.
Both General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are expected to post lower car sales for November, leading to weak overall sales for the No. 1 and No. 2 automakers.
That is expected to drag down the industry's sales by 2 percent to 3 percent, according to Michael Luckey, president of Luckey Consulting Group.
""The car market from what I'm hearing is going to be lousy for just about everybody,"" he said.
Luckey said annual sales based on November's expected performance and government seasonal data would be 14.7 million to 14.8 million units. The rate for October was 14.9 million, and the rate for November 1995 was 14.8 million.
But the actual november sales rate could be 300,000 units below that, he said, because of fluctuations in government data used to compute the rate.
Analysts noted that slower sales were expected for the second half of 1996, but Healy said it was too early to declare a recession for car sales because monthly sales rates can be volatile.
GM, set to report sales on Tuesday, is seen posting a 15 percent drop in overall sales, with car sales down more than 20 percent and light truck sales unchanged.
Car sales were hurt by the three-week Canadian autoworkers' strike in October, which caused a production loss of some 100,000 GM cars. Contributing to the weak numbers were customers who chose to wait for GM's 15 new models instead of buying older versions.
""Certainly for quite awhile their car sales are going to be hurt by these painfully slow transitions to the new models,"" said Luckey, noting it could be next spring before GM has full availability of its new cars.
Healy estimated Ford sales will slide 4 percent to 5 percent. Sales of pickups, minivans and sport/utilities are expected to rise 2 percent, with car sales off 12 percent, he said. Ford is scheduled to announce its sales on Wednesday.
Subaru of America Inc. reported a 21 percent jump in sales to 11,072 from the previous month. Year-to-date sales from Subaru, a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd of Japan, were 108,533, also up 21 percent from a year ago.
Volvo AB said U.S. sales fell 3.6 percent to 6,582 for November.",0
"Labor lawyer James Hoffa, refusing to concede defeat in the Teamsters union presidential election nearly a week after his opponent claimed victory, called Thursday for a congressional investigation into the vote.
Hoffa on Tuesday formally asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to impound the ballots and initiate an FBI investigation into ""serious irregularities"" in the election.
""We really have what I call Teamstergate,"" Hoffa told reporters at a news conference Thursday at the Teamsters' Detroit offices, where his legendary father, the late Jimmy Hoffa, ruled the union in the 1950s and '60s.
Incumbent Teamsters President Ron Carey on Saturday claimed victory in the hard-fought election, winning by an apparent margin of about 17,000 votes. But 41,002 ballots were set aside for further eligibility checks, and Hoffa says more than 25,000 other ballots may have disappeared.
After all eligible votes were tallied late Saturday, court-appointed Election Officer Barbara Zack Quindel accounted for 485,605 mail-in ballots returned. But last week she reported that the total number of ballots received was 511,268, an estimate based on receipts from the U.S. Postal Service.
Hoffa said he wants an explanation for the discrepancy between the ballots counted and the ballots received.
""If I lost, I lost. I just want a fair election,"" Hoffa said.
Carey, 60, was first elected president of the 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters as a reformer in 1991. His apparent re-election was lauded by AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, who had remained neutral during the campaign.
Meanwhile, Quindel decided Wednesday to void 120 Hoffa votes after finding that a Hoffa backer and former officer of Teamsters Local 743 in Chicago violated election rules by collecting and mailing ballots for other members, according to her spokesman, Jeff O'Mara.
Acting on a protest filed by Carey's campaign last week, O'Mara said Quindel decided it would be too extreme a remedy to void all of the local's ballots.
The ballots from Local 743 were among the 41,002 ballots that were being checked for eligibility.
The election officer has not disclosed interim results of the tabulation of those ballots and O'Mara said he did not know when the final tally would be completed.
But Hoffa said Thursday that initial tabulations of the so-called challenged ballots have cut Carey's lead by as much as 2,400 votes.
The Carey campaign, however, said the lead was cut only by about 1,500 votes. The latest count which included the strongly pro-Hoffa Local 743, showed Carey with 230,111 and Hoffa with 214,906 with about 30,000 of the challenged ballots remaining to be processed and counted if found to be eligible, the Carey campaign said.",0
"While General Motors Corp. struggles to overcome labor costs of $43 an hour at its parts plants, the head of one global auto supplier is painting a Darwinian view of the future, in which an increasing number of workers earn less than $10 an hour.
Nearly one-quarter of ITT Automotive Inc.'s workers around the world will be paid a combined hourly wage and benefit rate of less than $10 by 2000, the company's top executive said this week at a conference of suppliers.
That sobering forecast spotlights a long-term problem for GM, which is now in the throes of negotiating a new three-year labor contract with the United Auto Workers union.
""They can't make a buck stamping out taillights and paying people $43 an hour,"" said David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
Adds Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi: ""Their 43 other competitors aren't going to say 'We'll spot you a couple of years.'""
Timothy Leuliette, president and chief executive officer of ITT Automotive, said the company paid 15 percent of its 35,000 workers around the world less than $10 an hour in 1995. That was up from 10 percent of its employees at that pay level in 1990.
""Do we do that because we're mean?"" Leuliette said of the falling wage rates. ""No. We did that because we have to promise our customers a 3 to 4 percent price reduction.""
Facing union demands for greater job security, GM must find a way for its massive Delphi Automotive Systems parts business to stay competitive in the worldwide auto supplier market.
In the current talks, Delphi has said 12 of its U.S. component facilities are underperforming and should not be subject to the job guarantees the UAW has received from other automakers.
Even if it accepts the economic terms already agreed to by Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. , GM and Delphi will pay the average U.S. parts worker a base wage of nearly $19 an hour in the first year of the contract, and more than $21 in 1999, the third year of the agreement.
About 42 percent of Delphi's workers are located in the United States, where the combined hourly wage and benefit cost of a UAW worker under the 1993 national agreement is about $43.
Delphi, with 1995 revenues of $26.4 billion, is in 167 businesses around the world. Global expansion remains a focus for the company, which this year expects 35 percent of its revenues to come from customers outside of GM's North American Operations, Delphi President J.T. Battenberg said Tuesday.
But as Leuliette's comments indicate, the global auto supplier industry is growing increasingly competitive.
The worldwide hourly wage rate for assembling a labor-intensive part such as a wire harness is between $1 and $2, he estimated. More technical parts cost $10-$12 an hour. Leuliette said workers in Vietnam will earn $64 a month working 48 hours a week putting together wiring harnesses for ITT.
""If you are regionally competitive but not globally competitive, you will unlikely be a supplier to ITT,"" Leuliette told the gathering of suppliers in Detroit.
ITT Automotive, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., is the biggest unit within ITT Industries Inc., and one of the largest independent auto suppliers in the world.
The company, which has annual sales of about $5.5 billion, makes brake and chassis systems, as well as body and electrical components such as motors, actuators and wiper systems. Leuliette estimated the company's average global total wage costs at about $14 an hour.",0
"The U.S. auto industry celebrated its 100th birthday in 1996 with higher sales and a new labour accord, but it can expect tough competition from foreign shores in the coming year.
Clouds loom on the horizon, namely from Detroit's old nemesis -- Japan.
The relatively weak Japanese yen promises to give cost-conscious Big Three executives headaches. A weaker yen makes it cheaper for Japanese firms to produce vehicles in Japan and sell them in the United States.
Since April 1995, when the yen hit a high of 80 to the dollar, the Japanese currency has weakened. The rate is now about 114, meaning it takes more yen to buy one dollar.
Van Bussman, Chrysler Corp.'s top economist, believes the yen will continue in the 110-115 range for the first three to six months of 1997, then strengthen to about 100.
""I think it will be a substantial issue in 1997,"" Bussman said. ""The yen having weakened from 80 to 110 has given them tremendous profit potential in North America.""
A look back through 1996 shows that Japanese automakers have already turned the weaker yen to their advantage through lower prices.
Industry trade publication Automotive News reported the average 1997 model year price increase at Detroit's Big Three was $386, while the average price hike for Japanese automakers was a mere $8.
""It's going to be tough next year because we have the weaker yen,"" Ford Motor Co. Chairman Alex Trotman said recently.
Forecasts for 1997 project total vehicle sales will be roughly the same as the 15.4 million expected for 1996. But that's not all that bad, industry executives say.
It means the four-year upswing of car, sport utilty and pickup truck sales could continue for yet another year.
""We see moderate inflation. We see a steady continuation of economic expansion in the United States,"" Trotman said. ""We're looking for the car and truck industry to fall somewhere in the 15 to 15.5 million range for 1997, which we would describe as a pretty good year.""
Japanese automakers, which have introduced hot new car and sport utility vehicles this year, are set to unleash more new products in 1997.
Honda Motor Co. Ltd. will soon introduce its CR-V compact sport utility and is scheduled to bring out new versions of its Accord sedan and Odyssey minivan. Building on the momentum of its new Camry sedan, Toyota Motor Corp. will unveil a front-wheel drive minivan called the Sienna next fall.
Among the Big Three, 1996 proved to be the year that Chrysler's raft of stylised new products took off, outshining its two domestic rivals. The No. 3 automaker has boosted U.S. market share nearly two points to 16 percent, and its calendar year sales will post their best results since 1988.
General Motors Corp. will try to reverse a slide in both sales and market share next year as it continues with the introduction of 15 new cars and light trucks, including a new line of minivans.
GM will also look to improve its overall competitiveness with a new three-year contract with the United Auto Workers that could allow it to shed 30,000 workers. But that deal did not come cheaply. GM endured several strikes through the year that will cost it more than $1.6 billion.
At Ford, cost-cutting will remain a top priority next year. The No. 2 automaker has scored big in the market place with its new F-Series pickup trucks and Expedition full-size sport utility vehicle.
But its car sales have lagged, and Ford has been forced to slap incentives on its redesigned Taurus to push them out of dealer showrooms. Ford, which replaced the head of its core automotive operations in October, will also lose hundreds of millions from European and South American operations in 1996, but sees improvements in those areas for 1997.",0
"Sales of light vehicles in December are expected to be down as much as 6 percent from an unusually strong month a year ago, but analysts say the pace was robust enough for 1996's total to match industry projections of 15.1 million units.
General Motors Corp. will endure the largest drop of the Big Three, with the daily sales rate off by an estimated 16 percent from December 1995, according to David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc.
GM's sales of pickup trucks, sport/utility vehicles and minivans -- the light truck category -- will be down significantly, in large part because the automaker is up against a tough comparison from a year ago.
However, car sales will also plunge by as much as 20 percent, estimates Michael Luckey, of Luckey Consulting Group. He attributes the decline largely to the continued aftershocks of GM's labour strife this fall, which cost the automaker about 120,000 units of mostly car production.
""They're still being hurt by the strikes,"" he said. ""I think that's still a legitimate reason for one more month here in December.""
GM is scheduled to report its sales on Friday, Jan. 3. Also reporting Friday is Chrysler Corp., whose sales will be flat or up slightly from December a year ago.
Light truck sales, which have been accounting for about 70 percent of Chrysler's total, are projected to rise 8 percent, offsetting an expected 9 percent slide in passenger car sales, said Healy.
Ford Motor Co., scheduled to release its results Jan. 6, will enjoy one of its best year-to-year comparisons since March 1994, said Luckey, with sales rising between 8 percent and 9 percent against a somewhat weak performance in December 1995.
Ford's car sales are forecast to dip 3 percent to 4 percent. Last week, Ford added another $500 to the $500 rebate it was already offering on the 1997 Taurus, indicating its determination to hang on the title of the best-selling car in America. Taurus sales through November were about 10,000 units over the rival Honda Accord.
""If Taurus sales spurt up, cars might be a little bit better than that,"" said Luckey.
Ford's light truck sales are seen rising a sharp 20 percent, he said, thanks to the strength of its pickup trucks and popular Expedition full-size sport/utility.
Imports and transplants continued to take market share from the Big Three in December, Healy said, climbing to a combined share of 28.6 percent, up from 28.1 percent in November.
""The strong dollar and the weak yen are resulting in aggressive pricing by the Japanese makers, particuarly in intermediate and small passenger cars,"" he said.
For December 1996, the light vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate is expected to be in the mid-14 million range, analysts said, a precipitous drop from 15.9 million a year ago, the strongest month of 1995.
However, Luckey said the U.S. Commerce Department factors used to compute the rate penalise the total by 800,000 units, meaning the real rate is stronger than it would appear.
Most analysts expect the industry to finish the year at 15.1 million units.
""It should be 15.1 million,"" said Luckey. ""That's almost certain unless something very strange happens in December.""
That total would bring the average for the last three years to an unusually stable 15 million mark. In 1995, total light vehicle sales were 14.7 million, down from 15.1 million for all of 1994.",0
"Seven years after General Motors Corp created the Geo brand to entice more import buyers, the automaker is dropping the name, though it will continue to sell the Metro, Prizm and Tracker models as Chevrolet vehicles.
Chevrolet General Manager John Middlebrook said the Chevrolet image and its products have improved to the point where it no longer needed the Geo badge to attract new buyers.
Middlebrook said the move also fitted in with GM's efforts to unclutter its numerous brand images among consumers.  
GM created the Geo brand in 1989 as a sub-category of Chevrolet by renaming several Chevrolet vehicles. The name Geo, created under the direction of former GM Chairman Roger Smith, was meant to signify a world car.
GM plans no changes to the joint venture agreements that produce the Geo vehicles. The Prizm, essentially the same car as the Corolla from Toyota Motor Corp, is made by NUMMI, a Fremont, Calif.-based venture with Toyota.
Both the Metro and Tracker are produced in Ingersoll, Ontario, at CAMI, GM's joint venture with Suzuki Motor Corp.  
Middlebrook, who took over as general manager of Chevrolet in early 1996, said the move has been under consideration for some time, following the renewed strength of the Chevrolet brand.
Chevrolet, which currently has 16 different products, has introduced 18 new models since 1989. Consumer research has shown that awareness levels and purchase consideration jump between 30 percent and 40 percent when target buyers compare Chevrolet with Geo, the company said.
""It's the strength of the Chevrolet brand that's driving this,"" Middlebrook said.  
In a sign that GM still has an image problem with import buyers, Prizm sales lag those of its Corolla sister by a wide margin. The Prizm sold about 77,000 units through November of this year, compared with 188,000 for the Corolla.
Sales for all three Geo vehicles have fallen since reaching a high of 325,000 in the 1990 calendar year. Sales for the first 11 months of 1996 totaled 206,491. Although that was an increase of eight percent over a year ago, the vehicles carried rebates ranging from $300 to $1,000.  
In selling the Prizm as a Chevrolet, the division's 4,400 U.S. dealers will have a car similar in price and features to the Cavalier sedan.
However, Richard Scheidt, Geo brand manager, said GM did not anticipate too much duplication because traditional Geo buyers are different from typical Chevrolet buyers. For instance, he said the Prizm outsells the Cavalier in Texas.
Analysts reacted favorably to the move, saying it demonstrates another step by GM to use its marketing and advertising resources more efficiently.  
Joseph Phillippi, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it was also not out of the question that GM would eventually drop some of the current Geo models.
""I would guess at some point in time they would do some additional pruning,"" he said.
Chevrolet, which will gain some marketing efficiencies through the move, will pay for the new signs that dealers will be required to put up, Middlebrook said.
Gerald Seiner, a Chevrolet-Geo dealer in Salt Lake City, Utah, said dealers were in favor of the move because it would bring a simpler image to the Chevrolet brand.  
""Frankly, I haven't had anybody walk through the door and say they want to buy a Geo,"" he said.",0
"He once sailed his shipping empire through rough waters, steered an even course between China and Britain for years, but navigating Hong Kong into Chinese rule in 1997 will be the challenge of his lifetime.
Shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, chosen as Hong Kong's first Chinese leader on Wednesday after more than 150 years of British colonial rule, will take the helm on July 1.
""He will be charting the course for Hong Kong as it enters a new era. And he will be at the helm of what is at once an economic powerhouse and a dynamic, sophisticated metropolis,"" Governor Chris Patten, Britain's last colonial chief, said in a statement congratulating Tung on his victory.
It is a mission that has no precedent.
The territory that Tung governs will be the first British colony to have matured into a world trading economy and then handed back to a communist-ruled motherland.
China has promised the territory of 6.3 million people a great degree of autonomy and at least 50 more years of untrammeled capitalism but vowed to curb the pace of democratic reform.
The 59-year-old tycoon saw his fortunes almost dashed in the 1980s when the family firm met ill winds, but Beijing helped bail him out with a syndicated loan, and his firm regained its strength.
In his new role, Tung will have to tack between pro-democracy politicians who branded his triumph the death of democracy, the departing colonial British with their sense of lost empire, and a proud Beijing Communist leadership keen to set the stamp ""This is China"" on the map of Hong Kong forever.
The vocal pro-democracy lobby plans to challenge his authority with a no-confidence vote in the current legislature.
""What Hong Kong needs most is a champion for Hong Kong people as we face the unprecedented challenges of the handover -- not a spokesman for China,"" said Democratic Party leader Martin Lee.
Some analysts predicted Hong Kong's own version of China's ""red princelings"" -- sons and daughters of senior Communist Party officials -- would move to centre stage from now.
Members of families closely tied to the Beijing government since the 1950s are favourites for the 60 seats in the new legislature or roles in Tung's inner advisory cabinet.
The new elite will look to people such as legislator Leung Chun-ying, a policeman's son who has emerged as Beijing's trusted lieutenant in the transition process.
The princelings also include figures such as Timothy Fok, eldest son of Beijing's most trusted man in Hong Kong, tycoon Henry Fok, a kingmaker in the contest that Tung won.
Tung must now swiftly lay down a gameplan for the next six months with Beijing, political analysts said.
He must also work closely with the politicians and business titans likely to be brought into the post-1997 provisional legislature and advisory cabinet known as the Executive Council.
""He will start out with a unity of support behind him at least from the more moderate and pro-China in Hong Kong,"" said political analyst Michael DeGolyer of the Baptist University.
""I think he's going to have to move rather rapidly to talk to the people in Beijing. He is going to have to move rather rapidly to meet with Provisional Legco (Legislative Council) members,"" DeGolyer said.
Tung's first bite at his realm will come on Thursday when the China-controlled Hong Kong Preparatory Committee crafting 1997 power structures meets over the border in Shenzhen city.
Very soon, Tung will also have to talk to Hong Kong's popular top civil servant, Chief Secretary Anson Chan.
Tung has said he would like to keep Chan as chief secretary but her past defence of Patten's democratic reforms may have dented her credibility and spoiled her chances of staying on.
Tung is keen not to rock the boat and has said he aims to keep as much of the civil service intact as possible. ""Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,"" Tung said before the vote.",0
"The head of Hong Kong's main pro-democracy group said on Tuesday that the man likely to be the first post-colonial leader after British rule is a pro-China yes-man, and described preparations for the sovereignty change as a disaster.
Martin Lee, head of the Democratic Party, the largest in Hong Kong's legislature, told Reuters in an interview that shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa was indebted to Beijing for a company bail-out years ago and was unlikely to defend democracy.
""The Hong Kong people want and need a defender of the Hong Kong system. What we are getting, it seems, is somebody who is going to be a spokesman of China. That is very unfortunate.
""The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him to protect our rights, not because he is a bad man, he is a nice guy, but I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,"" he said.
Tung, 59, is the favourite to win when a 400-member selection committee meets on Wednesday to pick the chief executive of the special administrative region (SAR), as Hong Kong will be called after China takes over next July 1.
Britain is handing the colony back to Beijing under a treaty called the Joint Declaration, which promises to keep Hong Kong's freewheeling capitalist system intact for a further 50 years.
Lee said there was never any doubt Tung would win, echoing a widely held view that the future leader was picked in Beijing.
The lawyer and legislator said Tung owed China a big debt for a Chinese-sponsored financial bailout of his family firm, the Oriental Overseas group, in the 1980s.
""How can he say no to Beijing? Beijing will say 'wait a minute, who bailed you out in the early 1980s and who put you in this position?"" Lee said.
But his party would try to work with Tung if he won. ""We are quite prepared to cooperate with the chief executive irrespective of the personality involved...we cannot carry on as a political party without dialogue with the chief executive.""
Lee denied accusations by Tung that the Democratic Party was anti-China. ""That's clearly wrong. We have always supported the return of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the British to the Chinese government on July 1.
""We only criticise China whenever we believe the Joint Declaration has been broken by China...in these circumstances we have a duty to object and to oppose.
""It is far too simplistic and wrong for Mr Tung to say we are anti-China. We are not. China is our country. I have yet to see him side with Hong Kong on any key issue, like the provisional legislature,"" Lee said.
Britain and the Hong Kong democrats have criticised China's plan to scrap the elected Legislative Council and install a provisional legislature next July as an attempt to kill off democracy.
""It's going to be the most disastrous thing. Once you allow China to set up an effectively appointed legislature when under the Joint Declaration we were promised an elected legislature, you are actually accepting that China can break the Joint Declaration at will. So what other provision is safe?"" Lee said.
He said Beijing had made clear the new legislature would pass repressive laws to control the freedom of the press and the freedom of assembly. ""There can be little doubt that the rule of law as we know it will not be there any more. Freedoms can no longer be protected.""
Lee said 134 candidates nominated for the provisional legislature this week would all take orders from Beijing.
""You would not find even five of them who could be called democrats, by any stretch of the imagination.""",0
"More than 100 politicians, including half of today's lawmakers, have sought seats on a controversial Beijing-controlled legislature in a move that may cripple Hong Kong's parliament in the twilight of British rule.
Before a registration deadline on Monday, 112 people had applied to join the ""provisional legislature"", among them 33 members of the present elected Legislative Council (Legco).
Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight next June 30, and Beijing is pressing ahead -- despite British objections -- on setting up a provisional interim legislature to replace the elected Legco at the handover.
The provisional legislature will be selected on December 21.
The territory of 6.3 million people now faces a bizarre prospect of having two legislatures for the final six months of British rule -- one elected, legal and active, and a shadow ""selected"" chamber vulnerable to courtroom battles.
The number of seats on Legco and the new body is the same -- 60. An official of the China-controlled committee supervising the three-week registration process said 217 people had requested application forms, so there could be more contenders at the last minute.
Among 33 incumbent lawmakers who have applied are Legco speaker Andrew Wong, whose bid startled the political community last weekend and sparked fears that Legco could disintegrate.
""Cracks which have already emerged within the Legislative Council over the bid by some members for a seat on the provisional legislature will widen in the next six months,"" said political commentator Chris Yeung.
""When you have two bodies from which laws emanate at the same time, there's going to be some confusion and dispute,"" said analyst Michael DeGolyer of Hong Kong's Baptist University.
Those wanting a seat in the new chamber also include 11 ex-lawmakers and 22 former election contestants defeated in 1995 elections in which pro-democracy groups led by the Democratic Party fared strongly.
The 1995 losers applying for a seat include prominent pro-Beijing politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Peggy Lam and Elsie Tu.
Applicants also include 47 newcomers to legislative contests, many of whom are members of the hand-picked 150-member Preparatory Committee crafting the post-1997 Hong Kong power structures on behalf of China's communist rulers.
Other newcomers are members of the 400-strong Selection Committee. This is the China-backed panel that will chose the first post-colonial leader on Wednesday, with the winner forecast to be conservative-minded shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa. The committee will also be responsible for selecting the provisional legislative body on December 21.
An opinion poll published on Monday by the independent daily Ming Pao showed Hong Kong people split over the legitimacy of the provisional legislature.
The poll showed 32 percent supporting the body, 30 percent against, and 38 percent voicing no opinion. A sample of 983 respondents were surveyed by telephone for the poll.
The Democratic Party, the largest in the Legco with 19 seats, are absent from all China-controlled transition bodies.
They have boycotted the selection process, branding the provisional legislature as undemocratic and illegal, and have vowed to challenge its legitimacy in the courts.
The threat has forced Beijing's representatives in Hong Kong to consider locating the interim legislature in mainland China in the transitional period.
Britain has condemned China's plan as reprehensible and unnecessary and has ruled out all cooperation with the body.",0
"Britain and China clashed over the future of Hong Kong on Wednesday as the colonial power took steps to bring in a pre-emptive new law on subversion ahead of the capitalist territory's 1997 return to communist-ruled China.
The quarrel was ignited when the government on Tuesday laid down legal markers defining the concepts of treason, sedition, subversion and secession in a bid to head off Chinese-style jailings of dissidents after Beijing takes over the colony.
The draft bill would jail only people who plot the violent overthrow of government, not non-violent critics and dissidents.
Chinese officials in Hong Kong immediately attacked the move and pro-China politicians said the law would probably be erased and replaced after China resumes sovereignty at midnight next June 30, when a century and a half of colonial rule expires.
A senior negotiator on the Hong Kong handover, Chen Zuo'er, told reporters Britain should not have acted unilaterally, but declined to say if China would repeal the bill if it became law.
A spokesman for China's de facto embassy in the territory attacked the move more sharply. ""Britain violated its promise that all major issues must be decided through negotiations with China in the latter stage of transition,"" the spokesman said.
""Britain will have to take responsibility for all the consequences of amending this law,"" the spokesman said.
British officials said they were confident the bill could get through the Legislative Council (Legco) next Wednesday. But some pro-China politicians and analysts were sceptical.
""The move itself is bound to be futile. Even if the bill is passed by the present Legco, I don't think there is any chance that it can survive the handover,"" said Tsang Yok-sing, leader of the biggest pro-Beijing political party in the territory.
""This decision will not be useful because the Chinese side will eventually roll back all the reforms undertaken by the Hong Kong government before July 1997,"" said analyst Sunny Lo at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
""The Hong Kong government is trying to commit suicide by putting this legislation through Legco,"" Lo said.
He said China would want a broader definition of subversion that would include subversion in non-violent forms.
Beijing had previously said it opposed any major changes to Hong Kong's criminal law before the change of flag.
Governor Chris Patten, often vilified by Chinese officials, said the government had taken the step only after 17 months of efforts to clinch agreement with China had failed.
He challenged China to say exactly what it objected to in the proposed new bill.
""We've tried to establish in a very reasonable way what these crimes should actually mean,"" Patten told Hong Kong radio during a visit to Japan. ""On this particular issue we really have been negotiating...with a brick wall,"" he said.
""There's been no response, no give at all,"" he said, adding that the only alternative to the bill would have been to break the government's word to Legco and the community that it would take action on the issue and ensure Hong Kong's ""decent way of life"" would not be ""swept away"" next July.
Independent pro-democracy legislator Emily Lau said she hoped China would not repeal the law, adding that if it did, ""that will definitely cause instability in Hong Kong, and it will be a very high price for both China and Hong Kong to pay.""
Treason and sedition are already on Hong Kong's law books.
The last time somebody was prosecuted for sedition was in 1953, and for treason in 1946. But These offences have since largely fallen.
Subversion and secession however are new concepts in the law required by China in Hong Kong's post-1997 constitution, known as the Basic Law.",0
"The skyscrapers are decked with fairy lights. Red-cloaked Santas pat children on the head. Christmas carols ring out. It is Christmas in Britain's last major colony, but will it ever be like this again?
The most spectacular Christmas light displays in the world are strung from Hong Kong's skyscrapers, featuring giant illuminated Santas and reindeer covering entire facades, beaming a rainbow of colours along the famed Hong Kong harbour skyline.
Hong Kong -- shopping paradise of the world -- is awash with Christmas. Its glass and marble malls brim with exorbitant festive displays, its shops push the fanciest, most expensive brand names in the world, specially repackaged for the season.
But after Britain pulls out and Communist-ruled china takes over next July, what then?
Will Christmas turkey, Christmas pudding and Christmas cake be allowed to grace the yuletide dinner table? Even if it does, will it taste the same?
Will revellers pull Christmas crackers and drink themselves silly in merriment as many do today?
Will China allow bourgeois extravagance and Western customs? Will charities run their ""Operation Santa Claus"" fundraising drive for the disadvantaged and underprivileged? Will Christians be free to worship at Midnight Mass?
If China lives up to its promises, the answer to all these questions is a resounding ""yes"".
China has promised to allow Hong Kong to retain its freewheeling capitalist system for a further 50 years, as a quasi-autonomous part of the motherland under a ""one country two systems"" policy. This means freedom of religion will stay. And the hybrid cocktail of customs and traditions, too.
However, many of Hong Kong 6.3 million people worried that pro-democracy protests such as a Christmas Eve vigil and the mass dispatch of Christmas cards to mainland dissidents by human rights groups on Tuesday might not be allowed again.
It is also doubtful if Queen Elizabeth's Christmas broadcast will ever again be on Hong Kong public radio and television.""
Christmas is still going to be a holiday next year in Hong Kong, as is the other main Christian festival, Easter.
Only the Queen's official birthday and World War Two victory holidays are to be removed after China takes over.
And, in this overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese territory, there are more non-Chinese than ever, despite the gradual departure of expatriate colonial civil servants and company executives.
There are 37,000 Americans, 33,000 British and 30,000 Canadians, enough to keep a few Christmas parties going. The largest foreign group, 140,000 Filipinos, mostly brought in as servants, are also a strong Christian community.
Nevertheless, there are misgivings how much will remain the same in Hong Kong. And there's a whiff of melancholy and pre-nostalgia among expatriates this festive season.
It's almost like a ""last supper"", their minds tilted towards midnight next June 30, 1997, the moment when the British flag will be furled away here forever.
Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's annual ""Christmas Song Choice"", which will be aired on local radio, reflects the mood.
His selection starts with Louis Armstrong singing ""Basin Street Blues"", followed by ""As Time Goes By"" by Jimmy Durante.
Patten gathered his family and friends on Wednesday night, Christmas night, for a traditional dinner of roast turkey.
All assembled were aware it could be the last Christmas dinner in the regal Government House overlooking the harbour.
Patten's successor Tung Chee-hwa, who will be Hong Kong's first Chinese leader, has indicated he doesn't want to live in the mansion that symbolises Hong Kong's one and a half centuries of British colonial rule and 150-plus years of China's national shame. He says the residence is cramped and inauspicious.
So no more Christmas there, at least.
Hong Kong's final year as a British colony has seen the balance of power tilt into China's orbit, even before the change of flag arrives. Chinese influence waxed and Britain's waned.
However, just as Christmas has become a commercial success in Japan, the festival will inevitably live on -- Chinese-style.
Hong Kong Chinese vie with each other to lavish expensive presents on their children.
Even over the border in mainland China, Christmas shopping sprees are catching on. There, Santa Claus has taken to riding a rickshaw, instead of a sleigh.",0
"Hong Kong's Governor Chris Patten on Friday denounced a legislature that Beijing plans to impose on the territory as a ""rubber stamp"" and said Britain and China should fight it out in the World Court.
""The International Court of Justice will, I'm sure, be able to sort things out, and we'd be very happy to put our arguments to them,"" Patten told Reuters in an interview.
His remarks, on the eve of a gathering in China to create the legislature, coincided with a toughly worded statement in London by Foreign Minister Malcolm Rifkind, who urged China to reconsider its plan or face international pressure.
""Clearly this weekend is going to be a very disagreeable one,"" Patten said of Saturday's gathering of 400 of Hong Kong's elite who will meet over the border in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.
They will elect 60 new legislators to take over lawmaking next July 1.
On that day, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, after a century and a half under the British flag, with a treaty pledge from Beijing that it can stay a distinct entity with its laissez faire capitalist system intact for a further 50 years.
The transition has been bumpy since China decided to disband the elected Legislative Council and appoint a new interim body without a mass vote, rolling back the expansion of democracy ushered in by Patten over the past four years.
Democrats in Hong Kong have said they will mount legal challenges if the interim body meets in the territory before July 1.
Calling China's plan a ""sad and bad decision to go ahead with the establishment of a rubber stamp legislative body"", Patten said it was designed to reduce democrats involved in lawmaking and would have serious legal repercussions.
He said that if China insisted the body was in line with Sino-British handover accords, ""let them join Britain in making a joint submission to the World Court, the International Court of Justice, so that we can actually get a ruling from the ICJ.""
But Patten also said he would go ahead with efforts to help Hong Kong's future leader, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, to prepare his administration. Tung was picked this month by the same 400-strong Selection Committee choosing the legislature.
Patten said he would meet his successor on Monday to explore a framework for pre-handover cooperation.
""We will cooperate in helping him establish an office, in helping him prepare for July 1, 1997. We will do everything to cooperate within the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. But there is absolutely no requirement whatsoever for a provisional legislature before July 1,"" he said.
He said China might be able to ""trash an institution"" but it could not ""stamp out the spirit of democracy"" in Hong Kong.",0
"Canadian envoys on Tuesday dismissed reports that thousands of Hong Kong people in Canada may be forced to flock home en masse ahead of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China in order to protect their residence rights.
Canada's commissioner in Hong Kong, Garrett Lambert, and the country's ambasador to China, Howard Balloch, said they believed China would soon decide on the issue, which has been a stumbling block in Sino-British talks on the territory.
But Lambert said Hong Kong people who had emigrated from the British colony might have to live in Hong Kong as Canadians in future and lose their local voting rights after it becomes a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China on July 1, 1997.
Lambert told reporters he had been informed by China's envoy in Hong Kong, Zhou Nan, that progress was being made by Chinese and British negotiators on the problem of right of abode.
The question is one of the major unresolved issues facing the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which meets this Wednesday.
""This is a good file. It's one on which progress is being made. Mr Zhou said he expected that we would have a decision announced in the JLG soon -- my guess is probably in early January,"" Lambert said.
""It now seems fairly obvious that you do not have to be physically present in Hong Kong to protect your interests if you are already a permanent resident of Hong Kong before the transition,"" he said.
However, Lambert said questions remained about political and working rights of Hong Kong emigrants who return to live in the territory after 1997.
Of all Western nations, Canada has one of the largest immigration relationships with Hong Kong.
Apart from some 500,000 Hong Kong people who have emigrated to Canada in recent years, some 30,000 Canadian citizens live in Hong Kong, many of them originally Hong Kong citizens.
Press reports in Hong Kong have quoted British officials warning of a chaotic mass return of Hong Kong emigrants if China insists on them being in Hong Kong in person on the July 1 handover day in order to keep their residence rights.
Chinese officials have said in the past that this would be their bottom line, but the JLG has reached no agreement on it.
Canada has delayed a decision on granting visa-free entry to holders of a new Hong Kong passport to be issued after the handover, pending guarantees from China on the repatriation of Chinese who enter Canada illegally.
Replying to a reporter on Tuesday, Lambert denied Canada had any grounds to believe the SAR passport had been compromised from a security viewpoint.
Balloch declined to confirm or deny that significant numbers of Chinese illegal immigrants had entered Canada using Hong Kong documents that were illegally issued or obtained.
The envoys also denied local press reports that Canada had received a comprehensive list of Chinese dissidents living in exile in Hong Kong, and that it planned to grant them refuge after 1997. They said some individual dissidents had come forward but declined to comment further.",0
"Hong Kong's top policeman said on Monday he was confident the territory's police could handle any disturbances after the July 1 handover to China without the help of China's People's Liberation Army.
Police Commissioner Eddie Hui, unveiling crime figures for 1996, told reporters that offences had fallen by 14 percent in the year, reaching a 15-year low and making Hong Kong one of the world's safest cities.
Hui was confident of tackling any crime problem, including mass disturbances, despite an exodus of senior officers, mainly expatriates, from the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.
China resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1 this year after a century and a half of British colonial rule. Many in Hong Kong have raised fears of a breakdown in law and order, including when the handover takes place at midnight on June 30.
Officers taking early retirement packages privately voice anxiety that Hong Kong's police will become tarnished by China-style corruption after the handover.
Pro-democracy politicians have warned that China could impose repressive laws and use its PLA garrison troops, whose colleagues crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, to keep order and put down protests.
Asked by Reuters if the police might call in the PLA to help deal with disturbances after the handover, Hui said: ""I hope not. I can't foresee any situation which I cannot handle, which would require the assistance of the People's Liberation Army.""
He said the exodus of officers from the service had not dented the force's ability to deal with mass disturbances in this freewheeling city of 6.3 million people.
""The senior officers who are leaving have little to do with crowd control,"" he said, adding that the force had sent many officers abroad for training in recent years and was prepared to deal with any outbreak of unrest.
""The overall manpower situation is very sound,"" he said.
Police Deputy Commissioner for Operations, Peter Wong, dismissed suggestions that the police were being pushed by China to get tough with political demonstrators, after a year of confrontations involving pro-democracy groups hostile to China.
""We're under no pressure from anybody in dealing with demonstrations,"" Wong said, adding that the Hong Kong police respected the population's right to demonstrate peacefully.
The enforcement of Hong Kong laws would remain solely the prerogative of the Hong Kong Police, he said.
Hui said 155 expatriates had asked to retire in the run-up to the handover, representing just five percent of the total of 3,000 senior officers on the force.
Asked to give reasons for the police's success in whittling down crime, Hui said he had sent more police out on the beat.
""We have moved a lot of our officers to the front line, to the streets, to make our presence more visible,"" he said.
He said Beijing's crackdown on crime last year had contributed to a more peaceful Hong Kong, where crime often has mainland links.
He said cooperation with Chinese police would be stepped up after the handover when Hong Kong's Interpol office, now a sub-group of Britain, would become a sub-group of China.
The force is to drop the word ""royal"" from its name and abandon the British insignia on July 1.
But it will continue to work in both English and Chinese and will retain exclusive responsibility to maintain law and order and police the Hong Kong side of the border with China, he said.",0
"With China's takeover of Hong Kong rapidly looming, the British colony faces a swirl of politics and diplomatic jousting in the week ahead, the last before China names the territory's first post-colonial governor.
British and Chinese negotiators, often sparring over the details of the sovereignty transfer, will meet on Wednesday for three days in their latest bargaining round.
Chinese sources said China is likely to lash out during the Joint Liaison Group session at a British attempt to foist a soft subversion law on the territory before the mid-1997 handover.
Last Tuesday Britain announced a draft bill that would make crimes such as subversion and sedition a crime only if they entailed violence, making clear mere dissident-style criticism of the authorities was not a crime.
China has denounced the move. ""This will only cause disruption and instability in Hong Kong,"" China's spokesman in Hong Kong Zhang Junsheng said on Friday. Some members of the pro-China lobby predicted the law would be replaced by a more Chinese-style legislation after the handover on July 1.
The territory is also preparing for a visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord on Wednesday.
Lord, who is also heading for China amid signs of a thaw in Sino-U.S. ties, plans to meet Governor Chris Patten and his deputy Anson Chan, as well as China's hardline envoy in the territory, Zhou Nan, and shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, the favourite in the contest to be the first post-colonial leader.
Critics said Lord's meeting with Tung would be an undiplomatic signal from the United States tantamount to Washington picking the winner in the contest.
Fresh attacks on China are also expected on Wednesday from democrats in Hong Kong's elected legislature, which is set to be dissolved upon the handover and replaced with a new provisional body assembled under China's supervision.
Last week a Selection Committee of 400 rich or influential Hong Kong people, formed under China's careful control, quizzed Tung and two rivals over their policies and attitude to China.
Tung, 59, emerged as the most vocally pro-China contender, loosing off a volley of remarks that stressed loyalty and patriotism to China, attacked Patten's politics and threw in a snub on the inauspicious quality of the governor's residence.
The tycoon also suggested the Democratic Party, the territory's largest, should stop confronting China if it wanted to participate in post-handover political establishment, which drew an attack from Patten.
""You can't, nobody can, freeze out of the political debate in Hong Kong, out of the dialogue about Hong Kong's future, those who represent majority opinion in Hong Kong,"" Patten told Hong Kong's government-funded radio on Saturday during his visit to Japan.
The 400-member Committee will meet again on December 11 to vote for the new chief executive. Most people now consider Tung's rivals Ti Liang Yang, a former chief judge, and businessman Peter Woo, rank outsiders.
Many Hong Kong people were unimpressed by last week's performances, not least the territory's pro-democracy camp.
""Only empty promises and brief outlines were provided in their platforms,"" said legislator Fred Li of the Democratic Party.
He decried the fact Hong Kong's voters were not involved in choosing among the three contenders. ""All they need is the blessing of these 400 people,"" Li said.",0
"Chief Executive candidate Tung Chee-hwa, rated by a poll as the best man to deal with China after Britain leaves Hong Kong next year, said a proposed subversion law faces review by the post-colonial government.
""The Basic Law (Hong Kong's post-handover constitution) clearly states that it is up to the future government to draw up its own law on these matters,"" Tung told about 100 members of the 400-strong Selection Committee that will choose Hong Kong's future leader.
""The Special Administrative Region government will have to review these issues after the handover.""
Britain hands its colony back to Beijing at midnight next June 30. The China-controlled Selection Committee is in the midst of a three-day vetting of Tung and two rivals who are bidding to succeed colonial Governor Chris Patten.
The winner will be announced on December 11.
On Tuesday, Britain began the process of bringing in a law on subversion, laying down legal markers defining the concepts of treason, sedition, subversion and secession in a bid to head off Chinese-style jailings of dissidents after the handover.
China has condemned the move but stopped short of saying whether the law would be scrapped when it takes over the territory.
Tung, a billionaire shipping tycoon, also told the committee that Hong Kong should stand by China if Beijing is under sanction by foreign powers.
""If sanction is for political reasons then we have to consider Hong Kong's position. Maybe Hong Kong has to make some sacrifices,"" he said.
An opinion poll released on Thursday showed Tung to be the favourite among the 967 respondents and indicated 73 percent of them also believed Tung was the candidate best able to communicate with the Chinese government.
The poll, conducted by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, showed that only 7.2 percent thought former chief justice Ti Liang Yang could commmunicate well with Beijing while businessman Peter Woo scored only two percent.
But Yang was seen as being the most impartial of the three and the one most ready to voice his opinion to China.
Asked who was most likely to speak out against Beijing, 31 percent said Yang, 20 percent Tung and 4.8 percent Woo.
After the first day of questioning by the committee on Wednesday, Tung emerged as a better communicator than he had during previous occasions, analysts said.
They said he produced a clearly focused vision for Hong Kong, with the main thrust on putting business and economic interests first.
During the quizzing by committee members representing Hong Kong's business community, Tung blasted the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, urging it to drop its anti-China stance and to play a positive role in the transition for the sake of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
""At present they are objecting to anything Chinese,"" Tung said. ""This is not good in the long term or for the interests of Hong Kong.""
The Democrats are boycotting the Selection Committee, condemning its mission to pick the post-colonial leader as undemocratic and its task of assembling a new provisional body to supplant the elected legislature as a violation of handover pledges made by China.",0
"A former top judge who is vying to lead Hong Kong after China takes over next year has said the territory needs a neutral and impartial leader rather than a well-connected tycoon, and one who is tolerant towards dissent.
""I'm for tolerance,"" Yang Ti Liang, one of three candidates trying to become Hong Kong's first chief executive after Britain hands the colony back to China at midnight next June 30, told Reuters in an interview.
The 67-year-old Shanghai-born former chief justice, who shed his British knighthood a month ago, came through this month's first round of voting by a 400-strong China-backed Selection Committee with 82 of the votes.
He was well behind frontrunner Tung Chee-hwa, a shipping tycoon with strong China links who scored 206 votes, but ahead of another entrepreneur, Peter Woo, who scraped through with 54.
Tung has often been depicted as Beijing's favourite in the race. But Yang, who has emerged as the people's favourite in some recent opinion polls, and once with a lead of as many as 10 percentage points, is battling on, even though there will be no public vote for the top post.
""Of course the votes indicated that certainly the Selection Committee favours Tung much more than they favour me. It's an uphill battle. It's not easy. But I think there's still hope,"" Yang said.
Over the coming week candidates will be quizzed by committee members on their policies ahead of their final vote on December 11.
Asked if the committee was likely to heed his popularity with the public, Yang said: ""I think to a certain extent it will. I don't think they will follow the poll to the letter. If there's a vast difference shown between candidates in the polls, the committee will have to take note.""
Yang's campaign headquarters is a modest, cramped office rented in a hotel, in marked contrast the plush executive suites occupied by Tung. The ""campaign"" is a crusade to lobby business and interest groups, not the general public.
Yang described his greatest strength in comparison with Tung as his long experience as a fair, unbiased arbiter.
""I have no business connections or political connections ... having been a judge for the past 30 years. I am somebody above politics, above connections, neutral, impartial, as opposed to somebody who is very much in business and whose contact with the Chinese government is very good,"" he said.
""I think anybody who has a huge network with other people does give rise to the problem as to whether, if eventually selected, he might not be perceived to be influenced by these connections when making a decision.""
Yang said Hong Kong's future leader would not face a test of courage in standing up to Beijing's communist rulers to resist pressure for a crackdown on anti-communist dissenters and pro-democracy activists.
""It's not a question of being brave or not brave. It's a question of looking at the letter of the law and seeing what it allows,"" he said. ""I want to be on the side of tolerance.""
He said he hoped a law on sedition, treason and subversion required by Beijing would not be enacted by the controversial interim legislature that China plans to install at the handover, but by a new long-term legislature to be elected in 1998.
Yang also said he believed the Chinese Communist Party, which has long operated underground and behind the scenes in Hong Kong, should register as a party under local law if it planned to be active in the territory after 1997.",0
"Hong Kong's chief executive designate Tung Chee-hwa, fresh from an overwhelming leadership victory, launched a charm offensive on Thursday aimed at winning public confidence in a smooth transition to China.
At a meeting in this Chinese frontier city, the 59-year-old Shanghai-born former shipping magnate was also endorsed as Hong Kong's future leader by the 150-member China-controlled Preparatory Committee, which is crafting the territory's future political institutions.
A beaming, animated Tung appeared at a Shenzhen news conference, vowing to make himself regularly available to the press, and promising to aim for friendly cooperative relations with Hong Kong's Democratic Party and the outgoing colonial administration.
""Have you eaten?"" was his first remark as he entered a gathering of 100 Hong Kong journalists. He fielded his questions skillfully, shifting effortlessly between three languages -- Mandarin, Cantonese and English.
Tung quipped and charmed with great self-confidence and a charismatic style that would be the envy of many Chinese leaders in Beijing, not known for their skillful handling of the media.
He declared he would go on the offensive to persuade Hong Kong's 6.3 million people to trust a controversial 60-member provisional legislature which China plans to install in place of the present elected Legislative Council (Legco) when Britain hands back the colony to Beijing next July 1.
""I think you'll find the provisional legislature will have good credibility,"" the businessman turned politician said.
""The acceptability of the provisional legislature is gaining ground every day. I'm confident we'll find 60 people with credibility among the people of Hong Kong.""
Thursday's Preparatory Committee meeting in the boomtown of Shenzhen was working on a package of procedures for selecting the legislature on December 21, the next milestone in Hong Kong's march to Chinese rule.
Hong Kong's Democratic Party has condemned the move as an attempt to snuff out the territory's embryonic democracy and vowed to challenge the legislature's legality in the courts, forcing China to consider locating the body on the mainland rather than in Hong Kong.
But Tung said he would also like to charm the Democrats by sitting down with them and ""peacefully"" discussing the transition problems.
Tung said he hoped to cooperate with departing governor Chris Patten and the British colonial administration. He recognised there were many difficulties but said: ""Let's do what is best for Hong Kong.""
He also said that Hong Kong would continue its gradual shift towards greater democracy but only at the slower pace laid down in the territory's post-1997 constitution, the Basic Law.
""We will of course move forward on the course of democracy in accordance with the Basic Law,"" he said. ""The process has already begun. It's quite clearly defined in the Basic Law.""
Tung said he had no news yet on who he planned to bring into his kitchen cabinet, the Executive Council, or whether Hong Kong's current chief civil servant Anson Chan would stay on.
""I hope she will stay, I hope she will be my deputy,"" he said, repeating his desire for a through-train civil service and smooth transition.
Tung also said he would go to Beijing for investiture as the Chief Executive-designate of Hong Kong but no date had been set.",0
"Thumbing its nose at Britain, China brought Hong Kong's elected legislature a step closer to oblivion on Saturday when it founded a new lawmaking body to take over next July when it takes back the colony.
The birth of the Provisional Legislative Council in the frontier city of Shenzhen brought Hong Kong to a crucial turning point in its journey towards Chinese rule at midnight next June 30 and opened the way for a possible clash in the world court.
The body, stuffed with pro-China politicians and tycoons, was attacked by Britain, Washington and local protesters. London challenged China to let the International Court of Justice in The Hague rule on its legality.
The legislative body is a big crease in Sino-British relations that could cause instability in the territory in the run-up to the handover, now less than 200 days away.
The speaker of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and 32 other incumbent lawmakers were among the 60 members chosen by a 400-member China-controlled Selection Committee.
Congratulating the 60, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen declared the contest had been ""just, fair, open and based on democratic principles"" and had the approval of a wide spectrum of Hong Kong society.
Dominic Chan, recently expelled from the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest, also grabbed a seat. The Democratic Party has boycotted the selection as anti-democratic.
The winners included pro-China politicians such as Tsang Yok-sing, Elsie Tu and Peggy Lam, who were routed in 1995 Legco elections when more than a million people went to the polls and voted resoundingly for pro-democracy forces.
Pro-democracy groups staged noisy protests in Hong Kong declaring the Shenzhen meeting a ""fake election"" and a ""black day for democracy"". They launched 50 helium-filled balloons into China with a protest banner attached.
""Today we will have two legislatures...This is a constitutional crisis,"" said the Democratic Party's Andrew Cheng, a current legislator.
Beijing's communist rulers are bent on imposing themselves firmly on Hong Kong and on ending 150 years of national shame over the forced cession of the territory to Britain in 19th century wars over the opium trade.
Governor Chris Patten, who has introduced elements of democracy in this territory of 6.3 million people over the past four years, denounced the Shenzhen vote as a ""bizarre farce"".
""The reality is that over a million people in Hong Kong voted for the present Legislative Council. And up over the border now, 400 people -- 400 -- are voting for a so-called provisional legislature,"" Patten said on Saturday.
Dorothy Liu Yiu-chu, a Hong Kong member of China's parliament -- the National People's Congress -- and the Selection Committee, dissented and stayed away from the vote.
""I am sick. This is the official reason from the point of view of the Selection Committee. But I know, and I don't mind letting the world know, the real reason is that I don't agree to the establishment of the provisional legislature,"" she said.
Earlier this month she took part in the committee's first task, selecting shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa as Patten's successor.
Tung dismissed Britain's suggestion of world court arbitration on Saturday, saying: ""We cannot have a legal vacuum in 1997. This is a great day for Hong Kong.""
China's official spokesman in Hong Kong, Zhang Junsheng, said Britain's challenge would not undermine the provisional legislature's authority.
""Establishing the provisional legislature is an internal affair of China. If Britain demands international arbitration it is absurd and ignorant,"" Zhang told the Mad Dog Daily.
The U.S. Consul-General in Hong Kong, Richard Boucher, called the legislature vote ""a backward step"".
""We think it's a bad idea and a mistake,"" Boucher said. ""I don't think we would describe it as an open and fair election which is an essential part of Hong Kong's future stability and future business environment.""
Democratic Party leader Martin Lee has vowed to seek a court injunction against the provisional body if it meets in Hong Kong before July 1.
""If this sham legislature is lawful, why not appoint it and have it meet in Hong Kong, where the Supreme Court can decide on its legality,"" Lee said on Friday.",0
"The Hong Kong government was in a flap on Thursday after a bombshell admission that Britain could not protect Hong Kong holders of British passports after China takes over the colony next July.
Governor Chris Patten called an urgent meeting of the Legislative Council for later on Thursday to make a statement on the controversy, which arose after a British envoy said London could provide no consular protection for the passport holders.
Patten's spokesman said the issue had sparked ""considerable public interest and a good deal of misunderstanding"" as well as demands by legislators to meet him.
Patten would answer their questions at the extraordinary sitting of Legco on Thursday evening.
The uproar is the latest jolt in Hong Kong's often bumpy transition back to Chinese rule 208 days from now, when 150 years of colonial rule will end and the territory will become an autonomous region of China.
Britain's Senior Trade Commissioner, Francis Cornish, said on Tuesday that London could not protect the more than 135,000 Hong Kong people granted full British passports with right of abode in Britain under a special selection scheme in 1990.
In a concession to widespread demands for full British citizenship after Beijing's 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, London offered passports to 50,000 Hong Kong households, a privileged fraction of Hong Kong's 6.3 million people.
Cornish said China regarded these people as holders of dual citizenship and would not recognise British consular protection for them on Chinese soil, on the mainland or in Hong Kong.
Cornish's remarks were denounced by local politicians as a sell-out. In the corridors of the Hong Kong government even the most senior officials were privately criticising Britain for what they saw as a concession to China, one source said.
On Wednesday, London and the Hong Kong government rushed to assure affected passport holders that anyone claiming sole British nationality would receive consular protection until it was proven they held dual citizenship.
But a British statement made clear Britain could not give full consular protection for people holding dual Chinese nationality once Hong Kong becomes part of China again.
British officials said the passports issued to these people were indistinguishable from any other full British passport, but many in Hong Kong are concerned that Britain may have learned that China had obtained the names of the passport hodlers.
""The only way to know for sure if one of these passports was issued under the special scheme would be if you had the names,"" a senior government source said.
The transition to Chinese rule has been dogged by disputes since the 1989 Beijing crackdown. China reacted furiously to the special passport scheme, and again when Patten introduced reforms expanding democracy in 1992.
China was infuriated last week when Britain unveiled a liberal anti-subversion bill that would set legal markers against China-style jailings of dissidents in Hong Kong.
British and Chinese senior negotiators are in the midst of a three-day bargaining session on handover details and have signalled they expect to announce accords on several issues on Friday, although the agenda has so far remained confidential.
Hong Kong is supposed to be autonomous and keep its capitalist system intact for another 50 years, but a human rights group said on Wednesday China's crackdown on dissent bode badly for the territory and its autonomy prospects were slim.
""The rule of law and human rights picture is bleak,"" said Human Rights Monitor director Law Yuk-kai on the launch of an annual human rights report.",0
"Hong Kong, wary about upsetting its future Beijing masters when dissenters use it as an escape route, kept silent on Monday about Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe following reports he had fled to the British colony.
Human rights activists in Hong Kong said Wang, 46, fled here from his home in China's neighbouring Guangdong province over the weekend, just days after the communist authorities in Beijing bundled a colleague into a labour camp.
He was expected to leave Hong Kong soon, they said, possibly by Monday night, and probably for the United States.
The U.S. Consulate declined to confirm or deny that Wang had asked for asylum. ""We don't comment on asylum cases,"" consulate spokesman Patrick Corcoran said.
Wang would be the second Chinese dissident known to have fled to the United States via Hong Kong this year. Liu Gang fled last May after months of police harassment following a six-year prison stint for helping to lead the 1989 student protest movement.
""According to our information Wang is safe at the moment,"" Robin Munro, Director of Human Rights Watch Asia, told Reuters.
""I think it's likely he'll probably be going on somewhere else fairly soon,"" Munro said.
Munro said he was unable to say where Wang was heading, but other human rights sources in Hong Kong said he was seeking refuge in the United States.
Washington has been generous in granting asylum to Beijing's political critics since a military crackdown against the student-led democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
Scores, perhaps hundreds, of Chinese dissenters have fled to the West since then through Hong Kong, local activists say.
""I assume he was about to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. I can't think what else would have prompted such a rapid departure,"" Munro said, attributing Wang's move to the three-year sentence passed on dissident Liu Xiaobo last week.
Wang and Liu sparked reprisals against remaining dissidents last month when they wrote a letter demanding the impeachment of President Jiang Zemin for violating the constitution by placing the army under Communist Party, rather than state, control.
Human rights sources said it was unlikely Wang would speak publicly in Hong Kong but that he would explain himself when he reached his destination.
As Hong Kong prepares to revert to Chinese sovereignty next July 1, issues of human rights, and especially help for mainland dissidents, have become acutely sensitive.
""The Hong Kong government asks such people to keep quiet while they are here as the price for facilitating their smooth exit from the territory,"" one human rights source said. ""And the Americans go along with that quiet, too,"" he said.
Munro saw the latest developments in China as a blow.
""It's extremely discouraging and quite deplorable the way the (Chinese) government has intensified its crackdown on the few remaining dissidents in China in recent weeks,"" said Munro.
He said the dissident movement in China had effectively been crushed, with all prominent dissidents either in jail or forced into exile.
""The saddest thing about it is that Wang appears to have concluded there's no way he could continue to struggle for change from within the country,"" Munro said.
Wang's activism dates from 1974 when he co-authored an attack in Guangdong on the radical 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
He took part in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement in Beijing and produced his own dissident newsletters. He was twice imprisoned and spent some 17 years in jail and labour camps.
He was released on parole in 1993, and before he fled he had been under constant police surveillance.",0
"Britain entered new talks with China on Hong Kong's future on Wednesday, admitting it could give no consular protection to Hong Kong people holding special British passports after the Chinese flag is hoisted in 1997.
Senior diplomats met to argue over handover details against a backdrop of disputes over a subversion law drafted by Britain and Chinese troop deployments in the British colony.
The agenda for the three-day meeting of the Joint Liaison Group (JLG) was confidential and it was not clear what, if any, agreements would be produced from the latest bargaining round.
But British chief negotiator Hugh Davies said a great effort was needed to surmount a raft of problems before the capitalist territory of 6.3 million people is handed over in 209 days.
""The subjects that we all know about...are questions such as continuity of law in Hong Kong, questions to do with right of abode, questions to to do with the international network of agreements that Hong Kong already has and which will be agreed to continue beyond 1997,"" Davies said.
His Chinese counterpart Zhao Jihua served notice that China, infuriated by the colonial government's liberal anti-subversion law last week, would not brook any more major unilateral changes in Hong Kong's legal set-up by Britain before 1997.
""During the period of the final days, we do not wish to see new troubles or new obstacles, because the remaining issues are more than enough to deal with,"" Zhao said.
""But we are still very confident, so long as the two sides sincerely cooperate with each other...we will solve all issues which are related to the transfer of Hong Kong in a timely and successful manner,"" Zhao said.
Hong Kong is to become an autonomous region of China at midnight next June 30, ending over 150 years of British colonial rule, under a treaty in which Beijing has vowed to let it keep its freewheeling capitalist system for 50 years.
In the latest of many twists in the transition, Britain's Senior Trade Commissioner, Francis Cornish, said on Tuesday London could not give consular protection to the more than 135,000 Hong Kong people holding special British passports.
Britain in 1990 granted 50,000 heads of households in Hong Kong the right to a full British passport in a concession to widespread demands for passports for all residents following Beijing's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
Cornish said China regarded these people as holders of dual citizenship and would not recognise British consular protection for them on Chinese soil.
""The Chinese have made it very clear that they regard holders of British Nationality Selection Scheme passports, when in Hong Kong and when in China, as Chinese citizens,"" he said.
British officials have also warned there could be a stampede home in June by Hong Kong people with domiciles abroad if China insists on them being present in person on handover day in order to keep their Hong Kong right of abode.
Britain's liberal bill on subversion, designed to exclude China-style jailings of dissidents, goes to the Hong Kong legislature later on Wednesday, and its fate is unpredictable.
China condemned the move last week and said such a law was the sole prerogative of the post-handover government to enact.
Earlier this week, British experts said they had failed to reach agreement with China in the JLG on Beijing's demand to send an advance party of People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to Hong Kong before the handover.
The quarrel appears to be over the size of the unit, diplomats say.
Hong Kong people have bitter memories of the PLA's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy students in Beijing in 1989.",0
"Hong Kong has arrived at the brink of history, set to name its first Chinese leader after a century and a half of British colonial rule.
At a gathering to be held under the red flag of communist-ruled China, Hong Kong's rich and mighty will meet on Wednesday to pick the first post-colonial leader -- and the smart money is on shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa.
The vote by a 400-member Chinese-controlled Selection Committee, slammed by critics as a travesty of democracy, was viewed by most in Hong Kong as a foregone conclusion.
A survey by Hong Kong University showed 82.2 percent expected Tung to win, while 43.4 percent of respondents would back him if they had the chance to vote. His nearest rival, Ti Liang Yang, would get 27.9 percent of popular support.
Sovereignty over the territory of 6.3 million people, one of Asia's economic wonders and Britain's last major colony, reverts to China at midnight next June 30 -- 203 days from now.
The winner of Wednesday's vote by the committee will become the chief executive-designate of the Special Administrative Region of China, as Hong Kong will be called from next July 1.
On the eve of the vote a small band of pro-democracy protesters camped overnight outside the conference centre.
Some politicians and diplomats fretted about China-style repression. ""The people of Hong Kong cannot trust him (Tung) to protect our rights...I cannot see how he is in a position to say no to Beijing on any important issue,"" said legislator Martin Lee.
""Unless there is a complete change in the attitude of these candidates the outlook for human rights in Hong Kong is very bad,"" said Paul Harris, head of Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor.
But the markets, a barometer of Hong Kong's fortunes, trumpeted bullish optimism. Hong Kong stocks rebounded from recent losses to end 198 points up, the index of China-linked H-shares soared to nine-month highs in the largest one-day gain in history, and forecasters predicted a 1997 property boom.
Publicly espousing ""consensus"" rather than confrontation with China, and collective duties over individual rights, and blessed by a public handshake from President Jiang Zemin in January, 59-year-old Shanghai-born Tung grabbed 206 votes in the first round of voting last month by the committee.
He only needs 201 to win the clincher on Wednesday. Some Hong Kong newspapers were already putting the finishing touches on Tuesday to a slew of Tung-the-victor profiles for Wednesday.
If he wins, he will be greeted by a no-confidence debate presented by lawmaker Emily Lau, one of China's loudest critics, in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco).
Governor Chris Patten has vowed support for the future leader, whoever he is, in the twilight of British rule.
But Tung has not responded to the plege. He has said he will consult Hong Kong's respected civil service on how best to run the territory and ensure a smooth transition.
""Nobody wants the present administration to be turned into a lame duck,"" Tung said on Monday.
If he wins, Tung will spend the next six months assembling a cabinet of advisers to guide policy. His team is expected to be highly pro-business.
He will also lay the groundwork for a provisional legislature, soon to be picked by the same Selection Committee, to take over from the present elected Legco next July 1.",0
"In an exercise dubbed by China as a ""democratic election with Hong Kong characteristics"", this bustling territory goes to the polls on Friday. But only 400 citizens out of 6.3 million people in the colony will be voting.
A 400-member Selection Committee formed under Beijing's tight rein will be inaugurated in Hong Kong with a month-long mission to elect the first post-colonial leader and the 60 members of a replacement legislature.
The committee, to be anointed by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on his first official trip to the colony, will set the tone of the government to rule Hong Kong after Britain hands its Asian pearl back to China at midnight next June 30.
Hong Kong, one of Asia's economic wonders, is to become a Special Administrative Region of communist-ruled China. Beijing has pledged to maintain the territory's thriving capitalist system intact for 50 more years under the terms of China's ""one country two systems"" reunification policy.
Pro-democracy legislators attacked the leadership candidates in a debate on Wednesday for failing to address issues of human rights and democracy and called for a real general election.
Trade unionist Lee Cheuk-yan told Hong Kong's existing legislature that a leading contender, shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, was dangerous.
""Mr Tung is the most conservative among them, and he is the most dangerous as he calls on Hong Kong people to be willing to be obedient citizens,"" Lee said.
But a motion critical of the leadership selection was defeated by the pro-Beijing camp. Several democrats were absent on a lobbying mission to London.
""Democratisation is not like instant noodles... It took hundreds of years for Western countries to develop their present democratic systems,"" pro-Beijing legislator Ip Kwok-him said.
The sovereignty transition has been frought with disputes between China and Britain, between colonial governor Chris Patten and Chinese envoys, and between Hong Kong's burgeoning democracy movement and a pro-Beijing political camp.
They have sparred over the future of Hong Kong's human rights, democracy and basic freedoms, over whether or not the commercial ""level playing field"" will continue, and over the survival of Hong Kong's autonomy and the rule of law.
But now, 229 days before the sun finally sets on Britain's empire in Asia, attention is shifting to who will be running the show for China after Patten sails away.
In the first round of the process on Friday, the Selection Committee members will propose candidates for the chief executive who will step into Patten's shoes next year.
To enter the final run-off for the job, a candidate must be nominated by at least 50 members of the committee on Friday. The committee meets again on December 11 to pick the winner.
The leading candidates are all acceptable to China, sources close to the committee say.
In the forefront of the leadership battle are Tung and former chief judge Ti Liang Yang. An opinion poll gave Yang a 10 percentage point lead over Tung in public popularity this week.
Businessman Peter Woo and former appeals judge Simon Li came a remote third and fourth, and four other little known candidates scored less than one percent in the public's ratings.
However, it is not the public who vote, but the committee, and inside that body the real lobbying campaign is unfolding.
""We have a process which is laid down and I think it's clear the polls don't determine the winner,"" said Woo.
The committee was formed in Beijing two weeks ago and is dominated by pro-Beijing political and business groups.",0
"China is poised to take a major step in reversing democratic reform in Hong Kong by creating a new legislature to replace the territory's elected body when Beijing resumes control of the British colony next year.
The die will be cast on Saturday when 400 Hong Kong people, carefully screened by China, meet over the border in the city of Shenzhen to appoint 60 legislators who will make Hong Kong's laws from July 1.
The ""provisional legislature"" will be installed after China disbands the elected Legislative Council (Legco) in a move to roll back political reforms introduced by Beijing's nemesis, departing colonial governor Chris Patten, since 1992.
The body that will choose the new parliamentarians is the Selection Committee, which also elected Tung Chee-hwa, a 59-year-old shipping tycoon with strong pro-Beijing loyalties, to succeed Patten as chief executive of the territory of 6.3 million people.
China resumes control of Hong Kong at midnight on June 30 next year, ending more than 150 years of British rule.
The Hong Kong public, who voted resoundingly for pro-democracy groups in Legco elections last year, have had no vote in the two selection processes organised by China and no say in the decision to remove the elected legislature.
The Sino-British quarrel over the provisional legislature set Tung and Patten on a collision course this week.
""A quarter of those who are lining up for jobs in this institution were beaten in regular elections ... It will be a blot on the first months of Chinese rule,"" Patten told a newspaper. ""This echo chamber has no place in the political or administrative life of Hong Kong ... We will have nothing to do with it any form.""
Tung responded in a speech to the business community by saying Britain must ""face the reality"" of the new legislature. He warned that if its legitimacy was challenged further he would get China's parliament to legislate on its legality.
Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy group, the Democratic Party, is boycotting the selection process, which it brands as a plot to snuff out democracy and enact repressive laws.
""You won't find five of them who can be called democrats by any stretch of the imagination,"" Democratic Party leader Martin Lee told Reuters, commenting on the candidates.
The Democratic Party has expelled a rebel member, Dominic Chan, because he broke ranks to run for the new assembly.
The party is organising two days of protests against the provisional legislature, and China has beefed up security on the border in case demonstrators try to cross into Shenzhen, local media quoted Chinese sources as saying.
The Selection Committee will choose the 60 members of the provisional legislature from a list of 130 candidates.
Pro-Beijing parties fielding candidates denied critics' allegations this week that they had negotiated the result of the voting in advance in under-the-table horse-trading.
""There is definitely no carve-up of seats,"" said Liberal Party leader Allen Lee.
Each Selection Commitee member will vote by endorsing up to 60 names from among the candidates. The top 60 candidates -- those listed the most times -- will be appointed to the provisional legislature.
Among the candidates are 34 incumbent legislators, raising the prospect that Legco could be crippled well before Chinese rule, because the two legislatures' schedules could clash.
A poll by Hong Kong University indicated on Thursday that one-third of the public support the concept of the new legislature and one-quarter trust the Chinese government.",0
"Shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa was to fly to Beijing on Tuesday to be anointed by China's communist leadership as Hong Kong's first Chinese leader when Britain pulls out in mid-1997.
Tung was to head for the Chinese capital in the afternoon after addressing Hong Kong's business community in his first major speech since he was selected as the territory's future chief executive last Wednesday.
In Beijing, he will have his first face-to-face meeting with China's President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng since formally launching his bid for Hong Kong's leadership mantle two months ago.
It was Jiang who signalled in January this year that Tung was Beijing's favourite for the job when he singled out the tycoon for a warm, personal handshake at a reception in Beijing.
Britain is returning its last major colony to its former and future masters in Beijing at midnight next June 30, after a century and a half of colonial rule that turned it into one of Asia's economic marvels with a population of 6.3 million people.
One of Tung's first tasks in the twilight of British rule will be to cobble together an advisory cabinet called the Executive Council and to decide which senior mandarins to keep.
He has said he will start this task after his China visit, reinforcing speculation in Hong Kong that China will call the shots from behind the scenes on the make-up of the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
""If he waits before deciding on his team, there will be lingering doubts as to whether he was acting on instructions received from Beijing,"" the South China Morning Post said in its main editorial on Tuesday.
On Monday, the colonial government said it would set limits on how much it would help Tung to form a government-in-waiting before the transfer of sovereignty.
Constitutional Affairs Secretary Nicholas Ng told the Legislative Council that the government ruled out a mass exodus of senior officials to the government-in-waiting because it would undermine the stability and efficiency of the present administration.
The colonial administration is supposed to cooperate with the incoming government under the handover agreement.
But the transition has been fraught with disputes over issues ranging from human rights and democracy to infrastructure projects, darkening prospects for serious cooperation.
Many senior civil servants, including Chief Secretary Anson Chan, who is Governor Chris Patten's deputy, and Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, stayed away from a business dinner party attended by Tung on Monday night, though they had been invited.
Officials said Chan and Tsang had scheduling conflicts but political analysts said it might have been a sign that the administration's top two civil servants would not keep their jobs.
The 400-member, Beijing-controlled Selection Committee that selected Tung last week is now preparing for the next milestone in the march to Chinese rule -- the selection on Saturday of a 60-member, pro-China ""provisional legislature"" with which China plans to replace the existing, elected legislature on July 1.
Patten again condemned the new legislature in an interview with the French newspaper Liberation on Monday, saying he would never cooperate with it.
""This echo chamber has no place in the political or administrative life of Hong Kong,"" he said.",0
"A planned merger between British brewer Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley will create such a dominant force in the industry that it is almost certain to fall foul of Britain's competition authorities, regional brewers said on Tuesday.
""I think it will be referred but what will happen then is anybody's guess. They must think there is a reasonable risk of that happening otherwise why have a plan B in place,"" said Ralph Findlay, finance director of Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries.
On Sunday Bass confirmed details of a long-awaited deal to merge with Carlsberg-Tetley, leaving Danish brewer Carlsberg with a 20 percent stake in a merged Carlsberg-Tetley-Bass if British regulators allow the marriage to take place.
Under the terms of the deal, if Bass cannot combine C-T with its own brewing business within 16 months, Bass has the option to put its whole shareholding to Carlsberg and Carlsberg has an option to put 15 percent of C-T to Allied Domecq.
""If it doesn't work it seems plan B comes into operation. But it is by no means clear what will invoke plan B,"" Findlay said.
Bass was knocked off its perch as Britain's leading brewer last year when Scottish & Newcastle (S&N) acquired Courage from Australian brewer Fosters, giving it a 31 percent share of Britain's beer market.
A merger of Bass and Carlsberg-Tetley would make Bass Britain's largest brewer by far with 35 percent of the market.
Britain's competition authorities will want to find out if the deal would leave Bass and S&N too much control over beer prices and too powerful a grip in the Midlands and Yorkshire.
Roger Young, retail director at Greenalls Group, said: ""In common with the rest of the world we are expecting a referral. Anything that takes competition out on the supply side is not good news from the point of view of the purchaser.""
Greenalls, owners of some 2,400 pubs, exited brewing at the end of February 1991. ""If it becomes too much for Bass to swallow then I suppose plan B swings in -- Carlsberg effectively takes over,"" he told Reuters.
Many brewing analysts argue that the duopoly that exists in Scotland between Bass and S&N results in much higher margins for the brewers which means higher prices for drinkers.
""I think the supply position in the Midlands and Yorkshire is obviously something that needs to be looked at very carefully,"" said one senior source at regional brewer.
""Because Bass and Allied have dominated the beer supply in those areas since the Second World War.""
""In those areas they are the two biggest brewers and the two biggest brewers getting together in very significant regions like that is something which has never happened before.""
A spokesman for the Office of Fair Trading confirmed it would look at the deal but declined to comment on whether the OFT would recommend referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for a full investigation.
Industry sources say although S&N's purchase of Courage was referred the OFT gave the company much clearer guidance on what concessions would be required to let it through.
S&N was obliged to reduce its tied estate of pubs by 115 to 2,624. It also agreed to the early release of IEL (Intrepreneur Estates Ltd) pub tenants from a supply agreement. It had to release 500 of them by January 1996 and a further 500 by January 1997.",0
"Britain's Northern Foods sees world dairy commodity prices as unlikely to improve in the second half but the impact of this on earnings should be partly offset by improved margins on prepared foods, said Jo Stewart, managing director of the company's prepared food division.
""There is no immediate prospect of commodity prices improving in the second half. We are also very driven by the strength of sterling aginst other currencies,"" Stewart said in a telephone interview after the firm reported first half results.  
In the first half prices on the world commodity markets for butter, skimmed milk and bulk cream were off some 20 percent on last year's levels.
Weakening world demand for dairy productes and the rise in sterling against the other marjor European currencies was not offset by a reduction in Northern's cost of milk.
Eden Vale Food Ingredients, which sells by-products of milk production like butter, skimmed milk powder and cream, on world commodity markets was the hardest hit of Northern's divisions.  
Overall, however margins recovered on the company's prepared foods business rising one percentage point to 8.0 percent in the first half and there was room for further improvement in the second half, Stewart said.
""Our markets have been strengthening in general. We have seen stronger consumer demand, a trend we expect to continue at least until the end of our fiscal year.""
Northern achieved four percent price inflation on its prepared foods in the first half, compared with zero last year, and so far consumers have not reacted to price increases by curbing their demand, said Stewart.  
A typical pack of Northern's biscuits is now 2p higher at 51p than six months ago.
The impact of the beef crisis on consumers demand for beef and meat pies and in turn on Northern's operating profit should lessen in the second half to 2.0-3.0 million, said Stewart.
Sales of Northern's meat products were off 6.8 percent in the first half as shoppers continued to worry about a link between mad-cow disease and a similar brain wasting disease in humans. Northern estimated the beef crisis cost it about 3.0 million pounds in the first half.  
""The impact of BSE is likely to be a little less in the second half as we have put products in the market that can take the same role. We now use chicken, lamb or pork in a pie.""
Before the beef crisis about 55 percent of Northern's hot pies were beef against 40 percent today. Pies are more important to Northern in the winter months of the second half year.
Competition in supplying milk to supermarkets remains intense but the recent erosion in prices should stop soon, said Stewart. ""The profitability of that sector is now such that people are losing money and we expect the price erosion to stop,"" he said.  
Northern now supplies about 33 percent of all milk in supermarkets, haing lost about two percentage points of market share in the first half.
Robert Wiseman and fast-expanding Danish dairy products group MD Foods were especially keen on pricing of milk to supermarkets in the first half.
On Tuesday Unigate said its sales of milk to supermarkets fell 2.4 percent in the first half and dairy profits fell 2.9 million stg to 17.6 million due to lower prices for butter and milk powders, which Unigate estimated cost it about 4.0 million in the period.
Northern reported dairy profits down 27 percent at 21.6 million in the six months ended September 30.
Profits from its prepared foods division were up 24.2 percent at 43.1 million, driven hardest by the grocery sector which benefitted from a full six month contribution from Green Isle which sells the Goodfella pizza brand.",0
"Gareth Davies, chief executive of British cigarette maker Imperial Tobacco, which de-merged from conglomerate Hanson in October, said on Thursday it was difficult to see growth in Britain, although it hoped to make this up by expansion in the Asia- Pacific region.
""In Britian it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world,"" he said.  
Earlier, Imperial posted profits of 303 million stg from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.
Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November Budget. After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent to 81 billion.
Davies said he expected the same sort of fall again. He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.",0
"Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, demerged from Hanson Plc in October, said on Thursday it's future was bright although British market growth was tough due to escalating taxes on cigarettes.
""In Britain it is difficult to see the market growing given the punitive taxes. We are likely to see continued strong growth, though, in the Asia Pacific area of the world,"" chief executive Gareth Davis said in an interview.
Imperial posted trading profits of 303 million pounds ($491.8 million) from Britain in the year ended September 28, unchanged from its 1995 level, but profits from overseas grew 55 percent to 70 million.
Overall group profits before tax for the year were up five percent at 366 million pounds. The company's shares rose 5-1/2p to 373-1/2p.
Britain's Finance Minister, Kenneth Clarke, announced an increase of 15p on a packet of 20 cigarettes in his November 26 budget.
After a similar rise in 1995, British cigarette sales fell by 2.5 percent and Davis said he expected the same sort of fall again.
He said the latest tax rise would fuel smuggling by widening further the gap between taxes in Britain and mainland Europe.
The company's profits from overseas, which now make up 19 percent of total group profits, are targeted to reach 25 percent by the end of the decade, said Davis.
""I think we are in a world market which is still in growth, albeit modest, and Imperial is a relatively late entrant to international markets and has tremendous potential to exploit its brands internationally.""
In 1995, Imperial's set-up costs in emerging markets were about 9.0 million pounds before falling to around half that in 1996, said Davis, and its overseas investment is likely to remain at around that level each year until 2000.
He said the company was confident of its defence against 12 lawsuits bought in Britain by people who allege their health has been damaged by smoking its products.
""We have very strong defences and great confidence in those defences and we will defend each and any claim aganst us with the upmost vigour.""",0
"Family-controlled British food and retailing group Associated British Foods should report a sharp rise in full year profits on Monday, as its retail and textile business benefit from a pickup in high street spending.
""The two parts of the business really driving the increase are the retail and clothing side which is benefitting from the feel-good factor,"" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. Analysts forecasts are centred on pretax profits of 415 million stg up from 375 million last time and a dividend increase to 9.5p from 8.8p.  
ABF, a food processor and manufacturer in Britain, Australia and the United States, as well as a food and textile retailer in Britain and Ireland, is also widely expected to yield yet more cash from British Sugar.
""The feature of the figures as ever is the strong cashflow coming out of British sugar. Net cash should rise by about 130 million pounds which always begs the question will they spend it?"" said UBS analyst Charlie Mills.
That would bring net cash to 735 million stg at year end.  
On the retail side PriMark, women's clothing chain in Ireland and Britain, as well as the Irish retailing businesses -- Stewarts supermarkets in Northern Ireland and Crazy Prices and Quinnsworth -- are expected to perform much better.
However the mainstream side of the business, British Sugar which contributes about 50 percent of profits, is likely to be slightly weaker after a hot summer in 1995 affected the sugar beet crop and margins came under pressure from the strength of sterling which made European imports look cheaper.  
Aside from British sugar, analysts expect the grocery business, like milling and baking, Rivita and Burton biscuits to show improvements.
On average analysts forecast trading profit from groceries, excluding British Sugar, to rise by 14 million stg to 82 million in the belief that the company has managed to claw back some of the margin on non-packaged food.
Including British Sugar operating profits are predicted to increase to about 265 million from 252 million previously.
ABF shares have risen consistently from 280p in January to 418-1/2p at Friday's close.
Consensus estimates, taken from a Reuter poll of 17 brokers, for 1996 is 30.1, rising to 31.6 in 1997.
The company has a return on equity of 11.5 percent, putting it in 28th slot in the FTSE-All share food manufaturing sector of 57 companies.",0
"John McGrath, chief executive of food and drinks giant Grand Metropolitan Plc said the company will continue to unshackle itself from production in its mission to bear down on costs.
""In many cases we don't need to produce what we sell,"" McGrath told Reuters. ""Whether you own the processing is often academic as long as you control the quality.""
The company is looking at further Seneca-type deals in the next year, he said, where a third party takes on the production but GrandMet keeps hold of pricing, marketing and quality.  
Last year, GrandMet contracted out to U.S. company Seneca the processing and packaging of its Green Giant's canned vegetables. Green Giant was acquired as part of Pillsbury, GrandMet's U.S. food arm, in 1989.
Pillsbury currently produces some 75 percent of what it sells and this number will decline in the future.
If a product can be insulated by patent from the competition, then GrandMet would want to continue making it, said McGrath in an interview. But, if it's a bread or biscuit product, for instance, it may make economic sense to allow a third party producer in.  
""We would never get out of distilling whisky or blending... that is a skill which only a few highly skilled people can ensure. They know how to get the right quality, the right taste, the right balance. But, whether you need to bottle it yourself is another matte,"" McGrath said.
""The best example is Coca-Cola who are brand marketeers, brand owner and controllers of the concentrate. But, whether they own the processing is academic as long as they control the quality.""  
McGrath paid tribute to former chairman Lord Sheppard, who stood down as chairman in March, after 21 years with the group, for transforming GrandMet into a leaner, more focused company.
When Sheppard took over in 1987, he found a company with over 30 very different business which he thinned down to three: food, drinks and Burger King retailing.
McGrath, appointed chairman and chief executive of International Distillers and Vintners (IDV), GrandMet's spirits arm, in September 1993, brought a tough, cost-conscious urge to make Sheppard's vision work.  
McGrath, whose management skills stem from the shopfloor and operations rather than boardroom, separates himself from the culture of GrandMet's heady, deal-making days of the last decade when companies were carved up and sold on in droves.
""The view I take which the board strongly supports is concentrating on making those very expensive assets that we have acquired work highly efficiently.""
""Now is the time to concentrate on organic growth very strongly supported by new brand development. We will only make minor acquisitions chiefly in emerging markets or food service in the U.S. where we can get some good returns,"" he said.
""What I am very much concentrating on now is taking all the action we possibly can to as rapidly as possible increase our return on capital,"" said McGrath.
""We are investing for the medium term and no longer for short term gain,"" he said.",0
"Larry Pillard, chief executive of British sugar and starch producer Tate and Lyle, said on Wednesday the company's beleagured North American unit Staley should benefit from improved market conditions this year.
""Conditions have reversed this year so that corn milling companies can divert some of their excess capacity into ethanol and that could tighten up the market a bit,"" he said.
Wet corn miller Staley posted a 50 percent fall in earnings because of a record increase in maize costs, dragging down group pretax profits for the year by some 35 million to 276.3 million.",0
"Family controlled food and retailing group Associated British Foods reported a 15 percent increase in its full year profits on Monday, but chairman Garry Weston sounded a wary note when asked about the year ahead.
""I never play hostage to fortune. I've always been cautious,"" said Weston in an interview. ""It's a very bad time to forecast anything with two elections coming up -- in the United States and Britian. We have no idea how they will impact on us.""  
ABF posted pretax profits of 430 million pounds ($704.1 million) for the year ended September 14 whereas most stockmarket forecasts had centred on 415 million.
Worldwide sales were up 17 percent to 5.707 billion. Profits were driven by an especially strong performance from the company's retail operations in Britain and Ireland. Operating profits rose 25 percent to 69 million, with the company's supermarkets in Ireland further increasing their market share.
Primark, the women's textile chain, included results from One Up stores bought from Storehouse last year.  
""We got the fashion right. Primark has been refurbished and that improved its buying power and gave it more notice on the high street."" In the second half Primark was more in tune with public demand, said Weston.
ABF's food manufacturing and processing operations in Britain showed an 8.0 percent sales growth to 3.11 billion pounds and a 12 percent profits increase to 282 million.
However, operating profits from British Sugar fell to 183 million. British Sugar sales are limited by European community quotas and the renewed strength of the pound made imports from mainland Europe look cheaper in the second half.  
AFB's profits from its Australia and New Zealand operations increased by 20 percent to 38 million.
AC Humko, acquired from Kraft Foods in September 1995, chipped in its first full year of profits to ABF's north American business to help turn a 3.0 million loss in 1995 to a six million stg profit.
Analysts were surprised by the stronger than expected performance from ABF's milling and baking business where margins improved strongly. ABF owns the Twining group of companies, Burtons Biscuits, Allied Bakeries and an animal feed business.  
""They were good numbers a bit ahead of our figures, but it will be hard to match that in the current year,"" said Michael Bourke, analyst at Panmure Gordon. ""The green pound rate is likely to mean a reduction in British Sugar profits and inflation in food prices looks very subdued,"" he said.
ABF shares rose 8p to 426p on the news.
Net cash held by the company rose by 196 million to 797 million at September 14, after spending 242 million on its assets and acquisitions during the year.
The company is keen to expand in the Far East and although ABF's history is one of expansion by organic growth if the oppurtunity arises it will make acquisitions, said Weston.
""We have been picking up acquisitions and if opportunities come along for something big then we will take it,"" he said.",0
"Peter Jarvis, chief executive of brewer to leisure group Whitbread Plc, said the company is seeing fairly strong growth in consumer spending on leisure.
Jarvis said although consumer spending has been positive for the last 12 months, it was masked somewhat by expenditure on the National Lottery which took out 5.0 billion stg from the economy last year, equal to about 5.0 percent of total leisure spending in Britain.
""So all of the natural growth there would have been last year was missing,"" he told Reuters in an interview.  
""So the feelgood factor was not there and the main reason was the diversion of expenditure into the Lottery. But the comparables now don't have the Lottery effect in and we have got back into quite strong growth in leisure expenditure,"" he said.
The improvement was evident across all areas of its activity although Jarvis was especially encouraged by the hotels business.
""The hotel market in this country is very buoyant. The growth in expenditure in hotels far outstrips growth in new accomodation. And that is about more travel, more tourism, more retired people, more affluent retired people.""  
Whitbread acquired health and sports club group David Lloyd Leisure for about 200 million stg and a chain of 16 Marriot hotels in Britain for about 185 million last August.
""We are making very good progress in our hotel business. Our profits are substantially ahead of last year and our customers are recognising the improvements that have been made to our hotels through joining up with Marriot,"" he said.
""The performance of the Marriot hotels we bought has improved against last year as well as the performance of Whitbread hotels that have been transferred to Marriot.""  
Whitbread opened about 45 new budget hotels called Travel Inns during the year to March 2 and Jarvis said they this part of the hotels arm was performing well. ""The occupancy levels we are getting in our budget hotels now are higher than they have ever been since we started out in this business,"" Jarvis said.
He said the Marriot company would contribute substantially to the earnings of Whitbread, even after interest payments.
""If we paid 185 million for Marriot, and you can work out the interest, I am saying we will make many millions beyond that in the current year. And this is the first full year we have had Marriot,"" he said.  
""Next year David Lloyd will be in that kind of position and I think that Pelican will be as well,"" he added.
Whitbread announced an agreed 133 million stg bid for the Pelican Group of cafes in the UK in July.
""This year if you take Marriot and you take our Travel Inns we will make broadly as much money in hotels as we make in beer,"" Jarvis said.
The beer company reported operating profit of 44.9 million stg in 1995/96, a rise of some 4.5 million on the previous year, but just 15 percent of the company's total operating profit.  
Whitbread's restaurants and inns division, which includes Marriot hotels, reported trading profit of 88.3 million up from 66.0 million.
The company is due to report half-year results on November 5.",0
"British clothing retailer Burton on Thursday showed off a 54 percent full year profit rise, breaking all stockmarket forecasts, and said shoppers were happier now than at any time since the early 1990's.
Pretax profits rose to 151.6 million pounds ($249 million) in the year to August 31 from 98.6 million on sales up 7.1 percent to 2.0 billion. The group raised its full-year dividend by 27 percent to 2.8 pence a share.
Chairman Sir John Hoskyns said all the group's divisions had reported an increase in full-year profits.
""This performance reflects the success of the trading strategies and continued brand building in every division,"" he said in a statement.
The retailer has had a long struggle to boost profit margins in what was until recently a depressed retail market. But the group has achieved a major turnaround.
Finance director Andrew Higginson said there was scope for more improvement in margins, although at a slower pace.
""There is still some scope for margin improvement this year, but be it at a lower pace. It will ease back somewhat from where we are at the moment,"" he told Reuters.
Higginson described the current trading environment as better than anything seen since the early 1990's, although he said it was certainly not booming.
Burton's Debenhams department store chain produced a 21 percent increase in profits to 102.8 million pounds. Hoskyns said the department store was set for a 20 percent increase in space over the next four years.
All the group's fashion stores, including Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins, made profits. Burton Menswear and Principles both moved back into the black after making losses last year.
Burton's shares rose on the better-than-expected results. The stock stood 1.5 pence higher at 146.5.
""The figures were at the top end of forecasts and we are still positive on the stock,"" said one senior trader.
Analysts had expected pre-tax profit of between 139.0 million and 149 million pounds.
Burton has just moved into home shopping via the acquisition of mail order group Innovations in August and Racing Green in October. But Higginson said the main focus of the group would remain with its stores.",0
"Ice cream had a sad time in Europe this summer, adding fresh impetus for the big makers to try to persuade us to eat it in the winter.
""We think for Unilever its meant 125 million pounds ($198.4 million) in lost sales and lost profits of 50 million in the summer months across europe,"" said David Lang, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
The dull summer has hit impulse purchases of ice creams worst of all, a high-margin sector that makes up one third of all European ice cream sales.
Coca-Cola, sometimes taken as a benchmark for consumer spending behaviour, reported a 10 percent decline in case sales in Germany, 17 percent down in Britain and four percent down in France as a result of the poor summer.
It's no surprise then to find marketing executives at Wall's and Nestle scurrying for new products to sell in the winter months.
Britain's Birds Eye Wall's, owned by Unilever, said it has launched seven new lines across its impulse, take-home and multipack sectors as chocolate indulgences for the winter months.
Nestle is trying to roll out products like its Christmas Log in France to even out the seasonal swing in sales.
Both companies argue if people in Norway and Sweden, where the climate is cooler, can eat twice as much ice cream than in Britain, then there is work to be done.
""The snag is that in summer when people are on holiday that is when impulse sales are always at their highest, people just don't associate having an ice cream with winter,"" said John Campbell, an analyst at Paribas.
Industry watchers also point out that children, who account for 40 percent of all impulse icecream sales, take their longest holidays in the summer.
Wall's, the largest player in the British icecream market worth about 1.0 billion pounds estimates some 60 million pounds of the market growth in 1995 came from the very hot summer.
Wall's brands account for 17 out of the top 20 selling impulse brands with Wall's Solero heading up the league followed by Magnum White and Magnum Classic.
In terms of total market share Wall's has 43 percent in Britain, Nestle Lyons Maid 12 percent, Mars 7 percent, own label 29 percent and others 9 percent.
In a week of indifferent summer weather Wall's sells about 23 to 25 million portions of icecream whereas in a hot sunny week this figure can rise to around 55 million portions.
The big players in the 15 billion pounds European icecream market have come down with a thud from the summer of 1995.
It was the third hottest summer on record in Europe and August the hottest and sunniest ever -- with long periods of temperatures above 16 degrees centigrade, at which point consumers really switch into buying icecream.
Temperatures soared to an average 17.5 degrees centigrade in Britain with 7.8 hours of sunshine a day compared with 7.2 hours in 1996. Statistics from the MetOffice, Britain's national weather centre, show an average temperature of 15.9 degrees for the summer of 1996. The office says the South of France and Spain had just an average summer this year.
Nestle, who entered the UK market in 1992 with the purchase of the Lyons Maid brand, estimates total sales in Britain are down some 5 percent at 879 million due to the dull summer, of this hand held icecreams accounted for 489 million.
In Britain the all-time Summer record for Wall's still stands at 71 million portions sold during one week in the long, hot summer of 1976 -- the year when Wall's Cornetto first hit the market.
However much the big fridge fillers spend on advertising and dreaming up new products it will be hard to break that record.",0
"Derek Pretty, finance director of troubled U.K. discount supermarket chain Kwik Save, said on Thursday a radical shake-up of the group, including the closure of 107 stores at a cost of 87.5 million stg, was the best way to ensure its future.
""We researched opportunities in other areas and we reviewed, among other options, mergers. We looked at whether we should go back to being a limited range discounter, with much lower choice, and little in terms of chilled food,"" he told Reuters.
""But that would have meant losing nine million customers.""  
He said the store closure programme would involve less than 200 job losses, as 90 percent of the staff would be redeployed in Kwik Save's remaining 900 stores.
About 1,900 work in the 107 stores to be shut. ""Yes, we are confident that the provisioning is solid and appropriate. Anything more than that would have put us in the realms of big baths and contigency buckets.""
""We have looked at this particularly carefully, the days of doing big bath provisioning have gone. We have looked very specifically at the stores we plan to close. We are confident it is the proper provision to take us forward."" he said.  
At a news conference chief executive Graeme Bowler said the company would introduce a new range of chilled foods, health and beauty products and over the counter medicines as well as widening its existing product range.
""We are going for width rather than depth in brands,"" he said. Kwik Save will have 100 own-label products in its stores from the spring 1997.
""We are not moving away from discounting prices. It is our core proposition and we will not dilute it,"" said Bowler. ""We are not trying to be a mini-version of someone else, we want to be ourselves.""  
""Kwik Save made its reputation because it sold quality products cheaply. We will not engage in selling cheap products cheaply,"" Bowler told reporters.
Stores will also be upgraded after research conducted by outside consultants Anderson Consulting, initiated in February, showed customers wanted stores to be more welcoming and easy to use, said Bowler.
Kwik Save would need to invest heavily in technology, where it was about two to three years behind the competition, said Bowler, so that, for instance, debit cards could be used at all its tills and stock levels could be better controlled.  
He acknowledged that the group had failed to invest enough in upgrading the fabric of its stores in previous years.
The new-style Kwik Save stores will be rolled out in geographical clusters over the next three years at a cost of some 300 million stg, funded from cost savings.
The 107 stores will be closed progressively next year.
Research had identified the need to beef up the management team and as a result Kwik Save has appointed a group marketing director and a supply chain director, and planned to appoint a new buying director, Bowler said.  
He stressed the underlying performance of the group remained strong, generating sales of seven billion stg over the last two years despite fierce price pressure from superstores, and a return on capital of 20 percent in line with the industry average.",0
"British dairy and distribution company Unigate Plc posted better than expected profits at the half year stage on Tuesday and said it was seeking to expand its presence as a distributor in mainland Europe.
""We have now refocused the group into food and distribution. And a lot of pan-European customers of ours are looking for us to come to them with some European capability, so one area we are looking at is distribution,"" chairman Ian Martin said.
Pretax profits in the half year to September 30 were up 0.3 percent at 60.6 million pounds ($101.1 million), better than stockmarket forecasts of 57 to 59 million. The company held cash of 58 million at September 30, giving it ample resources for acquisitions.
The company raised its interim dividend by 5.3 percent to 7.0 pence. Unigate shares were up four pence at 431p by late in the session.
Martin told a news conference: ""We tend to see the duck being thickest in Europe and that is where we are shooting at the moment.""
Chief executive Ross Buckland said in an interview that Unigate had between 200 and 300 million pounds to spend on acquisitions. ""If our interest cover went down below four times then you would have to question our cautiousness,"" he said.
He ruled out a special dividend, saying that growth by acquisition represented better value to shareholders.
""We are prepared to expand beyond areas in which we operate, into another food area, but if we did it would have to be a large and meaningful acquisition,"" said Buckland.
Unigate's European foods division reported profits up 3.1 million at 44.1 million in the first half, with fresh foods increasing profits from 20.5 million to 26.5 million pounds.
This increase was helped by the 77 million pound acquisition of Kraft's European margarines and spreads business in August.
Malton, the bacon and pork processing business, has also benefited from recent acquisitions.
In the half year, a total of 100 million was spent on acquisitions, including 20 million on the Hargrave pork products business to further strengthen Malton. Another 77 million was spect buying Kraft's Vitalite and Golden Churn brands to add to St Ivel's existing brands -- Gold and Utterly Butterly.
""I don't believe we can be accused of unwise investments over the last year,"" Buckland said.
Unigate's dairy business reported profits down 2.9 million pounds at 17.6 million due to lower prices for butter and milk powders, which Unigate estimated cost it about 4.0 million in the period. But from October, Unigate said it has seen a small reduction in raw milk prices.
Wincanton, Unigate's distribution business reported profits up 1.7 million at 12.3 million.
In August, Unigate completed its exit from the U.S. restaurant business with the sale of Taco Bueno and Casa Bonita for 27 million, enabling the company to focus purely on developing its core European food and distribution business.",0
"British cider group Matthew Clark said on Tuesday fashionable ""alcopop"" drinks had helped to wipe a third off the sales of its premium brands -- Diamond White, K and Babycham -- in the first five months of the financial year.
Matthew Clark has been hit the hardest by a surge in popularity for so-called alcopops -- alcoholic colas and lemonades -- which have proved a success with younger drinkers. Fierce price wars among rival drinks companies have also had ab affect.
Since Matthew Clark stunned the stock market in September with a profit warning that wiped more than 290 million pounds ($466 million) off its market value, investors have badgered the group to explain how it intends to win back sales.
In the long-awaited statement, Matthew Clark conceded that price wars had continued and that sales of draught cider in June and July, were 10 percent lower than during last year's hot summer. Premium brands saw sales slump 30 percent.
The group's draught cider sales were 15 percent down across the whole summer -- although current trading in cider had since stabilised. ""We expect the underlying growth within the cider market as a whole to resume,"" the company said.
But it said it expected to hold its interim dividend at nine pence when it reported half year results ending October 31.
The company's shares closed a sharp 17.5 pence higher at 317.5 pence, although far short of their year high of 804 pence.
""The thing that's made them bounce is they've said they expect to maintain the dividend. But you've got to be cautious because there's no guide as to underlying profit levels,"" said one dealer.
The company has launched a review of its marketing strategy in branded drinks, mainly Diamond White and mainstream ciders Dry Blacthorn and Gaymers Olde English. The key findings will be released in January.
In the meantime, the company said it would create the new position of marketing director, a main board appointment, and take on 40 staff in sales and marketing in its branded drinks division.
Alcopops have proved especially popular with young drinkers, forging major inroads into the British drinks market. In May, research body Euromonitor said it would be worth about 170 million pounds this year after 100 million in 1995.
Leading brands include alcoholic lemonade Hooper's Hooch, owned by Bass, and Two Dogs, marketed by Merrydown.
Drinks industry leaders agreed in January to a voluntary code of practice aimed at limiting the promotion of alcopops after the drinks sparked a storm of controversy over whether they encouraged under-age drinking.
In its last budget, the government imposed a heavy duty on ciders with an alcohol content over 7.5 percent from next year but left alcoholic colas and lemonades unaffected.",0
"Britain's largest brewer Scottish & Newcastle Plc will see more benefit from its Courage brands in its half year results due on Monday, but its holiday village business Center Parcs will hold it back, analysts said.
""The company will see an improvement from a full contribution at Courage, but what is really holding it back is Center Parcs and there could be a worry on the currency with the recent strength in the pound,"" said Nikko analyst Dermott Carr.
Analysts forecasts for pretax profits range from 178 to 198 million stg up from 154.5 million last time.  
Dividend forecasts centre on 7.0p. Brewing is expected to contribute some 80 million stg, with 45 million of this total anticipated from Courage. Courage made just 9.0 million stg in operating profit, on turnover of 298.9 million stg, to overall group profits in the first half of 1995.
S&N acquired Courage from Australian brewer Foster's in August, 1995 to create Britain's largest brewing group in a deal that cost about 550 million stg. Since then S&N has quickly set about reducing its brewing capacity by some 1.5 million barrels a year, initially by closing two breweries and shedding some 1,600 jobs.  
John Smith's Courage is now Britain's leading ale brand.
The group's Center Parcs holiday resorts are expected to suffer from continued weak consumer leisure spending in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Center Parcs made operating profit of 82.0 million stg in the year to April 28, 1995 down 2.1 percent on turnover of 365.3 million. S&N's new village at Bispinger Heide in Germany was opened against a very weak economic background in July 1995 and the cost of opening was higher than the company expected.  
Pontin's, S&N's other leisure brand, made trading profits of 3.6 million, down from 4.1 million due to the sale of four sites and major refurbishment work at two others.
The performance of its Center Parc villages in the Netherlands and Belgium were adversely affected by a lack of consumer confidence and cut price competition from operators and it responded by investing heavily in those countries.
Analysts expect this trend to have carried on into the first half of the year, forcing the leisure division to report profits down some 5.0 million at 45 million.  
The company has three Center Parcs in Britain at Nottingham in the Midlands, East Anglia and Longleat, in the west of England. It owns two in France, one in Germany, two in Belgium and six in Holland.
However, S&N's retail division, which includes the 1,600 strong chain of Chef & Brewer restaurants, should see trading profits improve by increased investment aimed at rebranding and lifting the image of some outlets.
The company's managed pub estate has been rebranded to include pub-cafe bars like Rat & Parrot and entertainment pubs like Big Hand Mo.  
The consensus of analysts forecasts for profits from the retail division rests at 88 million stg, up some 8.0 million on the first half of 1995. The division includes an estate of 740 tenanted and about 1,850 managed pubs as well as Chef & Brewer.
The company's shares have outperformed its peers by about eight percent since February, but started underperforming the FTSE100 index by some six percent since late September.
The shares were up 142p at 642 on Friday from their 500p close on January 3. Return on equity is currently running at 5.62 percent, half its 11.32 percent level in 1995, against 10.44 percent currently for Bass.  
Operating margins have fallen to 12.27 percent from 15.46 percent in 1995.
A Reuter poll of 23 brokers estimates produced a consensus estimate EPS of 44.8 for the year ended April 28, 1997 rising to 49.5 for year end 1998.",0
"Shares in Anglo-Dutch consumer group Unilever Plc rose sharply on Friday after the group posted a better-than-expected five percent rise in third quarter profits.
""I gritted myself for something rather unpleasant and its turned out very well,"" said David Lang, an analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.
The shares jumped 42-1/2p in early London trade to 1,317-1/2p after profits rose to 826 million pounds ($1.36 billion) for the quarter. The results beat analysts' forecasts which ranged from 760 million pounds to 820 million.
""I think there is quite a lot of momentum in Unilever and that is before the benefits of management reorganisation which began in September,"" said Lang.
Before an exceptional charge of 32 million pounds, mostly to reshape its newly acquired industrial cleaning business Diversey, pretax profits rose six percent to 918 million.
""The total charges were clearly lower than we expected,"" said Richard Newboult, an analyst at Lehman Brothers who forecast a total restructuring charge of 74 million with about half of that related to Diversey.
Diversey, acquired in January from Canadian brewer Molson for 360 million pounds, was merged with Lever Industrial in October to form a combined business with annual turnover of 1.15 billion and a workforce of 13,000 in 60 countries.
Unilever owns a range of household brands including washing detergent OMO, Brooke Bond tea, Ponds cosmetic cream and several ice-cream products.
""Although poor weather had a negative effect on icecream sales, other parts of the business in Europe did well,"" said Unilever press officer Mike Haines.
Analysts and stockmarket dealers agreed. Despite the impact of a dull summer on ice-cream sales and profits, Unilever still managed to improve its profit by 13 million pounds to 502 million in the three month period from improved profits in detergents, frozen foods and personal products.
""The real strength came from the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia Pacific and the strong underlying performance in North America,"" added Haines.
The Asia-Pacific region turned in a 20 million pounds increase in profits to 108 million in the third quarter, Latin America was up 14 million pounds at 79 million, while Africa and the Middle East showed a nine million rise to 56 million pounds, reflecting changes made by the group to its Nigerian business.",0
"Spirits, pubs and Dunkin' Donuts group Allied Domecq is likely to post a big drop in full-year profits on Tuesday, hit by a 320 million stg loss on the sale of its 50 percent stake in brewer Carlsberg-Tetley (C-T).
Before this exceptional charge, analysts' forecasts for pretax profits range from 560 to 581 million stg, down from 645 million last time, with most of the damage coming in Allied's spirits arm. Profits have been hit by the weak Mexican peso, tough trading conditions in the mature markets of Europe and America and de-stocking in the United States.  
The consensus forecast for the total dividend is 23.6p.
Allied sold its share in C-T to Bass in August for 200 million in cash together with its beer brands, allowing the group to quit brewing and concentrate entirely on its spirits and retailing businesses.
Allied said at the time it expected a loss on the sale of C-T of about 320 million stg.
After tax the company said it would mean a reduction in reserves of some 200 million stg.  
At Allied Domecq Spirits and Wines, many analysts are predicting a 60 million drop in trading profits from the 488 million stg recorded in 1995. Stock reduction and weak markets dented profits at the division in the first half, too.
In the United States where trade stocks of four major brands -- Kahlua, Beefeater, Courvoisier and Canadian Club -- built up last year, Allied was forced to start reducing stock levels by half a million cases which it expected to complete by the end of August 1996.
Some analysts think this de-stocking will strip 40 million stg off operating profits from the group's spirits arm.  
Trading profits from Allied's spirits and wine division dropped to 258 million stg for the six months ended February 29 from 327 million.
""Spirits will continue to show that things are tough although we are now seeing price increases of two to three percent coming in for the industry as a whole,"" said Mark Puleikis, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Allied's retailing division, which includes managed pubs as well as Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts, is expected to post only a slight improvement in profits of some eight million to 223 million.  
""Although the managed pub side will improve, let's say it will add about about 12 million pounds to give 127 million at an operating level, Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins will drag the division down,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
In franchising, poor winter weather held back same-store sales growth particularly in Baskin-Robbins during the first half.
Carlsberg-Tetley is forecast to chip in trading profits of some 65 million at the year-end up from 61 million. In the six months to 29 February 1996 it made trading profits of 25 million, an increase of 14 percent on the same half last year.  
Attention will focus on what management has to say about continued pressure from the investment community for a demerger of Allied's spirits division.
Allied shares touched a five-month high of 492p on Friday. ""Obviously people are hoping there will be some news on a demerger,"" said one analyst who chose not to be named.
""A trading demerger would really add value to the group. The City has obviously done its sums and worked out it is worth about five pounds on a post-demerger basis,"" said another.
A Reuter poll of 24 brokers shows a consenus forecast for earnings per share of 33.7p rising to 37.4 next year.",0
"B.A.T Industries, reporting a nine percent rise in nine-month profits, on Wednesday ruled out a demerger of its tobacco business despite conceding that U.S. tobacco litigation was the main issue affecting its share price.
Chief executive Martin Broughton said the company did not see value in demerging the group into separate tobacco and financial services companies.
A strategy review showed ""there was no value we could see that would be generated from a demerger,"" he told Reuters.
Profits in the nine months rose to 2.04 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) from 1.87 billion last time. Profits in the third quarter rose to 714 million from 680 million pounds.
Trading profit from financial services rose by three percent, and profits from tobacco were seven percent ahead.
Worldwide cigarette sales rose by three percent, although volumes were lower in the United States, a market where total industry sales were flat, the company said.
The growing pace of litigation claims against the company's U.S. cigarette subsidiary Brown & Williamson (B&W), and the U.S. industry in general, continues to unsettle investors and hurt B.A.T's share price.
B.A.T shares have fallen from a high of 585 pence on February 2 to below 430 pence, shedding nearly four billion pounds from the company's stockmarket value along the way.
Broughton said a demerger of Brown & Williamson would be ""highly destructive"" of shareholder value, adding there was ""no question"" that the board of directors was united on the issue.
He also played down fears over U.S. litigation. Only a few cases actually get to court although many are filed, and the company was confident of winning its appeal in the high-profile Carter case, Broughton told a meeting of company analysts.
In the case of Grady Carter, of Orange Park, Florida, a jury in Jacksonville ruled in August that B&W was negligent and made a dangerous and defective product. Carter smoked for 50 years until he was diagnosed with lung cancer.
B.A.T shares have fallen sharply since the Florida court decided to award damages of $750,000 to Carter.
Lawyer Woody Wilner, who acted for Carter in the Florida case, had promised to bring one case a month, but three have been postponed until next year and one dismissed, B.A.T said.
B.A.T was also confident of blocking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's attempts to bring tobacco regulation into line with drugs and pharmaceuticals, said Broughton.
If the FDA proposals become law, cigarettes will be classified as ""medical devices"" and would have to meet rigorous safety and sales criteria.
Responding to a recent paper in the U.S Science Magazine which claims a direct link between smoking and lung cancer at cell level, Broughton said B.A.T had no internal research which proved smoking caused lung cancer or that smoking was addictive.
""We have not concealed, we do not conceal and we will never conceal,"" he said. There was still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms of diseases attributed to smoking, he added.
Turning to the business results, B.A.T said the seven percent rise in tobacco trading profit to 1.27 billion pounds was helped by strong sales growth in the Asia Pacific and the African, Middle East and Indian subcontinent regions.
In financial servies, B.A.T said its U.S. unit Farmers continued to have an excellent year. In Britain, the Eagle Star insurance division faced fiercely competitive conditions and profits fell to 162 million pounds from 194 million.
It also suffered a 91 million pounds charge for a surge in asbestos and pollution claims in the United States.
The life insurance and investment business reported a five percent increase in profit.",0
"Scotch whisky maker Highland Distilleries posted a 14 percent fall in its full year profits on Monday, saying sales of its brand leader The Famous Grouse blend fell in Britain and the home market remained tough.
""The UK continues to be a very competitive market. However there are indications that prices are moving up with more emphasis being given to brand building activities,"" it said.
Pretax profits fell to 37.1 million pounds ($58.43 million) in the year ended August 31, 1996 down 14 percent. Before reorganisation costs, profits were flat at 36.5 million pounds, below the market forecast range of 39.2 million to 42.5 million. Highland's shares fell 10p to 332p in early trade.
The British market for Scotch whisky fell by four percent, despite a cut in excise duty in the November 1995 Budget, while sales of The Famous Grouse fell by three percent.
""These results illustrate the problem Highland has got; the fact it still makes about 60 percent of its profits out of Famous Grouse sales in the UK where the market continues to be very competitive,"" said BZW analyst Charles Winston.
In the England and Wales off trade, which represents 65 percent of the home market, the Famous Grouse market share rose 0.5 percent to 9.3 percent.
However, sales in the on-trade or in pubs and restaurants remained tough and The Famous Grouse share fell by one percentage point. But overall market share for The Famous Grouse rose slightly to 13.3 percent.
Overall export sales of The Famous Grouse were up five percent and sales in Europe rose 13 percent, with strong performances in France, Greece and the Netherlands, although conditions were more difficult in Asia.
Single malt whiskies continued to grow both at home and overseas with Highland's key brands, Highland Park from Orkney and Bunnahabhain from Islay, up 12 percent on a global basis.
Profits from associate Robertson & Baxter fell nine percent to about 10 million pounds mainly because of increased advertising behind the Cutty Sark brand.
Sales of new and mature whiskies to blenders have grown considerably with new filling orders for the calendar year 1996 up by 31 percent.
The interest charge rose by 2.8 million pounds mainly due to the cost of carrying a 26 percent shareholding in distiller Macallan-Glenlivet Plc from January 1996.
Highland and Suntory, Japan's leading Whisky distiller, already owned 51 percent of Macallan but decided in July to pay up to 88 million pounds to take control of the remaining 49 percent.

"The longer-term interests of a US$1 billion stake in Russian equity markets dictated last week's decision to unwind a controversial fund that planned to invest in Russian gas monopoly Gazprom, Regent Pacific Group Ltd said on Monday.
""We've had to sacrifice the smaller interest in Gazprom to the much bigger interest we've got in Russia overall,"" Jim Mellon, Regent Pacific's managing director, told Reuters.
Hong Kong-based Regent Pacific decided to back away last week from a dispute with Gazprom over a US$200 million fund designed to invest in the domestic shares of the gas giant.
""We don't want to get into a lengthy legal battle and jeopardise our (other) Russian funds,"" Mellon said.
""Gazprom is the biggest company (in Russia) and we certainly don't want to go up against them,"" Mellon said.
Gazprom restricts foreign investment to nine percent of share capital, which it issues in the form of American Depositary Shares.
These ADRs trade at four times the value of the domestic shares, which Regent's fund hoped to purchase because it was incorporated in Russia -- even though all the fundholders were foreign institutions.
Mellon defended the scheme on Monday as ""completely legal"" but said Regent backed away from a dispute with Gazprom after it asked Regent not to buy the domestic shares.
""There was never any question of foreigners getting their direct hands on the shares,"" said Mellon.
""If you consult any lawyer they'll tell you our scheme is absolutely watertight, completely legal, but from a practical point of view it's all very well for Regent to go up against Hambros Bank but it would be very foolish of us to go up against Gazprom,"" he added.
Regent owns between three and four percent of Hambros and has been arguing forcefully that the bank is better broken up.
Mellon said that while Hambros might enjoy prestige as one of Britain's last remaining independent merchant banks, it cannot compare with Gazprom which numbers Russia's current prime minister and energy minister among its former executives.
Regent's Gazprom fund hoped to attract fundholders keen to arbitrage the ADRs and the domestic share prices.
""I suppose the worry that Gazprom had was that people might sell the ADRs or alternatively not buy the next issue of ADRs and buy our fund instead, which was the same issue but at a much lower price,"" said Mellon.
""Or alternatively, if you were a hedge fund, you might go short the ADRs and long our fund and seek to exploit the gap.""
So far, only 1.5 percent of the foreign allotment of nine percent of share capital have been issued, Mellon said.
However, Mellon argued that the fund was Gazprom's idea in the first place and based on an arbitrage long-practiced by Russian brokers.
Timing was probably the root cause of the difficulty.
""Only once we got the money did they come out against it,"" Mellon said. ""One suspects its definitely in their interest longer-term to have the local share price higher versus the offshore price. In the immediate term it's not in their interest because they wanted to raise more ADRs.""
Gazprom's domestic shares were trading at about US$0.645 on Monday against US$0.53 last week. The London-traded ADRs, equivalent to 10 underlying shares, at US$17.35 against more than US$20.00 last week.",0
"Hong Kong business groups hit back on Wednesday at attempts to link China's permanent most favoured nation (MFN) trading perks with how Beijing handles Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control later this year.
U.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe, leading a 22-member delegation from the House of Representatives to Beijing, said on Tuesday the United States will probably want to monitor Hong Kong for at least a year before granting China permanent MFN status.
""If MFN were conditioned or taken away, especially during the transition period, it would clearly have a devastating effect and make it much more likely that all the things we want for Hong Kong would not be achieved,"" said Mark Michelson, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.
China currently enjoys MFN, subject to annual review.
Hong Kong, which depends heavily on China-U.S. trade, fully supports China's application for full MFN status, which would allow China the same treatment as other big U.S. trading partners without the annual review.
""MFN should be the norm rather than a favour,"" said Selina Yen at the Hong Kong government's trade and industry branch.
""To us, MFN status is not a privilege. It should be granted to everybody as a normal trading basis. This is our position.""
But few in Hong Kong expect to see China win full MFN status in 1997, the year that China takes back Hong Kong from Britain.
""It's unfortunate. Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status,"" said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.
""But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude.""
Legislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.
China, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe's congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.
Political analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.
""Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No,"" said one analyst, who declined to be identified.
""But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn't hurt.""
China's annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.
However, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China's human rights record in 1995.",0
"World bankers and economic chiefs held Hong Kong up as a financial showcase with a rosy future on Friday, but a clash of views between Britain and China over democracy augured a politically bumpy ride.
Speaker after speaker at a one-day International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting stressed the importance of the economic policies that allowed Hong Kong to transform itself from an isolated island in the South China Sea into a teeming metropolis dedicated to wealth, prosperity and commerce.
""The policy framework in Hong Kong now and after the transition of sovereignty could hardly be better,"" IMF managing director Michel Camdessus said in his closing remarks.
And instead of a list of recommendations wrapping up the day's discussion of the difficulties hampering Asia's economic emergence, the day ended with a challenge from Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam to return after the British-ruled territory returns to China on July 1.
Yam asked delegates to attend the World Bank/IMF annual meeting in September to see for themselves that the ""one country, two systems"" policy guiding Hong Kong's transition to China was actually working.
""You will be able to see for yourselves that the dynamism of Hong Kong has not and will not change,"" Yam said, adding that the IMF's decision to hold its 1997 annual meeting in Hong Kong was ""a resounding vote of confidence"" in its future.
The IMF meeting will be the first major gathering of world leaders in Hong Kong following China's takeover.
More than 50,000 delegates are expected at a venue still under construction. Encased in bamboo scaffolding, Hong Kong's new convention centre only recently gained a partial roof, testament to the territory's speedy construction methods.
The meeting is expected to provide China with a showcase for the handover, which was evident in less obvious ways at Friday's IMF gathering, too.
Departing colonial governor Chris Patten started the day with a sideswipe at Beijing, telling delegates that Hong Kong's economic success was due largely to its increasingly democratic government.
""The government has responded (positively) to that process and to the changes in aspirations which have accompanied it, by welcoming ever wider public participation in the process of government,"" Patten said.
Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's incoming chief executive, ended the day with a reminder of traditional Chinese values of cooperation.
""Within our community of Asian countries we must forge cooperation through dialogue and understanding,"" he said in closing remarks.
To help foster this mood of cooperation, Tung pledged to visit his Asian neighbours soon.
""As soon as possible, I hope to be able to visit our neighbours in Asia to extend my hand of friendship and cooperation.""
Yam cemented the day's upbeat handover theme with a reminder that, in economic terms, the ""one country, two systems"" policy was little more than maintenance of the status quo.
""Under these arrangements there will be one country, two currencies, two monetary systems and two monetary authorities which are to be mutually independent,"" he said.
""These arrangements are admittedly new but definitely not as novel and complex as EMU (European Monetary Union) with one currency for many countries,"" he added.
But as a reminder that things are changing irrevocably after 150 years of British rule, many of Hong Kong's colonial administrators were on their way home after seeing their careers cut short by ""localisation"".
Many expatriates were sailing on two of the world's greatest cruise liners, the QE2 and the Oriana, a dramatic reminder that an era is ending and that Hong Kong itself will soon be sailing in uncharted waters.",0
"Thailand's banking sector crisis brought repeated calls for an upgrade of Asia's immature financial infrastructure at an International Monetary Fund-Hong Kong Monetary Authority meeting on Friday.
""Asia needs a stronger, more dynamic financial infrastructure,"" IMF managing director Michel Camdessus told the conference on financial integration in Asia.
The region's banking system has not kept pace with its economic development, and the speedy pace of economic reform has created an urgent need for an overhaul, delegates said.
""In many countries, in Asia and elsewhere, prudential regulation and supervision have not kept pace with the new complexities of the banking business,"" Camdessus said.
""If left unaddressed, this gap could pose dangers for domestic and external stability. Indeed, all countries must be vigilant about the strength of their banking systems, so that the monetary authorities can tighten policy when needed, without fear of aggravating banking sector problems.""
Asset quality problems forced Thailand to intervene earlier this week to demand better provisioning by its banks. Thailand was hampered in dealing with the situation by its monetary policy. Its currency, the baht, is pegged to a basket of currencies dominated by the dollar, but was under pressure from speculators who were encouraged by Thailand's poor economic picture and weak financial sector.
Lower rates would have eased liquidity -- but would also have lowered the cost of borrowing for currency speculators.
Higher interest rates to ward off the speculators would have increased the cost of borrowing for the cash-strapped banks.
While most speakers stopped short of calling for regional banking regulation and supervision to prevent the same situation occurring elsewhere -- an idea mooted by Australia recently -- some experts recommended frequent and regular gatherings of central bankers and finance ministers.
""Most countries need to take steps to strengthen the official supervisory oversight of financial institutions and markets,"" said Gerald Corrigan, managing director at Goldman Sachs and a former president of the New York and member of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Key to the debate are capital inflows, which have widened current account deficits across Asia with serious implications for external balances and interest rates.
Corrigan warned that while many Asian nations with wide current account deficits have taken comfort from large foreign exchange reserves, the capital inflows responsible for much of their foreign exchange can evaporate overnight.
""Deregulation has also led to a greater exposure of credit and foreign exchange risk, and increased the danger of banks being inadequately capitalised with consequent incentives to offer above-market interest rates and engage in less prudent lending,"" said Mahmood Pradhan, a senior economist with the IMF.
The situation is becoming more urgent as more and more nations in the region seek financing for the sort of huge infrastructure projects on which their future depends, he said.
""The challenge is for many of these countries to address their infrastructure needs, including environmental requirements, without putting undue strains on public finances or on external positions,"" Pradhan said.
Although many Asian nations have successfully raised capital through privatisations, the amount of capital raised through privatisation in Asia was relatively small compared with Latin America, he said.",0
"Twentieth Century Fox joined the hunt for a larger slice of the Asia-Pacific video market on Thursday by announcing a new regional office in Hong Kong for its home entertainment division.
""We believe this is an under-developed market and therefore represents one of the best growth opportunities we have,"" said Jeffrey Yapp, president of Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment International. Twentieth Century Fox is owned By News Corp Ltd.
The new regional headquarters, which forms a crucial part of Fox's recent restructuring, will oversee marketing and distribution for video subsidiaries in Japan, Korea, Australia and India.
""In the last two years, Fox Home Entertainment International has completely restructured the way we do business,"" Yapp said.
""We set out to establish regional offices to provide a regional focus and give us an opportunity to better coordinate local efforts,"" he said.
About US$2 million has been spent and 15 people hired as part of the expansion into Asia, which accounts for 38 percent of the video division's revenue and contains its largest territory in terms of revenue contribution, Japan.
""It's for sure Japan is our major market and ahead of Hong Kong but this is a regional office and Hong Kong is the place in Asia to put your regional office,"" said Marc Cudennec, senior vice-president at Fox Home International.
The international focus was one of three critical strategies adopted in a drastic overhaul of Twentieth Century Fox 18 months ago, Yapp said.
""Fox realized that to become the premier filmed entertainment company, it had to focus on the international market place,"" he said.
Yapp said Asia's rising revenue contribution played a big role in reinforcing the importance of international expansion, as did an evening out of theatrical revenues from a prior ratio of 30 percent international, 70 percent U.S.
Fox's two other restructuring strategies, setting up four distinct production units and beefing up executive and creative talent, are well underway and reaping rewards, he added.
The number of films in development on the lot has increased from 60 to over 450 while the number of pictures being released by the studio has grown to 23 this year from 14 last year.
Fox also hopes to increase its share of the top 10 all time best selling live action videos from five to six with the video release on December 3 of its new blockbuster, Independence Day, which has grossed US$600 million in box office sales this year.
""Fox Home Entertainment is off to a very strong start on the road to the future,"" Yapp said. ""Our projected revenues will increase 30 percent in 1997 and contribution will increase by 43 percent. The goal has been established our objectives have been set and the path to the future has been charted.""",0
"Indonesia's nascent funds industry will remain dormant until the government steps in and provides a boost, experts attending a mutual fund conference said on Monday.
""There needs to be somebody giving them a push. The push can come not just from banks, not just from private institutions, but from the government,"" said Venkatagiri Mudeliar, deputy general manager of Dresdner Thornton Asset Management in Singapore.
Despite its obvious promise, Indonesia's mutual funds industry faces substantial obstacles, including unbeatable returns from bank deposits offering up to 17 percent per annum.
One speaker said that more than 60 percent of pension fund assets valued at US$2.4 billion were held in bank deposits. Seven newly-established mutual funds with assets of about US$642 million were similarly invested.
Among recommended measures at the conference were tax benefits for mutual fund investors, permission to allow domestic savings to flow offshore and a major educational drive.
Felia Salim, director of the Jakarta Stock Exchange, told the conference that government discussions to provide a tax break to mutual fund investors were underway, and more than 40 percent of the bourse's budget for 1997 was dedicated to educating the public about the benefits of mutual fund investment.
But delegates said with international investment prohibited and foreign investment restrictions of 49 percent, incentives to setting up investment management subsidiaries in Indonesia were limited despite the industry's promise.
""Internationally, it's always a nervous position for a foreign fund manager to be in when it appears investment is a one-way street,"" said Paul Smith, managing director at the Bank of Bermuda in Hong Kong.
Foreign fund managers would be more likely to establish fund management subsidiaries in Indonesia if there were opportunities to manage Indonesian money offshore, he said.
""It's a hard call to make for a foreign fund manager to come down here and set up shop just to manage Indonesian domestic mutual fund business, which at the moment is a very small pie,"" Smith said.
Mudeliar said Indonesia is clearly committed to speeding up the establishment of its financial infrastructure, and catching up with its more developed Southeast Asian neighbours.
""Yes, they have lost out for a number of years but as you know nowadays knowledge is so freely available that they don't have to wait a full 15 years or 20 years,"" Mudeliar said.
""(They can make a) quantum leap in another five years. They can buy expertise, they can buy information ... I think Indonesia will be something to reckon with in the next 10 years.""",0
"Ambitious plans to establish Islamic mutual funds in Indonesia include the ""cleansing"" of profits disallowed under Islamic law, a senior fund manager told a mutual funds conference on Tuesday.
Islamic law prohibits Moslems from earning interest on bank deposits or investing in certain types of equities.
But Nik Ezar Nik Bolia, chief executive officer of Malaysia's DCB-RHB Unit Trust Management Berhad, said the company had come up with a tried and tested method of working around the rules.
""The cleansing process takes out the impact of the interest earned,"" he said. ""It's against Islam to gain interest on a deposit, so we remove and give to charity a proportion of the total profit.""
DCB-RHB's efforts have lured US$80 million into a domestic Islamic fund in Malaysia, where 54 percent of the population is Moslem, he said.
More than 85 percent of Indonesia's population of nearly 200 million is Moslem, suggesting an equally promising future awaits any fund that appeals to the nation's religious principles.
""Southeast Asia has a combined population of 220 million Moslems,"" Nik said. ""Therefore any product based on Islamic principles will be highly successful.""
To allay concern about stock market investments, Malaysia's Bank of Islam has set up panels of scholars to vet individual stocks to ensure they are ""halal"", or comply with Sharia law by avoiding liquor, gambling, pornography or footwear, Nik said.
""Then we look at the core business,"" he said. ""If it is halal that is fine, but if a subisidiary is not halal, the parent company will be rejected. However, if the subsidiary is halal and the parent company not, the subsidiary is halal and will be accepted.""
The same system will be set up in Indonesia by DCB-RHB's subisidiary, P.T. Rashid Hussain Asset Management, Nik said.
However, there are substantial obstacles blocking the path to Moslem mutual fund investment in Indonesia. Among the most obvious is a relatively casual approach to religion.
""In Malaysia, the law is enforced. If you are not fasting the police can come and catch you, but in Indonesia, religion is encouraged but if you don't do it no one really cares,"" said one delegate to the conference.
Nik countered that 40 percent of Indonesia's Moslems are observant, but conceded that a 1,000-person survey disclosed that most were already investing in prohibited bank deposits.
""Earning interest on bank deposits is a no-no under Sharia law and 61 percent said they knew that, but there is no alternative investment,"" Nik said.
He admitted that persuading these investors to switch into lower-yielding stock market funds subject to profit-cleansing presented a formidable challenge. But he said that savings put towards the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca offered hope.
""That will be the trick that we have to perform...but every year Indonesia has a high proportion of people going to Mecca,"" he said.
""This is my target market. If one of them were to save from ground zero to seven million rupiah into our fund before they redeem to go to Mecca, it is a captive market.""
Each year 195,000 Indonesian Moslems pay 7.55 million rupiah to participate in the government-organised pilgramage to Mecca.
(US$1 = 2,327 rupiah)",0
"The recent Asian tour by U.S. fund managers representing $234 billion in assets, including the hefty California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), has whetted Hong Kong fund managers' appetites.
""CalPERS has this innate ability of raising everybody's blood pressure because they've got so much money to invest. Get one percent and you double your assets under management,"" said Stewart Aldcroft, sales director for Templeton.
But it appears Hong Kong fund managers might be waiting in vain for a slice of the CalPERS pie.
While expressing a desire to raise their Asian and international weightings, the United States pension funds clearly stated a preference for direct investment over listed equity.
""The amount of transparency that we would expect with the companies is not available at this point,"" CalPERS board president William Crist said of Chinese public companies.
His statement highlighted a significant problem for U.S. money managers seeking increased exposure to Asia.
Foreign access to Asian markets is usually restricted, partly because many countries fear the sort of economic disruption that widened current account deficits after the last wall of foreign money came marching into the region in 1993.
Hong Kong fund managers, pointing to research indicating superior Asian performance by funds managed from within the region rather than from outside, said one option that could meet everybody's needs is private equity funds.
The performance of these funds is private but believed to far exceed that of public mutual funds.
Marcus Thompson, deputy managing director of HSBC Private Equity Management, said his funds hold $560 million, virtually all of it contributed by U.S. pension funds and invested in small companies expected to list within 10 years.
""Over the long term you're likely to get a superior investment performance,"" Thompson said. ""There's a discount for not being able to trade the stock.""
Cesar Zalamea, managing director of AIG Investment Corp (Asia) Ltd, declined to reveal the performance of his funds except to describe it as ""tremendous"".
AIG is the biggest private equity group active in Asia, with $2.38 billion under management -- nearly all of it rumoured to be contributed by one or two very big U.S. pension clients.
Zalamea said AIG's policy is always to hire Western-educated nationals who know the culture and the players in the indigenous business community. Established in Shanghai in 1919, AIG also has long-term relationships with many Asian corporations.
""When these (Asian corporations) decide they want to expand and invite investors outside family and close friends, we are naturals to be invited because (they) already know us,"" Zalamea said. ""CalPERS wouldn't have the kind of relationship.""
But there are disadvantages to private equity funds, the most obvious being their closed-end and long-term nature.
""One of the key issues about investment is to have your money back when you're ready to have it back, not when those in whom you are investing want you to have it back,"" said Aldcroft, who candidly admits Templeton wants to manage CalPERS money.
Another fund manager warned that while many venture capital funds do very well, others do not.
""The risk is higher. You don't have an out. The trick is in knowing how to say no,"" he said. ""If you haven't picked the right companies, how do you get out?""",0
"Hong Kong business groups on Thursday lauded Deng Xiaoping as a great leader but said the short-term impact of his passing would be limited.
""He was a great man. We are naturally saddened from a human point of view. But as regards business, I have to say it's business as usual,"" said Brigadier Christopher Hammerbeck, executive director of the British Chamber of Commerce.
The paramount leader won high praise from businessmen in Hong Kong for his economic reforms and for developing the ""one country, two systems"" policy which will prevail when sovereignty of Hong Kong reverts to China at midnight on June 30 under the terms of a 1984 Sino-British treaty.
""He was a great man of vision,"" said Ian Christie, director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
""The 'one country, two systems' approach to the transfer of sovereignty, at that time, in 1984, showed incredible foresight and courage.""
Given his contribution, it would have been better for all concerned if Deng had been able to witness the Hong Kong handover of July 1, said Mark Michelson, past chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.
""He made it a lot easier for the transition to take place,"" Michelson said. ""At the same time, there has been a leadership succession in place for some time now associated with the transition. So...the practical impact will not be overwhelming.""
The collective leadership now in place, led by President Jiang Zemin, has also been associated with the Hong Kong handover, Michelson said.
""So in the short-term there should be no impact, but in China one can never be sure,"" he said.
Most business groups declined to speculate on the longer term implications of Deng's death.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper fretted over a possible power struggle emerging in Beijing.
""Although Deng's death is unlikely to result in a major immediate policy shift over Hong Kong, changes in the corridors of power in Beijing will spill over into the territory,"" the Post said.
Hong Kong's government-funded Trade Development Council said Deng will not be forgotten for his contribution to the territory's ascent up the world trade league tables.
""If one were to take a look in 1979, the year China began economic reform, at that time Hong Kong was number 23 in the world league of trading entities. Today we are number eight,"" said executive director Michael Sze.
Deng is credited with the open door reforms which transformed China from an isolated economic backwater to emerging powerhouse.
""That just shows the tremendous progress we have made during the intervening years.""
Hong Kong trade, now valued in excess of US$350 billion ($44.9 billion), is heavily dependent upon southern China where Hong Kong manufacturers own and operate 50,000 factories employing five million workers.
The gradual shift of Hong Kong's manufacturing base into the cheaper labour regions of southern China transformed the territory into a service-based economy geared to China's economic emergence.",0
"Regulations issued by Indonesia earlier this year promoting the creation of mutual funds have become a landmark for the local industry, delegates to a conference said on Wednesday.
""The recognition of open-end funds or mutual funds by the Capital Market Law has been quite instrumental in the development of the Indonesian investment fund industry over the past few months,"" said Melli Darsa of the law firm Hadiputranto, Hadinoto and Partners in Jakarta.
Darsa was one of several fund experts attending a mutual fund conference in Jakarta who predicted a bright future for the domestic industry, with seven open-end mutual funds already established and five more in the pipeline.
Indonesia released regulations in May outlining accounting methods, reporting procedures and valuation methods for open-end mutual funds, which were allowed for the first time by the country's 1995 Capital Market Law.
The new legal framework gives Indonesia an edge, placing it half-way between the high risk and reward markets in China and India and the most exciting developed countries, most of which have hostile tax regimes, said Anthony Travers of the Hong Kong law firm Maples and Calder.
""In many respects, Indonesia is a halfway house,"" Travers told the conference. ""Indonesia has a much more developed (financial) infrastructure than China and India.""
But delegates saw significant obstacles ahead, including an almost complete ignorance of mutual funds among Indonesians, high-yielding bank deposits that lure domestic savings away from Jakarta's illiquid stock market, and restrictions on foreign investment.
Although Indonesian pension funds hold nearly US$2.4 billion they are prohibited from investing overseas, prompting some foreign fund managers to question the benefits of establishing Indonesian subsidiaries that will be restricted to managing domestic funds onshore.
But government officials made it clear that the purpose of the new rules was to persuade Indonesians to invest at home to spur development of domestic capital markets.
""We want to enhance domestic self-sufficiency. That is why you can only invest in Indonesian securities or new offerings,"" said Iwan Pontjowinoto, president director of P.T. Danareksa Fund Management, a state-controlled finance company that launched the first of the new open funds.
""We want to have local funds that can help the government by investing in the stock market,"" he said.
The new funds can only invest in domestic securities and are prohibited from selling more than one percent of their shares or units to any one investor, ensuring a wide investor base.
The new rules also ensure the funds are broadly invested, prohibiting them from spending more than 10 percent of their net asset value on any one company or buying securities representing more than five percent of the issuer's paid-up capital.
The conference, which attracted about 40 delegates from fund management companies, law firms, rating agencies and fund custodians around Asia, ended on Wednesday with a workshop on how to structure and price mutual funds.",0
"Economic commentators in Hong Kong are sounding alarms about the unbridled optimism spurring stock and property prices to new highs ahead of the British colony's return to Chinese sovereignty on July 1.
Concerns are mounting that rising price pressures could inflate a collapsible bubble on the assumption that China will support Hong Kong's economy through the transition regardless of any political disruption.
""The term 'moral hazard' refers to the apparently growing belief in local markets that there is little dramatic down-side risk -- as opposed to short-term volatility -- because ultimately China will suppport Hong Kong markets,"" Ian Perkin, chief economist with the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a column in the South China Morning Post.
In contrast to earlier fears that political uncertainty could torpedo Hong Kong's economy in 1997, domestic confidence in China's determination to keep the economy stable through the transition is so high that an unexpected problem has arisen -- price instability.
Economists are starting to revise upward their inflation forecasts for 1997 in response to booming stock and luxury property prices.
""The outlook for 1997 is going to be less good than we thought,"" said Kevin Chan, economist at Salomon Brothers.
Salomon has raised its 1997 forecast for the territory's benchmark consumer price index to 7 percent from 6.6 percent late last year, and Chan said further increases are possible.
Sudden strength in Hong Kong's stock market in the middle of last year was welcomed as proof of confidence in the colony's future under China, and evidence of an economic turnaround following an export slump early last year and three years of austerity in China.
But the optimism became concern in November when speculation emerged in the luxury end of Hong Kong's property market.
Citing anecdotal evidence, Perkin argued that overseas and domestic investors confident of China's commitment to economic stability in Hong Kong are rushing to buy high-end properties in anticipation of short-term gains.
The Hong Kong government has since strongly supported a set of anti-speculation measures by the Real Estate Developers Association, and warned it will step in if there are signs that speculation is filtering down to the middle or low end of the property market.
But economists said property price volatility would eventually stimulate overall inflation, even though it has been restricted so far to the high end of the market.
""This will not be good for inflation expectations,"" Chan said. ""In general, people will expect the higher prices in the luxury sector to affect medium and small flats.""
Chan estimates an overall rise of 30 percent in property prices will translate into at least a 15 percent increase in rents this year, which account for 25 percent of the Hong Kong government's benchmark consumer price index.
Food prices, which account for 37 percent of the index, are expected to rise by at least 8 percent this year after holding steady last year.
Hong Kong will also suffer from its currency link to the U.S. dollar. If the United States raises short-term interest rates this year by one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point, as many expect, real rates in Hong Kong -- the difference between nominal rates and inflation -- will fall to about 1 percent, Chan said.
Such low rates will propel growing momentum in both private consumption and retail sales.
China, with its well-documented aversion to the socially destabilising effects of inflation, has done little to stoke further exuberance over Hong Kong's post-1997 economy beyond saying it backed Hong Kong's currency link.
""There seems little doubt Hong Kong's new sovereign wants to see the local economy prosper throughout the year of transition and in the early years of its resumption of sovereignty,"" Perkin wrote. ""It (is) probably true that it does not want to see the local economy going on a speculative spree that will eventually run out of steam and cause a collapse.""",0
"Hong Kong conglomerate Wheelock & Co Ltd has launched a search for a new partner for its fledgling Hong Kong fund management company following NatWest Group's decision to pull out.
""We've got nobody on the hook but there are people with whom we're having discussions,"" said Nicholas Sibley, deputy chairman of Wheelock NatWest Ltd, a 50-50 joint venture between Wheelock and Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc.
Wheelock NatWest revealed last week that NatWest wants to dispose of its stake in the fund management division following its acquisition of British pension giant Gartmore Plc in February for 472 million stg.
""The decision to buy Gartmore meant the support and distribution and all of that that had been hoped for from NatWest in support of Wheelock NatWest Investment Management obviously weren't going to be available. They were going to use Gartmore as their fund management arm instead,"" Sibley said.
Sibley expressed disappointment at NatWest's decision, but rejected speculation that the remaining divisions under the joint venture -- corporate finance and equity stockbroking -- could also become vulnerable to NatWest pulling out.  
""Yes, obviously we're disappointed,"" he said. ""But there's no question of the equity and corporate finance business breaking up or anything like that. That is running along perfectly satisfactorily.""
The joint venture, which offers corporate finance and equity stockbroking services as well as investment management in Hong Kong, became fully operational one year ago.
Sibley said he understood why NatWest wanted Gartmore.
""They had a very weak fund management side themselves and they needed to make a sort of quantum jump in that activity, which is what the acquisition of Gartmore did for them.""
However, NatWest's decision to pull out comes at a particularly sensitive time for the new fund manager.
Wheelock NatWest Investment Management is experiencing rising commissions but the completion of its research division, considered essential to attract major institutional clients, has only just been completed, Sibley said.
""It takes a long time to build up a research product, which we only just got about a month ago,"" he said.  
""The commission figures go up and up and up every month. They haven't had a single down month since we started. But the big jump comes over the next six months when you can offer the full service to the major institutions and hope that we can attract them to deal with us through the quality of our research and execution service.""
Wheelock now hopes to find a European or North American partner, said Wheelock NatWest chief executive David Miller.
He said he hoped a decision would be made by Christmas.",0
"The largest electricity provider in the United States marched into Asia on Thursday with a US$2.7 billion deal to buy independent Hong Kong power producer, Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd.
Atlanta-based Southern Co said it made a general offer to all CEPA's shareholders after agreeing to buy most of a 60.4-percent stake held by CEPA parent, Hopewell Holdings Ltd.  
""The plan is to use this company as our growth vehicle in Asia,"" Ray Harris, regional director of Southern Electric International Inc, a unit of the Southern Co, told a news conference in the British colony.
""We think we paid a fair price and we see it as completing our geographical diversification from the United States,"" he said.
Hopewell said Southern aims to acquire 80 percent of CEPA's shares through a straightforward cash deal of HK$18.50 per share, or a cash and stock offer, he said.  
Hopewell has already agreed to tender 80 percent of its stake under an alternative cash and stock option, which offers one new CEPA share, cash of HK$69.50 and a contingency payment of HK$8.00 for every five CEPA shares.
The contingency payment depends on the company managing to secure a limited recourse debt for a power plant in Indonesia.
Hopewell will retain between 12.1 percent and 20 percent of the new company depending on which option shareholders choose.  
Southern's planned acquisition of 80 percent of CEPA's shares will effectively privatise the company, reducing its public float below Hong Kong stock exchange requirements and requiring it to de-list.
Shareholders, banks and regulators must still approve the deal, with shareholder meetings slated for November. Closing is expected before the end of the year.
Both Southern and CEPA said the takeover complements each other's strengths, with Southern renowned for its operating ability and CEPA one of the first to exploit Asia's quickening thirst for power.  
""This is, we felt, a very, very good marriage,"" said Stewart Elliott, CEPA's chief executive officer and managing director. ""If we're going to see Asian growth as everyone has predicted, a massive amount of power is required.""
Founded in 1993 as a holding company for Hopewell's power assets, CEPA owns some of southern China's largest power plants.
Its flagship Shajiao B project in Guangdong province was completed in 1987 at a cost of US$4.1 billion followed by the 1994 start-up of the US$1.87 billion Shajiao C power station.  
CEPA also owns substantial assets in the Philippines, and said it is negotiating to build more generating plants in southern China, the Philippines, Indonesia, India and Pakistan.
Harris said Southern was committed to pursuing all CEPA's existing plans, which he hopes will be augmented by Southern's expertise and financial muscle.
""We are very optimistic about the future... We would hope we would have some announcements in relation to new power plants (in the next six to 12 months),"" Harris said.
Elliott and Gordon Wu, CEPA's executive chairman and the founder of Hopewell, will remain in place, he said.",0
"An uneventful week of sideways trade is expected on most Asian markets following news that China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping had died on Wednesday.
Although many of the smaller Asian markets virtually ignored the news, Hong Kong and Taiwan surprised some investors by trading higher.
A strong week in Tokyo is not expected to last and regional traders said quality buying had yet to surface in Bangkok, this week's surprise performer.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand index has gained seven percent in the past eight trading days, recovering from the previous week's sharp slide on news of a debt rating review by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
Most of the other small Asian markets expect a week of sideways trade, although some could suffer from trader reports of fund flows out of Asia into Latin America.
""They can't find anything in Asia to buy,"" said one head trader. ""In Singapore and Malaysia, the earnings growth isn't massive and elsewhere it's not great. (Investors) expect better value in Latin America.""

HONG KONG - Stocks are expected to refocus on fundamentals in the week ahead and could trade sideways for much of the time although hopes of healthy corporate earnings may provide a positive bias, analysts said.
The market had a rocky ride last week, quaking on concerns about the health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping before rallying after his death cleared the uncertainty.
The Hang Seng Index rose 331.59 points, or 2.53 percent, over the week to close at 13,444.85 on Friday. The rise included a 305.01-point surge on Thursday following Deng's death.

BANGKOK - The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index is expected to post further gains in the week ahead as foreign and local investors follow through on a strong two-day rally, analysts said.
But buying is likely to be short-term and selective ahead of a central bank release of balance of payments data due on Thursday.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index gained 4.8 percent from last Friday to 747.70 points on Thursday as speculative pressure on the currency eased.

"Investing in Asian telecommunications stocks is full of hazards as the region grapples with a general lack of sophistication and wide discrepancies in demand and regulation, analysts say.
Views differ greatly on the potential of individual stocks and countries, but analysts generally agree that telecom regulation is the most important determinant to future performance.
""Understanding the regulators is essential as regulatory issues were the main determinant of Asian telecom stock performance last year,"" Jardine Fleming said in a recent report.
Asian telecom bulls say the global information revolution, combined with the region's rapid economic growth, have swamped the capacities of state-run operators, forcing a confrontation between regulators determined to meet demand and monopolistic state enterprises anxious to maintain market share.
""Asian telecom regulators, usually under-empowered, have promoted liberalisation, often taking on strong political and economic forces,"" Jardine Fleming said.
So far, regulators have responded by issuing licences -- a politics-fraught move that usually diminishes the prospects of the primary telecoms firm.
This is acceptable in low-penetration countries with untapped demand, analysts say, but more dicey in high-penetration markets, such as Hong Kong and Singapore.
""This is why deregulation in Hong Kong did not really make sense on the fixed-line side if the new licensees could not access the lucrative IDD sector, which they can,"" Jardine Fleming said.
DEREGULATION DAMPENS OUTLOOK ON HK, SINGAPORE TELECOMS
Continuing deregulation in Hong Kong and Singapore, two places with a high dependence on IDD traffic, has prompted a negative outlook on Singapore Telecom and Hongkong Telecom, it said.
In low-penetration countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, regulators have issued concessions to build fixed lines, giving contractors the right to receive local revenues and perhaps a portion of those from domestic long distance.
Because the new local lines stimulate long-distance demand, this arrangement fails to attract the ire of primary telecoms which reap the benefit, analysts said.
This has worked well in Indonesia and the Philippines, where new local fixed lines are expected to boost earnings in both PT Telkom and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) rather than eroding their market position.
The situation is very different in the cellular sector, where major market players are complaining that too many licences have been issued as they lose market share to strong second-tier players which are aggressively undercutting tariffs.
Because of this primary/secondary interplay, Jardine Fleming said it has turned negative on Advanced Info Services Plc and neutral on Piltel. But it remained positive on Total Access Communications Plc.
Malaysia's Technology Resources Industries Bhd has been battered down too hard, the brokerage believes, and it has been upgraded to a buy.
BROKERAGE BULLISH ON INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES
Deutsche Morgan Grenfell (DMG) is similarly optimistic on the outlook for PT Telkom and PLDT, but it adopts a much less optimistic overall view of Asia's telecom sector.
""The Asia-Pacific telecommunications industry is undergoing a period of rapid transition from a relatively underdeveloped and protected industry to one which is becoming increasingly saturated and highly competitive,"" DMG said in a recent report.
An overall increase in competitive pressures is not being made any easier by governments' liberal approach to the issue of licences and the lack of any industry consolidation, DMG said.
""In an environment of increasing saturation and rising competitive pressures, EPS (earnings per share) will continue to come under pressure,"" DMG said. ""We believe that we are already witnessing signs of industry maturity.""
DMG estimates that less than 10 percent of the population in the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia can afford telecom services.
DMG is positive on Indonesia and South Korea, but for different reasons.
Indonesia's lower telephone density combined with a restrictive and non-competitive regulatory structure are attractive, it said. In South Korea, a large middle class more than compensated for the higher number of phones.
""Although competitive pressures are rising, the combination of low, effective teledensity rates, a wide middle class and exceptionally aggressive capex and depreciation policy should ensure that Korea Mobile Telecom Co will continue to deliver above-average EPS growth rates,"" DMG said.
EVEN TOUGHER TASKS AHEAD FOR REGULATORS
Analysts said regulators have done the easy part -- issuing new licences. Now it gets tricky as new licensees demand better terms on geography, interconnection and IDD rights. Cellular licensees are also demanding more spectrum.
""What will be interesting to watch is how quickly these number two companies demand that they compete on fair terms with the primary telecoms,"" Jardine Fleming said.",0
"Pegged currencies are common in Asia, with its fondness for order and authoritarianism.
But to peg one's currency is always a drastic step with heavy consequences. While a fixed exchange rate might reassure foreign investors about currency stability, it can also prompt a slew of unruly side effects.
""What you ultimately sacrifice is your control over inflation,"" said Alan Butler-Henderson, regional strategist with ING Barings in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore and China all peg their currencies directly or indirectly to the U.S. dollar, requiring all them to mimic U.S. monetary policy to a greater or lesser extent regardless of domestic conditions.
Most of these economies bear no relation at all to the slow-growth, low-inflation United States. Instead, they are experiencing high growth and a rapid increase in domestic consumption at the same time -- an ideal recipe for inflation.
The lack of traditional inflation-fighting tools is a serious loss for countries anxious to avoid any erosion of often hard-earned economic progress.
SERIOUS PENALTIES
There are other, serious penalties, too.
A lucrative interest rate arbitrage can cause real problems for small Asian countries with fixed exchange rates. Best described as borrow low, lend high, the most common arbitrage tends to attract precisely the sort of capital inflows most small, Asian countries dread: so-called ""hot money.""
Large financial institutions with access to the best international lending rates deposit borrowed funds into Asian banks offering much higher yields and, because of the fixed exchange rate, avoid currency loss when they switch out.
Higher rates offer bigger returns, which attract even larger flows of hot money that swell money supply dramatically. Attempts by central banks to curb money supply by raising rates can have the reverse effect, luring in more hot, volatile money.
Both Thailand and Indonesia are familiar with this danger.
One economist noted that Indonesia has offered one of the best arbitrage opportunities in Asia for as long as it has depreciated its currency by between three and five percent annually, but the returns were particularly spectacular last year.
Speculators and hedge funds borrowed large sums in Japanese yen at about 0.75 percent annually and switched them into Indonesian bank accounts yielding 15 percent -- or more when riots swept through Jakarta in the summer.
""In terms of cost of funds, when you take the currency depreciation of the yen and the mild depreciation of the rupiah into account, you're paying nothing,"" the economist said.
The problem became so acute last year that Indonesia's central bank was forced to widen repeatedly the trading band for the rupiah, taking the market by surprise.
""The point of widening the fluctuation is to impart greater uncertainty so that it's not a freebie,"" said Sun Bae Kim, senior economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.
Indonesia also ordered its commercial banks to stop lending on occasion, even though soaring rates and strong loan demand offered excellent returns.
THE THAI EXPERIENCE
Thailand, which pegs its beleaguered baht to a basket of currencies including the U.S. dollar, tried to turn this arbitrage to its advantage by setting up the Bangkok International Banking Facility (BIBF) in 1993.
The plan, much admired by Asian experts, back-fired when Moody's Investors Service downgraded Thailand's short-term debt rating, drawing attention to its foreign liabilities.
The negative attention helped to fuel rampant speculation about a devaluation of the baht, forcing massive intervention by Thailand's central bank to keep the unit above a 6-1/2-year low.
Under the BIBF, a number of foreign and domestic banks were allowed to borrow foreign currency overseas, usually in U.S. dollars, and then lend the money in Thailand.
The scheme was a huge success. Foreign investors, already benefiting from competitive rates, also qualified for preferential tax treatment and rushed to invest in Thailand.
""Without those tax incentives and the access to cheap loans - U.S. dollars are by definition cheaper than Thailand (baht) - those companies would not be attracted to Thailand,"" said Clive McDonnell, chief economist at Crosby Group.
BIBF flows were used primarily for long-term investment, but international accounting rules required that they be classifed as short-term. This generated a sudden explosion in Thailand's short-term external debt to 63.3 percent of private sector debt in 1995 compared with 20.5 percent in 1993 -- a situation that quickly came to Moody's attention.
Asian economists defended the scheme while acknowledging its risks. Salomon Brothers noted that Thailand's foreign exchange reserves of US$38 billion far exceed outstanding short-term loans of US$16.1 billion.
And Moody's rival, Standard and Poor's, pointed out that many BIBF loans are backed by foreign banks rather than domestic financial institutions.
""Foreign BIBFs are probably less vulnerable to shifts in investor confidence, because their parent banks are more likely to stand behind them should unaffiliated lenders withdraw their credit lines,"" Standard & Poor's said. ""Moreover, obligations of foreign-owned BIBFs are not a contingent liability of the Thai government, given their foreign ownership.""
There is no question that the BIBF helped to lift foreign liabilities in Thailand's banking sector, but the underlying causes of the banks' asset quality problems were more commonly blamed on a weak property sector, economic recession, political turmoil and a gaping current account deficit.
Recent attacks on the baht were precipitated by concern about how to finance the current account following projections of a fourth-quarter fiscal deficit.
But analysts said the foreign liability created by the BIBF will probably provide further motivation for the central bank to defend the currency. And a sustained defence will require action on those asset quality problems.
""This means shutting down insolvent institutions and building the capital base of viable ones. The longer the delay in formulating such a plan, the greater will be the baht's susceptibility to speculative attacks,"" Goldman Sachs said.",0
"Blink and you missed it.
The much anticipated correction in Hong Kong stocks on Thursday on news of the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping gave fund managers all of 10 minutes to do some much-anticipated bargain hunting.
""This was not my expectation,"" said Ambrose Chang, chief investment officer at Daiwa Capital Management in Hong Kong.
Traders and fund managers said a huge bout of short-covering was responsible for the quick recovery on Thursday.
""It was futures driven,"" said one fund manager. ""The hedge funds came in and covered their positions and there were a lot of angry fund managers in London being woken up in the middle of the night by their brokers.""
After dipping 92 points at the opening, the Hang Seng index surged 305.01 points or 2.33 percent to close at 13,411.33 while the February index future ended 405 points higher at 13,485.
""The futures tried to open lower but there was no follow-through selling. All of a sudden they (the hedge funds) knew they were in trouble,"" one head trader said.
Clearly, it was the foreign funds, not the local punters, who got caught out.
""This news was in the market the whole week with certain people,"" said the head trader at one local house. ""I knew there was a massive short position in the market and after the first minute of trading, I wasn't at all surprised by what happened.""
Now that the dust has settled, fund managers are offering routine explanations for their near-term forecasts for the Hang Seng, all of them variations on the theme of a range-trade between 13,000 and 13,800.
U.S. interest rates and upcoming corporate earnings are expected to dictate direction, but most market players are expecting consolidation at current levels.
There were few reports of so-called ""top-slicing,"" or rotation of funds into other markets, although traders did report profit-taking in Singapore and Indonesia, both of which fell over the course of the week after recent strength.
Some funds said they had began cutting heavily overweight positions in Hong Kong when the Hang Seng hit 14,000 on January 16 and any further rotation is not justified given this week's strength.
Last week's action also proved the independence of Asian stocks, which were either unchanged or weaker on domestic factors when the Deng news hit.
""They're all completely sucked into their own things,"" one trader said.
Although individual factors helped push many indices lower through the region last week, traders and funds confirmed reports that institutional money was moving out of Asia and into Latin America.
""They can't find anything in Asia to buy,"" said one head trader. ""In Singapore and Malaysia, the earnings growth isn't massive and elsewhere it's not great. (Investors) expect better value in Latin America.""
One foreign fund manager said the flows were understandable given that Latin America is trading at about 12 percent earnings growth on a multiple of 11.5 times - 20 percent below the average Asian earnings multiple.
""And Southeast Asia is still going through this adjustment,"" he said.
""Global asset allocators still look at Asia as a region suffering from cost overruns, squeezed margins and, in some industries, a lack of pricing power.""",0
"Hong Kong business groups hit back on Wednesday at U.S. attempts to link China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading perks with how Beijing handles Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control later this year.
U.S. Congressman Jim Kolbe, leading a 22-member delegation from the House of Representatives to Beijing, said on Tuesday the United States will probably want to monitor Hong Kong for at least a year before granting China permanent MFN status.
""If MFN were conditioned or taken away, especially during the transition period, it would clearly have a devastating effect and make it much more likely that all the things we want for Hong Kong would not be achieved,"" said Mark Michelson, former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce.
China currently enjoys MFN, subject to annual review.
Hong Kong commentators noted that permanent MFN, which would allow China the same tariff treatment as other big U.S. trading partners without an annual review, was unlikely in 1997, the year that China takes back Hong Kong from Britain.
""It's unfortunate. Were it not for this being the year of the return of Hong Kong to China, I think it would have been an opportune time for the U.S. Congress to finally extend permanent MFN status,"" said Frank Martin, the American chamber president.
""But it is going to be difficult this year. Many members of Congress are very likely to want to take a wait-and-see attitude.""
Legislation on permanent MFN has been submitted to Congress but has not been voted on.
China, which argues full MFN status is essential for healthy Sino-U.S. relations, granted Kolbe's congressional delegation an interview with President Jiang Zemin on Tuesday.
Political analysts said Kolbe was committed to achieving permanent MFN status for China, but had tried to remind Beijing the United States wants to see a smooth handover in Hong Kong, where many are worried that China might impose repressive rule.
""Would a vote to tie MFN to the transition be a good idea? No,"" said one analyst, who declined to be identified.
""But to kind of use it one last time to signal concern while everyone knows annual MFN is going to go through doesn't hurt.""
As the leading entrepot for China-U.S. trade, the Hong Kong government has always backed China's application for MFN status. But on Wednesday it declined to comment on Kolbe's remarks.
China's annual application for MFN status goes to Congress in May. It has won approval every year since 1990.
However, former U.S. president George Bush was occasionally forced to use his presidential veto to eliminate various conditions that Congress attempted to attach.
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who accused Bush of coddling tyrants in the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign debates, de-linked the annual review of MFN from China's human rights record in 1995.",0
"An uproar over the sudden departure of Hong Kong's chief immigration official last July is expected to gather momentum this week, when the territory's top civil servant appears before a Legislative Council enquiry.
Anson Chan, the territory's popular chief secretary, is expected to resist demands by Legislative Council (Legco) committee members that she release confidential reports on former immigration boss Laurence Leung.
Chan's appearance before the committee on Wednesday sets the stage for a showdown between the Hong Kong government, now facing accusations of a political cover-up, and the Legco select committee investigating the Leung affair.
Committee chairman Ip Kwok-him last week threatened to use a powerful ordinance to slap Chan with contempt if she fails to unveil the reports -- statements which drew a sharp response from the government on Sunday.
If the committee uses the Legco (Powers and Privileges) ordinance to open the reports, ""then it will have to be solved in the court"", civil service secretary Lam Woon-kwong told the South China Morning Post newspaper.
At issue are two investigations, one an anti-corruption probe and the other a police integrity check, both performed before Leung left his post where he enjoyed access to highly sensitive information.
British press reports have since alleged that Leung was spying for China, which takes back Hong Kong after 150 years of colonial rule on July 1 this year.
Leung, whose daughter was murdered with a cross-bow in Canada four years ago, has denied being a spy. But a few days ago, Leung contradicted earlier claims that he resigned for personal reasons and announced that he was forced to quit.
The Hong Kong government said on Saturday that no decision had yet been made on whether to release the reports but stressed its concern to uphold the privacy rights of civil servants.
It also noted that witnesses before the select committee enjoy all the rights and privileges of a witness in court.
""If that witness claims public interest immunity in relation to any document, he is entitled to put his reasons before the chairman for a ruling,"" the government said in a statement.
Governor Chris Patten on Sunday reiterated his support for Chan and civil service secretary Lam Woon-Kwong, but declined to comment on how the government would respond to the committee's demands next week.
""Everything that's been done by the Secretary for the Civil Service and others has been with my complete support and endorsement,"" Patten said.
Political commentators said the Leung case had highlighted Legco's power to hold the Hong Kong government accountable.
In so doing, it has drawn attention to the sensitive issue of the future relationship between the executive and legislative branches of government in Hong Kong, and created something of a dilemma for Beijing, which has long argued that Legco became too powerful under Patten.
""The irony is that Beijing might find it extremely difficult to discredit Legco for doing the wrong thing now that the Government is being challenged on all fronts,"" political columnist Chris Yeung wrote in the South China Morning Post.
""But if it gives legislators a pat on the back, it would find itself giving credit to a body which it has decided to scrap on July 1.""",0
"Zero tax and limited regulation are luring billions of dollars into offshore mutual funds, spurring a growth industry in famed tax-free locations such as the Cayman Islands, according to a mutual fund legal expert.
""I think every indication is that the offshore part of the mutual fund industry will grow. In the offshore jurisdiction you have no taxation and a more appropriate level of regulation as a rule of thumb,"" said Anthony Travers, senior partner at Maples and Calder in Hong Kong.
Anecdotal evidence suggests these advantages have drawn nearly US$900 billion into offshore mutual funds so far out of an entire industry sometimes valued at US$5 trillion, he said.
A lack of professional infrastructure is often a compelling disincentive to authorising funds in countries offering the greatest returns, while high taxation levels deter mutual funds from setting up in promising developed markets, he said on Friday.
The alternative is to authorise the fund in an offshore region, avoiding tax while reaching into some of the world's most rewarding investment regions.
There are, however, drawbacks.
""If you go offshore and you invest into the onshore jurisdiction from your mutual funds, you have things like withholding tax and tax treatments that may be imposed on your profits, and marketing is very much an issue,"" Travers said.
Certain double tax treaty networks can allow investors to avoid some onshore tax requirements, but these treaties vary from country to country, as do marketing restrictions, he said. For example, offshore mutual funds are prevented from marketing to more than 100 investors in the United States, while the United Kingdom prohibits marketing of offshore retail mutual funds unless they are based in designated jurisdictions, such as Bermuda, Jersey and Guernsey.
It is possible to market a Cayman Islands-registered mutual fund in the United Kingdom, but only as a private placement and not as a retail fund, Travers said.
Despite their obvious benefits, Travers warned that investing in offshore mutual funds is not for everyone.
The lack of regulation gives greater flexibility in the establishment and administration of mutual funds but it also provides little recourse for unsophisticated retail investors, which partly explains why these funds cannot be marketed freely in the United States or the United Kingdom.
""You are essentially talking about mutual funds which are established by institutions for other institutions or very high net worth and sophisticated individuals, in which case it is felt additional layers of regulation are not appropriate or necessary,"" he said.
It is possible to market offshore retail funds in Europe, but funds must meet the requirements of the ""Undertakings of Collective Investment and Transfer of Securities"" (UCITS) directive, which ensures certain standards are met.
""They are supposed to be able to sell UCITS cross-border in Europe but in fact the European Union is still something of a myth when it comes to cross-border marketing,"" Travers said.
""And you find in these jurisdictions commensurately higher fees. Three to six basis points on net asset value is the price you pay to market to the retail sector,"" he said.",0
"China's B shares continued their sensational surge on Tuesday with Shanghai's index gaining 11.63 percent and Shenzhen 4.7 percent as foreign and Chinese investors poured funds into the markets.
Trading volume on the Shanghai B share market hit a 15-month high of 63.595 with the index ending up 6.525 points or 11.63 percent at 62.639 points.
Brokers said market sentiment had been boosted by the recent strong performance of the Shenzhen B share market on expectations that Beijing plans measures to boost B share trading.
The Shenzhen B share index rose 7.42 points, or 4.70 percent, to end at 165.10.
The Shenzhen market has risen far further and faster than Shanghai in the past two weeks, but dealers said there were signs that the action was now moving north to Shanghai.

ING Barings said that as a result of the heavy volume of trading, the company had today activated both its seats on the Shanghai Stock Exchange for the first time ever.
""There were signs that overseas institutions are paying more attention to B shares,"" one broker said. ""The short-term market trend is bright.""
But a second broker said the sharp rises woiuld inevitably be followed by a tumble, possibly as early as Wednesday.

Given the obvious lack of measures by the authorities to revive the supposed ban, the markets appear to be gaining confidence that local investors will not face being forced out of the market, at least for now, analysts said.
""The bull run may extend into later this week with the inflow of fresh money continuing,"" one broker said.",0
"Shanghai's foreign currency B share market has been consistently hitting historic lows over the past two weeks, and there's little prospect of a recovery at least until the middle of next year, analysts said on Monday.
They said there was no sign of a bottom to the market, with the foreign investors for whom the market was created having largely sold up and left, leaving it to local investors.
The confidence of the foreign investors has been killed by an unending string of disappointing company results and by the failure of the authorities to add new, sizeable and well-run companies to the market as promised, the analysts said.
""Confidence is totally destroyed and even long-term investors have begun to liquidate their positions,"" said a Shanghai-based investment analyst with a Western brokerage. ""A recovery of confidence will not happen overnight.""
The B share index closed down 0.809 points or 1.77 percent to hit another record low close of 44.867 points on Monday. It has hit all-time lows on five separate days over the past two weeks.
""There is no hope for the market to recover at least until the middle of next year,"" said a B share broker. ""The most important factor is that company performance for 1996 full-year is unlikely to improve.""
The dismal state of the B share is in sharp contrast to the local A share market which continues to attract huge amounts of cash, setting two-year year highs on a regular basis.
It is also at variance with the general level of interest among foreign investors in participating in the Chinese economic boom that continues unabated, with national growth this year expected to hit at least nine percent.
""If they listed a good company on the B share market even at this point, people would be willing to buy it,"" said a stock analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai.
Many B share firms were formerly state-run enterprises and the leadership, methods and attitudes of many are little changed from the days when they were accountable to no one by the state planners in Beijing.
""Unstable performance and declining profits of some key firms listed on the B shares market have made foreigners more and more doubtful about the future of the B share market as a whole,"" said a second B share broker. ""There is no immediate support or bottom line that we can see.""
""Few people are willing to buy because there is a fear that the market will just keep falling,"" said a Chinese analyst with a major local brokerage.
""But the falls have become meaningless with the volumes so thin,"" he added. ""The market has no momentum to rise due to lack of positive news.""",0
"China has approved three foreign banks to do local currency business, the official Shanghai Star newspaper reported on Tuesday, but bankers said deals could not start until a thorny tax rate issue was solved.
The newspaper said the three banks are Citibank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation and that they would be granted licences to handle Chinese yuan business this month.
Up to now, foreign banks with branches in China have been restricted to doing foreign currency business only, with the Chinese banks retaining a monopoly on the huge local currency (yuan) loan and deposit market.
The Star said the banks will be allowed to handle yuan deposits, loans and other business, adding that the business would be opened to more foreign banks from early next year.
Bankers have said they expect the business licences to restrict them only to taking deposits from and making loans to foreign-funded firms for the foreseeable future.
The deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, Chen Yuan, said on Tuesday that China would grant licences for foreign banks to conduct local currency renminbi (yuan) business ""very soon"".
""We will very soon introduce foreign banks into the renminbi business in Shanghai,"" he told reporters after a Hong Kong Monetary Authority conference. ""We will announce that very soon. It is a matter of days not weeks,"" Chen said.
He declined to say how many licences would be granted.
An official with one of the three chosen banks, said they had not yet been given formal notification that their applications to do local currency business had been accepted.
""But the PBOC has let us know we have been chosen in a more informal way,"" he said, asking not to be identified.
The main problem is the differing rates at which the authorities tax the profits of banks in China. Foreign banks are taxed at 15 percent, Chinese commercial banks at 33 percent and the main state banks at 55 percent.
Bankers say there is still no agreement on how profits made by foreign banks doing local Chinese currency business would be taxed.
""That issue still rests with the State Council, it is beyond the control of the Shanghai city government, or even of the PBOC,"" said a foreign banker.
He said the authorities wanted to unify the tax rate between the various banks, but there were huge wrangles over what rate to choose.
""Until the tax rate issue is resolved, I doubt if the foreign banks will start any local currency business,"" said the banker. ""They will want clarification beforehand.""
The Star newspaper said the three banks chosen to begin local currency business all had registered branches in the Pudong Development Zone to the east of Shanghai's city centre.
Officials had long said that only banks with Pudong branches would be considered for the licences.",0

"China's securities authorities Tuesday ordered the takeover of a futures exchange in what analysts said was the beginning of a clean-up campaign that may leave China with only four or five large futures exchanges.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said the Changchun United Commodity Exchange would merge with the Beijing Commodity Exchange, according to the Beijing-based Financial Times.
The Changchun exchange, which was forced to suspend trading for six months from last October after the securities authorities accused it of irregularities, would become a trading floor of the Beijing exchange, the official newspaper said.
Analysts said the merger was the first of an expected series aimed at closing many of the smaller commodities exchanges around China that have been the focus of intense market speculation.
""This shows the determination of the authorities to restrict and clean up the futures industry and is a sign of more mergers to come,"" said an analyst with a metals trading company active in the futures markets.
China recently launched a sweeping crackdown on its futures markets and authorities last month issued two documents stressing the need to further clean up the industry.
Rumours have circulated for weeks on the futures markets that authorities would close most of the nation's 15 exisitng commodity exchanges, mainly through mergers that would allow only four or five of the largest and best-run to survive.
The Financial Times said Changchun was selected as the first to be merged among the 15 because of rampant trading irregularities on the exchange.
Analysts said there were currently too many exchanges trading similar futures contracts, particularly cereals and metals.
But they said the takeover process would be far from easy due to opposition from local governments and a range of technical difficuties. The exchanges provided significant tax income for local governments, said one analyst, who noted that differences in the contracts and rules of trading also presented many problems for combining various exchanges.",0
"The threat of a Sino-U.S. textiles trade war is having little impact on Chinese firms as it is unlikely to go beyond words and because the companies are performing poorly, company officials and brokers said on Wednesday.
Company officials said they had got used to the continual verbal duelling between Beijing and Washington with concrete measures being avoided at the last minute.
""With the interests of both sides at stake, the verbal warnings will finally be replaced by mutual concessions,"" said Li Shounan, head of the general manager's office in Shanghai Lianhua Fibre Co Ltd.
""The overall amount under threat is not large and when it comes to an individual company, the impact is even less. We do not expect much effect,"" said an official with Shanghai Sanmao Textile Co Ltd.
But a spokeswoman for Shanghai Jiafeng Co Ltd said its products were involved in the dispute.
""There will surely be some impact if a trade war breaks out though it is hard to immediately to assess to what extent,"" she said.
China's annual apparel and textile exports to the United States are estimated at around $4.2 billion. About 30 garment and textile companies are listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen.
In the most recent clash in Sino-American trade relations, Beijing said on Sunday it would temporarily ban imports of selected U.S. textiles, farm goods, fruits and alcoholic drinks from December 10 in retaliation for U.S. sanctions taken against Chinese textiles.
Washington announced in September that it would cut China's textile import quota for 1995 by $19 million in retaliation after accusing China of shipping through third countries to avoid quotas agreed upon in a bilateral textile accord.
""Textile companies have performed very poorly in the past two years due to a slump of the industry and we do not expect any major impact even with a trade war,"" said one broker with China Shandong Securities Co.
""But a handful of firms closely linked to Chinese-U.S. trade will possibly be affected,"" he added.
""Who cares?"" said a Shanghai-based investment analyst with a Hong Kong securities brokerage. ""They (the listed textile firms) have done so poorly that few investors are interested in them.""
Some Chinese officials have said they believe there is a political agenda behind the U.S. trade threats against China.
""The U.S. penalties were announced before the U.S. elections and we believe they were closely linked to (U.S. President Bill) Clinton's political needs,"" said one official.",0
"Shanghai's real estate market is showing signs of recovery thanks to growing numbers of individual home-buyers and policy support from the city government, analysts and officials said on Thursday.
Increasing numbers of people are buying their own homes in the city as a result of lower interest rates, a state-run house-buying fund and the inability of many state firms to provide homes for their employees, they said.
People from other parts of China are also showing a growing interest in buying apartments in Shanghai, partly due to new rules that allow home purchasers from elsewhere to obtain residency permits in the city.
In the first nine months of 1996, private citizens bought 1.21 million square metres of commercial housing in Shanghai, or 55 percent of the city's housing space sold in the period, the city's Business News said on Wednesday.
""Two years ago, all our buyers were enterprises,"" said a salesman from a Shanghai real estate company. ""But this year nearly half the houses we sold were bought by individuals.""
A key element in this growth is a public housing loan fund set up by the city government in 1992, into which most employers and employees each pay five percent of an employee's salary.
""More people have bought and plan to buy houses with the help of these funds due to lower interest rates on loans after two cuts in bank interest rates this year,"" said an official of the Construction Bank of China, which administers the fund.
""In the first half of this year, we lent about 500 million yuan ($60.24 million) from the fund and expect to lend 1.2 billion for the whole year,"" he said.
""Between 1992 and 1994, individuals borrowed a total of only 220 million yuan from the fund and in 1995 the figure reached 440 million yuan,"" he added.
To encourage more individuals to buy, the city government in September cut the tax on house purchases by half and in August raised the rents on state-owned apartments by 50 percent, a Shanghai Bureau of Real Estate Administration official said.
""These measures, including allowing non-Shanghai people the right to obtain a residence permit by buying property, show the determination of the local government to help real estate become a key industry in the city,"" she said.
In August, Shanghai started giving residency permits to out-of-city people if they bought an apartment worth more than 400,000 yuan in the Pudong New Area, and have since extended the offer to all districts of Shanghai.
Pudong is on the east side of the Huangpu River that runs through the city. Puxi, the main area of the city, is on the west side.
Pudong has so far sold 327 apartments worth 86.2 million yuan to people from outside of the city, an official of the Pudong Real Estate Exchange said.
""Sales of property in Puxi, despite higher prices, are hotter than in Pudong which is still seen as less convenient in terms of traffic,"" said an official of the Shanghai Real Estate Trading Centre said.
""Buyers from outside the city, mainly successful business people and enterprises, regard Shanghai as the best place in China to do business,"" he said.
Shanghai's economy continues to power ahead of the rest of China, with 12.8 percent growth in the first 10 months of 1996, official figures show.
China's GDP growth this year has been officially forecast at around 9.6-9.7 percent, compared to 10.5 percent last year.
Shanghai real estate prices have changed little in the first nine months of 1996 despite the increased sales due to a parallel growth in supply.
The average price of an apartment in Shanghai is now 4,020 yuan ($484.30) per square metre and office space 6,880 yuan ($828.90) per square metre, the Business News newspaper said.
""No one doubts that prices of property in the city will rise in the coming years,"" an analyst said.",0
"China's top securities watchdog on Monday issued new requirements for exchanges and securities houses to strengthen risk control with the aim of cooling its over-heated domestic A share markets.
But the markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen responded with fresh rises in active trading with the A share indices hitting new 1996 highs, and analysts said the warnings would have little impact on the current active trading.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), in a circular, ordered the two stock exchanges to investigate the risk control mechanisms of their members, the Shanghai Securities News reported.
All securities houses must now display in their business halls warnings about the risks of trading on the stock markets, the circular said.
""The exchanges must quickly organise several groups to investigate the risk control systems of their members and report the results to the CSRC,"" it said.
It also ordered designated newspapers and magazines to report more on the risks of stock investment.
""Any comments on stock markets must avoid encouraging speculation in order to prevent investors being misguided,"" it added.
The new instructions follow dramatic surges on the domestic A share markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen this year.
Beijing announced a new positive policy towards the stock markets in April, and since then Shanghai's A share market has risen more than 100 percent and its Shenzhen counterpart more than 250 percent.
By the end of November, China had 20 million retail investors in stocks, double the number at the end of 1995, according to media reports.
""The central government is concerned about surges on the markets which might be out of control,"" said Yuan Ji, an A share trader with China Guotai Securities. ""It hopes the markets will rise more steadily.""
The surges apparently have been beyond the expectations of the securities authorities and, to cool the over-heated markets, the CSRC has over the past few weeks issued a series of new rules and punished many brokerages for irregularities.
But, despite the fresh warnings, Shanghai's A share index hit a new 1996 high of 1,312.295 points in the morning session on Monday and its Shenzhen counterpart a high of 486.22.
""Investors believe the authorities do not want to depress the markets, but are just worried over prices rising too fast,"" said a trader with a major Chinese brokerage. ""Because of this belief, the new warnings will have only a slight impact.""
The CSRC in the circular also ordered local securities authorities to ensure the securities institutions have displayed the information by January.",0
"""Why can't I access the Playboy Website?""
That, say computer experts, is one of the most common complaints from the growing number of Internet users in China.
China, which controls information more carefully than most countries in the world, is cautiously opening up access to the Internet, in spite of the problems raised by such an anarchically free information dissemination medium.
Officials said security filters were placed on the main Internet access servers in Beijing and Shanghai in the middle of this year and, after a testing period, restrictions on ordinary people opening Internet accounts have been removed.
The filters stop access to politically sensitive sites on the Internet's World Wide Web supporting such causes as independence for Tibet or release of Chinese political prisoners.
They also attempt, often unsuccessfully, to stop access to the thousands of sexually-explicit sites such as Playboy magazine's Web page.
""Our customers using the Internet have complained they can't get through to the some sites, particulary sites like Playboy,"" said a computer industry expert working in Shanghai. ""You'd be surprised at how many customers we have calling about that.""
Meanwhile, usage of the Internet in China is growing so fast that phonelines on the main services are often engaged all day and far into the night.
""Growth is out-running infrastructure investment, so the system is being inundated,"" the computer expert said.
""Popularity is no problem, it's super-popular, but the government is not re-investing the money at a fast enough rate. So there's still a lot of technical problems. People are having trouble with access and speed once they get on,"" he added.
A senior official with Shanghai's Post and Telecommunications Bureau said there were no longer any restrictions on Chinese people signing up for Internet access.
""Some time ago, our security arrangements were incomplete and there was a problem with pornographic and politically unacceptable material,"" said the official, Zhang Weihua.
""But our arrangements have been improved and new accounts are being added without restriction,"" he added.
Zhang said there were a total of 3,200 registered Internet accounts on the Shanghai server at the end of August with the number increasing at several hundred a month.
But there are indications that several other organisations are selling Internet access and the real number of users is probably much higher, analysts said.
Chinese users going through the two main servers can access the World Wide Web and use e-mail, but the Internet's freewheeling discussion news groups are restricted.
And while users are able to establish their own Web sites, they are not supposed to load the material onto the Web themselves, said an attendant at one of Shanghai's two new Internet Cafes.
""You must give us the files to allow for inspection and we will upload them for you,"" the attendant said.
Analysts said the main priority of the authorities at present seemed to be to control the number of lines through which the worldwide Internet material enters China to just two -- one in Beijing and one in Shanghai.
""There's is upposedly another line going through from (the southern city of) Guangzhou to Hong Kong, but for political reasons, Beijing wants to keep very tight control,"" said the computer expert.
""I think Beijing and Shanghai will continue to be the main filtering points because otherwise they can't filter it. If they have a lot of international links then you can forget about any kind of filtering,"" he added.
The question, he said, is whether the Chinese authorities can stay ahead of the ever-changing technology of the Internet and ahead of the ability of local computer whiz-kids to find ways round any barriers that are set up.
""Given the number of hackers in China, I would say there's no way in hell (they can stay ahead),"" the expert said. ""This is a country full of hackers. These guys have found so many holes in the (Chinese) servers it's ridiculous.""
""The servers don't have the latest security equipment installed and these guys are brilliant. They can see all of our e-mails. I know there are people who have all our account names and passwords,"" he added.",0
"More foreign firms are finally beginning to realise the dream of the China market that has long tantalised traders -- selling goods to the world's largest slice of mankind and making money from it.
Many foreign companies remain stuck in China ventures that are loss-making and frustrating, but the number turning a profit or at least gaining solid market share is increasing, along with the market, according to analysts and businessmen.
In the 16 or so years since China opened its doors to the global economy, the country has become the second-biggest recipient of foreign investment funds in the world, after the United States.
Foreign brands such as Coca-Cola, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Lux soap have become household names throughout China, and the shelves of convenience stores from Harbin to Hainan are stuffed with foreign brand soaps, chocolates and cigarettes.
PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF
""Overall more and more companies are coming, which is not necessarily to say they're making money yet,"" said a Western diplomat in Shanghai. ""But there's now a general view that there's not only great potential but also an increasingly good track record for companies that have persisted.""
""You can now see that if you stick it out, you can make money and you can get good market share. Coca-Cola is now a household name thoughout China,"" he added.
Coca-Cola came back to China after a 30-year absence in 1979, and the company booked its first accounting profit for its China operations 11 years later, said John Farrell, head of China operations.
""You cannot afford not to be in China. It's just the reality of opening a country of this size and the size of the economy and population,"" Farrell said.
""But it takes a lot of patience and you need to be very diligent to build your business. It's not easy by any means.""
Coca-Cola has 18 bottling plants across China, and with sales volume doubling every three years this is just the beginning.
Coca-Cola declines to say just how profitable the China market is. Like most other companies, it does not issue figures on its China operations.
MARCHING WITH THE CONSTRAINTS
""You have to march along with the constraints that you're given,"" Farrell said.
""The main thing for us was living up to the commitments we'd made on building plants, transferring technology and training people. The more we did that, the longer we did that, the more people would believe and trust us and allow us to expand a little bit more.""
Among the sectors that have done well so far are communications equipment firms, such as Motorola and Ericsson, and low-priced consumer product makers.
""Generally speaking, the easiest place to make a profit tends to be in the consumer industry, usually fairly small-scale operations,"" said Anne Stevenson-Yang, director of China operations for the U.S.-China Business Council.
""That is, assuming the deal is done right,"" she added.
There are big variations on market access and ease of business for foreign companies depending on the sector they are trying to storm.
The restraints are few in areas such as consumer products, while in sectors such as banking, distribution and insurance, foreign firms are kept on a very tight leash.
BIGGER INVESTMENT EQUALS BIGGER RISK
Overall, companies involved in high-cost, long-term projects seem to bear a proportionately bigger risk, analysts said.
""Big heavy industry projects are a problem,"" said one foreign broker in Shanghai.
""Generally foreign businesses in trouble have a bad business plan, or they're doing things which China is not famous for -- like trying to build aeroplanes or something.""
The automobile industry has seen its share of troubles for foreign firms who have ventured in.
Chrysler Corp had a famously difficult relationship when it set up a joint venture in Beijing in the early 1980s, and France's PSA Peugeot Citroen is looking at closing one of its two China plants.
""We're having some difficulties -- all Western carmarkers are having difficulties in China,"" said a Peugeot official in early December.
General Motors, which has been close to completing negotiations for a $1 billion automobile factory in Shanghai for months, is well behind schedule on its plans and could have trouble ever making a profit in China, according to some analysts.
""It's going to be very difficult for them to make money. But they're coming in because they feel they have no choice,"" said the Western diplomat. ""It they don't do the deal, Ford will.""
Hong Kong and Taiwan businessman have generally done much better in their investments than non-Chinese, said a representative for a Hong Kong trading group in Shanghai.
""But more people make money than they would admit,"" he added. ""People find ways to shift profits to Hong Kong or from one company to another to make things look like break-even.""
CHOOSING MARKET SHARE OVER PROFITS
Making money is anyway not a top priority for many companies in the China market, at least in the initial stages. Many are happy to break even or lose money for many years in order to gain market share.
The Canadian insurance company Manulife, for instance, which set up a joint venture last month, said it doesn't expect to see a profit for at least seven years.
""Many companies are ploughing everything back into expansion and advertising,"" said a Western diplomat. ""In many cases, headquarters doesn't care if you make money, it's whether you're getting greater market share.""
""If you're a global company you have to be here, and the potential risk of not being here is greater than losing your shirt for a while when you come in,"" said Richard Graham, representative of ING Barings in Shanghai.
Success and failure for a foreign company in China is also closely related to who they work with.
""The reasons for people failing are usually related to joint venture problems. Choosing the wrong partner is the source of a lot of difficulties,"" the diplomat said.
But analysts said profits and market share aside, major advances have been made by foreign firms in recent years in the areas of experience and staffing.
""There are many companies now which have a lot of experience of operations in China, their staff are more used to operating in Chinese ways, and local staff are more used to operating under international practice,"" said Barings' Graham.
""This should allow them to go forward more positively.""",0
"China's foreign currency B shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen surged on Wednesday as investors piled in money on the back of rumours the government was planning measures to support the markets, brokers said.
Shanghai's B share index soared 5.49 percent to 49.689 points, while the Shenzhen index was up 8.25 percent to 111.35 in heavy trade.
""There have been widespread talk that regulators are meeting somewhere discussing ways to turn around the long bearishness of the Hong Kong dollar-denominated stock market,"" a broker at China Southern Securities in Shenzhen said.
""Such rumours triggered a steady inflow of fresh money,"" he added.
In Shanghai, brokers said the sharp rise was a reflection of the activity in the Shenzhen market with overseas investors buying selected stocks with relatively good prospects.
""B shares prices had become too cheap to drop any further, with the domestic economic situation improving,"" one broker said. ""And recent rises in Shenzhen B shares also provided a chance for Shanghai B shares to follow.""
In Shenzhen, brokers and analysts said the recent surges were linked to a report in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times last Thursday that the China Securities Regulatory Commission has been concerned about the market's prolonged bearishness.
The newspaper quoted the CSRC's chairman Zhou Daojiong as saying at an international business forum in Beijing that the poor performance of the country's B markets had negatively affected China's reform and open policy.
The buying is being led by Chinese domestic institutional investors, with increasing amounts of money from overseas investors, said brokers.
""There is also money coming from Chinese individual investors, but the amount is imposssible to calculate because it's illegal,"" said one analyst.
China's B shares are supposed to be for foreign investors only, but most of the trading is now done by domestic investors through a variety of means.
Stock analysts were at a loss to come up with suggestions as to what market-boosting measures may be implemented, assuming the rumours of an impending announcement from Beijing are correct.
""Beyond quietly allowing local Chinese investors to come back into the market, I can't think what they could do,"" said one analyst. ""The problem has always been that the companies listed on the B share market are not performing well enough.""
Another analyst said that the B share market will face a correction over the short term, given the fast pace of its ascent and that its medium-term trend should be decided by whether regulators announced stimulative policies.
""The rumours are responsible for the current rises but market fundamentals have changed little,"" said a Shanghai broker. ""The upward trend can only be established after concrete governmental measures are announced. Otherwise, it will shortly be reversed.""",0
"China on Monday named the first four foreign banks, based in Shanghai, to be allowed to conduct business in the local Chinese currency, ending months of speculation.
The four banks are the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp, Citibank, Tokyo-Mitsubishi Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan.
A spokesman for the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said the foreign banks would be allowed to do Chinese currency loans, deposits and some other business.
""The scope of the business was defined in the rules issued recently,"" he said but declined to give further details.
A report from the official Xinhua news agency two weeks ago said the chosen foreign banks would not be allowed to have oustanding local currency loans exceeding 35 percent of their foreign currency loans.
All foreign banks in China are currently restricted to do business in foreign currency and have been eager to gain a share of the huge local market for Chinese yuan deposits and loans.
Foreign banks doing China yuan business would have to adopt the regulations that applied to Chinese financial institutions, Xinhua said.
It did not elaborate, but that appeared to mean foreign banks would have to accept the same tax rate used for Chinese banks -- one of the key obstacles to implementing the policy change.
Foreign bank profits are currently taxed at a 15 percent rate while Chinese commercial banks are taxed at 33 percent and the main state banks at 55 percent.
A foreign banker working with one of the chosen banks said formal confirmation had been received today.
""But there were no details at all, no conditions of business given,"" he said.
A foreign banker with one of the other banks said he had not yet received formal notification.
""There has been no news,"" he said. ""But even after we hear, it will still be at least a month or two before business would start. My impression is it will take quite a while. There are many things to sort out.""
The tax rate issue remains unclear and is still the main obstacle to foreign banks starting up local currency business, he said.
The China manager of Credit Lyonnais, Jacques Bertholier, said he hoped his bank would be included within the second batch of banks to be granted approval to do yuan business, hopefully within a couple of months.
""It is not perfectly clear what the terms of business are, but there appears to be a good scope for activity,"" he said.",0
"Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said on Monday.
The share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.
Rumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.
While the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.
""The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.
""Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,"" he added.
Beijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.
""The action has cooled speculative activity for now,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.""
In the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called ""rubbish shares"" which have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.
""Retail investors have turned more to blue-chip shares,"" said a trader. ""Their prices have been stable despite the crackdown.""
Analysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.
One key problem of the Chinese share markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.
""With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,"" said one stock analyst.
The draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon partly due to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.
Responsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.
Shanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.
In Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.",0
"Shanghai city is on the verge of renting out the former Hongkong & Shanghai Bank building on the riverside Bund to an unnamed bank but definitely not the Hongkong Bank, a senior official said on Wednesday.
The official, Zhou Jinbao, said final negotiations were in progress with two or three contenders for the huge building, built in 1925 as a symbol of the financial might of the British Empire.
""I will invite you to the signing ceremony. It will be held very soon,"" Zhou, general manager of the Bund Buildings Transformation Corp, said in an interview. ""The basic issues have now been basically agreed upon.""
He declined to say which companies were in the final running but said he expected the winner to be a bank.
""It is not the Hongkong & Shanghai Bank,"" he added.
The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd, a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, had more than two years of discussions with Shanghai city officials on terms for resuming control of their former headquarters but finally announced that they had decided not to proceed with the proposal.
Zhou said the Hongkong Bank had wanted to demolish several buildings behind the main structure and erect a modern office tower.
But he said this proposal would have had an impact on wider development plans for the area which have not yet been fixed and are unlikely to be finalised for at least another year or two.
The main building has 24,000 square metres of space and Zhou said he was looking at around three U.S. dollars per square metre per day in rental. The lease can be for any period up to 30 or 40 years.
""The rental fee we are looking for is based on the fact the Bund should be the highest priced piece of land (in Shanghai). If other buildings are currently renting for two dollars a day (per square metre), then this building should be three dollars,"" he said.
At that price, the monthly rental fee for the building would be over $2 million per month. Renovation costs, he estimated, would cost around $15 million.
The building is steeped in history. After serving in effect as the East Asian financial headquarters of western imperialism for a quarter of century, it became after 1949 the Communist Party's Shanghai headquarters and city hall.
The city officials finally moved into a new building last year, leaving the old bank empty and echoing, waiting for a new tenant.
The main banking hall, with its magnificent marble pillars and curved glass roof, has had its banking counters removed and the murals which adorned the main domed entrance hall have been painted over.
The room just off the hall which served as the bank's general manager's office and later the office of a succession of Shanghai city Communist Party chiefs, is small and airless.
""This building has not only huge architectural value, but also great cultural and historical significance,"" said Zhou. ""That is why we will only rent it. We will not sell it. It is a treasure.""",0
"Last week's stern crackdown on China's stock markets has increased the speculative instinct of investors to trade on rumours of policy shifts rather than on fundamentals, analysts said Monday.
The share markets started their latest bull run in April when Beijing announced it would support the markets.
Rumours and guesses about Beijing's attitude and plans have been the primary trading factor ever since, the analysts said.
While the Beijing authorities have been trying to convince investors to look more at long-term investment based on the fundamentals of the economy and of individual companies, they again chose an old-fashioned means of reining in the markets.
""The crackdown has shown again the risk of policy changes for China's stock markets,"" said an executive with a major Chinese securities house.
""Policy changes have been a very hot speculative topic in the past and the use of administrative orders like this to cool down the markets will make them an even hotter topic in the long run,"" he added.
Beijing last Monday charged that China's two stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen were overheated and warned that Beijing would not come to investors' rescue if the markets crashed.
""The action has cooled speculative activity for now,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage in Shanghai. ""But the investment pattern has not changed. It is still political issues which drive the stock market up and down.""
In the shake-out last week, investors generally took refuge in blue-chip shares and dumped the so-called ""rubbish shares"" that have soared in recent months on the basis of little more than an impression that Beijing wanted the markets up.
Analysts said market psychology could have been better influenced if the authorities had pulled share prices back down using market means such as the issue of more shares or the listing of some state or institutional shares.
One key problem of the Chinese stock markets is the lack of suitable supervisory mechanisms and regulations, leading to widespread irregularities such as share price manipulation and the use of credit for stock trading, the analysts said.
""With a stock market law lacking and regulations incomplete, many trading activities are in a legal no-man's land, making it difficult to check irregularities,"" said one analyst.
The draft Securities Law, the topic of hot debate in the corridors of power in Beijing for years, is not expected to be enacted any time soon, due partly to differences over who will have the final say on securities policy, the analysts said.
Responsibility for securities policy at present overlaps between the Securities Commission under the State Council (cabinet), the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the People's Bank of China, or central bank.
Shanghai's domestic A share index rose 17.606 points or 1.91 percent on Monday to end at 939.946 after losing about 20 percent in last week's trading. The foreign currency B share index was up 0.944 points or 1.48 percent to 64.687.
In Shenzhen, the A share index fell 6.71 points or 2.04 percent to 322.25, while the B share index soared 6.11 percent or 7.68 points to 133.24.",0
"Chinese authorities have closed their eyes to the booming illegal trade by domestic investors in foreign currency B shares and will not interfere unless the market becomes too speculative, analysts said on Friday.
The B shares listed on China's two stock markets, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, were created to attract funds from foreign investors.
But in the past six months the vast majority of trading has been done by domestic investors who have opened trading accounts by various means in contravention of the rules.
""The authorities have just closed their eyes to the issue,"" said an analyst with a foreign securities firm in Shanghai. ""It looks like they will just leave it alone, as long as the markets don't become too speculative.""
Given the huge volatility of the B shares over the past two weeks, it would appear the threshold of the authorities on the issue is high.
Shenzhen's B shares have risen more than 50 percent since mid-November and Shanghai's B shares are up over 15 percent in the same period, but with huge falls on some days.
Brokers have attributed the rapid rises and falls largely to rumours that the Beijing authorities plan either to allow domestic investors to buy B shares or to reaffirm the ban.
""The Beijing ban is there, but Beijing knows it is unenforceable,"" said another brokerage analyst. ""And the brokers want local people to buy B shares because turnover would be so low without them.""
A broker in Shenzhen said many domestic securities firms had opened B share trading accounts in Hong Kong, while Chinese individuals encounter no problem in opening the accounts, particularly in Shenzhen, which is just across the border from the wealthy British colony.
B-share trading is supposed to be restricted to people with foreign passports or residents of Hong Kong and Taiwan, but the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges are interpreting the rules with great flexibility, analysts said.
""The Shanghai exchange handled it in an interesting way,"" said a broker in Shanghai.
""A couple of months ago they required all B-share trading account holders to re-register, but all that they required was that people present a passport or a copy of a passport that didn't even have to be theirs,"" he said.
Analysts have said the basic reason for the ban on domestic investors holding B shares is to prevent an outflow of foreign exchange as foreign investors sell their holdings to local people.
But the announcement on Thursday that the Chinese yuan would become fully convertible on the current account this Sunday was taken as a sign by traders that the day was approaching when the ban on B share trading by locals would be dropped.
The Shenzhen B-share index rose 5.35 percent to 142.71 points on Friday on the news, brokers said. Shanghai B shares closed up 1.14 percent to 53.421.
""It is pretty hard for the securities regulators to curb the inflow of money from mainland Chinese into the Shenzhen B market because Hong Kong dollars are so easily available here due to the proximity to Hong Kong,"" said one Shenzhen analyst.
""I believe more and more Chinese will put their hard currency into the market after mid-1997 when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule,"" he added.",0
"Trading on most of China's futures markets, under pressure from Beijing to curb speculation, has now dropped so far that hedging has become virtually impossible, traders and analysts said on Tuesday.
A trader with a futures firm in Shanghai said only the metals contracts market, the Shanghai Metal Exchange, still had enough liquidity and flexibility to allow companies to hedge risk.
Beijing has recently issued two key documents encouraging the securities markets but warning the futures markets of more clean-ups and restructuring to come.
Rumours have swirled around the futures markets in recent days that Beijing plans to merge or close many of the 15 futures exchanges in the country, possibly concentrating all futures trading into five exchanges.
""From what I hear about the feedback from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), there is no such plan,"" said Xie Boxing, deputy manager of the Information Department of the Shanghai Cereals and Oils Exchange (SCOE).
""There is no change to the basic policy of developing these markets,"" he added.
But Xie said liquidity on the exchange, particularly in rice, had fallen off as a result of the Beijing statements on the futures markets, making it difficult for companies to use the exchange for hedging.
""The scale of trading at this point is a bit small for hedging,"" he said.
The irony of the crackdown on the futures markets is that it has removed the basis for hedging and left only speculators in the market, one analyst said.
A second Chinese futures company trader said the trading volume of most commodity futures contracts on Chinese exchanges was now so small that there was no opportunity for hedging operations to take place.
""The only people trading the contracts for most of these commodities are speculators,"" the trader said.
A spokesman for the CSRC in Beijing on Monday told Reuters that the authorities still wanted the futures markets to develop despite the recent documents on the futures markets stressing current problems.
""This does not mean that futures market should cease to develop, development is a constant theme for China's futures market,"" he said.
But the spokesman declined to comment on the rumours of impending closures and mergers of futures exchanges.
""I cannot say anything on measures to deal with the markets in the future, I don't know whether some futures exchanges would be closed,"" he added.
One trader said that while the authorities would probably not formally close any of the exchanges, they could take other measures to in effect slowly strangle them such as raising the margin requirements on various contracts.
SCOE's Xie said the authorities still viewed the futures exchanges, set up in the early 1990s, as an experiment, but he felt that in the end they would prove their value.
""There should be a bright future for futures, particularly for contracts for agricultural products. That's how the futures business began in other parts of the world, and China is a big agricultural producer,"" he said.
But for now, trading volumes are down significantly on the SCOE compared to last year.
Up to Monday, 6.40 million lots on all contracts changed hands on the exchange this year compared to a full-year total of 13.5 million lots last year, he said. One lot is five tonnes of commodities.",0
"Too many futures exchanges in China are presently trading metals contracts, which should realistically be limited to just one or two given the current low trading volumes, officials and analysts said on Thursday.
Five of China's 14 futures exchanges have metals contracts but only two of them, the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, see substantial trading, mostly in copper, a local broker said.
The other three exchanges which have at least some trading in metals futures contracts are the Chongqing exchange in southwestern Sichuan province, the Shenyang exchange in the northeast and Tianjin.
""Five exchanges doing metals are too many, I think one or two would be enough,"" Gu Jianxing, manager of information department of the Shanghai Metal Exchange, said in an interview.
""There have been rumours about mergers, but we have heard nothing official,"" he added.
China's securities authorities, while encouraging the stock and bond markets, have been cracking down mercilessly on the futures markets in recent months due to massive over-speculation on some contracts.
The futures exchange in the northeast city of Changchun last month became the latest casualty, being forced to merge with the Beijing futures exchange.
The Shanghai Metal Exchange's Gu said the pressure from Beijing to stamp out speculative activity had had a dramatic impact on trading volumes on the exchange.
""The restrictions have had a negative impact on market sentiment with turnover dropping,"" Gu said. ""State-owned firms have been banned from speculating and financial institutions have been pushed out of the futures markets.""
Gu said he expected trading volume on the Shanghai exchange this year to be only about 300 billion yuan ($36.14 billion), compared with 455.8 billion yuan in 1995 and a record 682 billion yuan in 1994.
""In a way, the metals trading has already been focused on one or two exchanges given the low trading volumes seen in the other three exchanges,"" said an analyst with a Shanghai futures trading company.
Gu said there were rumours the securities authorities planned to raise margin requirements for all futures trading from the current five percent to 15 or 20 percent, depending on the contract, to crack down further on speculation.
""If it happened, it wouldn't have a big impact on the Shanghai metals contracts, which are relatively mature and less speculative,"" Gu said.
But he said there was no need for the authorities to take a tough line on the Shanghai Metal Exchange.
""The speculative element in copper trading in Shanghai is relatively small and the futures trading here provides a valuable opportunity for hedging,"" he said.
He said that, currently, hedging accounted for about 20 percent of the trading in copper futures on the exchange, which he said was about the right level.
""The current margin requirement of metal contracts should be kept or at most increase it slightly,"" Gu added.",0
"China's personal bank deposits, which surged in the past two years to stratospheric levels, have begun to grow more slowly as a result of two bank interest rate cuts this year, bankers and analysts said on Wednesday.
But the growth rate is still high -- more than 30 percent year-on-year -- and the huge deposits in the banks still pose a threat to the economy, with the possibility of fanning inflation, if the money is released into the market, they said.
However, there is little chance that the deposits will be unleashed in the short term because the authorities are determined to maintain their tight monetary policy, they said.
By the end of 1995, individual Chinese deposits totalled 2,970 billion yuan ($3,578 billion), thanks largely to high interest rates set by authorities to drain money from the system and cool inflation, which hit a high of 21 percent in 1994, analysts said.
But the growth of the deposits began to slow down this year.
In the first quarter of 1996, individual bank deposits increased by 40.1 percent year-on-year, slowing to 34.5 percent growth in the third quarter, according to figures by the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
""The trend is changing,"" said a Beijing-based banker with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). ""With the central government reducing interest rates and supporting the securities market, some money is moving elsewhere.""
""Despite the change, the huge amount (of deposits) continues to be a tiger in a cage,"" said another banker with Shanghai-based Communications Bank. ""If released into the market, it would pose a serious threat to push inflation up again.""
The central bank sliced interest rates in May and August with the annual rate for one-year fixed deposits reduced to 7.47 percent after both cuts, from a very high 10.98 percent rate up to May.
In April, it also abolished an inflationary subsidy for long-term bank deposits of three years and above.
The cuts followed steady declines in the nation's inflation rate, which has dropped to about six percent this year from 14.7 percent last year.
Analysts said the interest rate cuts signalled a cautious relaxation of Beijing's tight monetary policy, begun in mid-1993 to cool an overheated economy characterised by surging inflation.
But Beijing will continue to keep a tight control on credit with the money supply remaining very high and the danger of reigniting inflation still present, they said.
""Experience since 1993 has proved that if we do not insist on tight monetary policy, high economic growth rates and the downward trend on inflation will be unsustainable,"" a central bank official said last week.
China's broad M2 supply increased by a year-on-year 26.9 percent by the end of September, slightly less than last year's 29.5 percent growth.
Beijing has set the M2 target at 25 percent for this year.
""The problem can only be solved when macro-economic conditions allow a complete relaxation of austerity measures and when interest rates are further cut to the level (where) the deposits can be gradually absorbed,"" said an ICBC official.

"China's domestic A shares continued to plummet on Thursday with investor confidence still in tatters following the rude shock of a government crackdown on the markets on Monday, traders said.
Shanghai's foreign currency B share index ended little changed at 64.343 points with bargain-hunting support prices, but A shares on the market fell 7.54 percent to 940.548.
On the Shenzhen stock market next to Hong Kong, the A share index plunged 8.7 percent to 357.85 points, while the B shares were also down sharply, losing 5.42 percent to 126.54 points.
""A growing number of investors want to leave the A and B markets, at least for a while,"" a Shenzhen trader said.
Brokers said Shanghai A shares plunged on unstable market sentiment and reported seeing some panic selling on rumours that more negative market news could be announced at the weekend.
""Retail investors used the opportunity of a technical rebound on Wednesday to offset their positions,"" said one broker. ""Sentiment is still weak.""
The Shanghai B share market is looking the healthiest of the China share markets in the wake of the crackdown in which the Beijing authorities said stock trading was overheated and warned of a crash if speculative trading was not stopped.
""Technical charts show the B share index is likely to consolidate between 63 and 65 points in the short term with investors targeting stocks with strong profits records,"" a second broker said.
Inner Mongolia Erdos Cashmere was the star on expectation of good results, rising $0.052 or 9.84 percent to $0.580, on volume of 1.7 million shares.
Shanghai Tyre & Rubber followed on institutional buying, up $0.034 or 8.21 percent to $0.448, on volume of 1.2 million shares.
In Shenzhen, brokers said the market was hit by institutions taking profits on the B share market with investors still jittery over Beijing's crackdown.
""Investors offset their positions whenever prices rose because they have little confidence in the market's short-term outlook after the falls earlier this week,"" an analyst said.
Many Shanghai B shares closed at the 10 percent limit-down with Dadonghai falling HK$0.36 to HK$3.20 on volume of 5.84 million shares on institutional selling, brokers said.
Changan Automobile traded the most on volume of 11.86 million shares, losing HK$0.20 to HK$3.55.
The A market plummeted with the majority of A shares closing at the 10 percent limit-down due to heavy selling in ""rubbish stocks"" -- shares of smaller firms with poor business results over the past few years, brokers said.
One Shenzhen broker predicted that the A shares could have a long way further to fall given their strong gains in the past few months.
But several Shenzhen counters with strong earnings records were seen being supported by institutional demand, brokers said.
Guangdong Power's A shares rose 0.93 yuan or 5.72 percent to 13.49 yuan, with its B shares up HK$0.35 or 6.36 percent to HK$5.85 per share, making them the best performers on the city's A and B share markets on Thursday.",0
"Australian investment and property group Lend Lease Corp and Thailand's Modern Home Co announced on Tuesday they would build a markets complex in Northern Bangkok that would be Asia's largest.
""The 160 hectare, A$1 billion (US$778 million) project aims to create a new industrial commercial and residential hub in northern Bangkok, anchored around what is currently being established as Asia's largest single agricultural produce and export market,"" Lend Lease and Modern Home said in a joint venture announcement.
""The joint venture brings together the local experience of Modern Home and Lend Lease's international resources and financial strength,"" they said.
Stage one of the project, which was 60 percent complete and projected to cost A$700 million, was already processing 15,000 tonnes of produce a day and had parking for 25,000 vehicles.
The complex, known as the Thai Markets project, would be located on the main northern road from Bangkok and be about 20 km from the airport.
""Located in a key location in North Bangkok, the Thai Market has been conceived to tap into the high growth agricultural and industrial sectors as Thailand emerges as the 'food bowl of Asia',"" the statement said.
The complex would eventually include food processing facilities so produce from surrounding areas could be packaged and processed for export.
The second and third stages, which would cost A$300 million, would include factories, retail outlets and homes to service the complex.
""There will also be a major discount retail and wholesale distribution facilities and shophouses,"" they said.
Lend Lease's Asian unit, based in Singapore, would contribute up to A$100 million to the joint venture for a 10 percent stake initially, with that percentage changing as the stages progressed.
The project is expected to take four years to complete.
A Lend Lease spokeswoman said she could not say how the percentage would change.
Modern Home chief executive Thanom Angkanawatana said the joint venture was a key step for his company.
""Lend Lease brings extensive experience, management skills and capital. Their international perspective will significantly strengthen the project and position future stages for the next upturn in the economy,"" Angkanawatana said in the statement.
""Completion of the adjacent Thammasart University and Asian Games complexes as well as continuing infrastructure investment in the area by the Thai government is expected to further benefit the project,"" the two partners said.
The state-owned Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) is backing the project and the Thai Ministry of Commerce also supports it, the Lend Lease spokeswoman said.
""The current success of the market project show, that it has strong fundamentals and makes it a good opportunity for Lend Lease,"" Lend Lease Asia managing director Richard Clarke said.
The announcement of the Thai joint venture is part of Lend Lease's widespread push into Asian property development.
Lend Lease announced on Monday it had formed a 50-50 joint venture with privately-owned U.S. firm Oakwood International Ltd to manage about 10,000 serviced apartments around Asia, including in Bangkok.
Lend Lease said it would initially contribute US$15 million for the management entity and would then seek additional capital.",0
"Westpac Banking Corp Ltd is expected to report on Tuesday that its net profit growth was reined back to a slower 10 percent in the 1995/96 year by an increasingly competitive home loan sector and a slower economy.
Analysts said the main focus in the results would be on how that increased competition and recent sharp cuts in home lending margins would hit Westpac's profits in 1996/97.
""You're really only going to have a full impact for the year ending September 1997,"" Morgan Stanley banking analyst John Hobson said of the sliding home loan margins.  
""There'll start to be a moderating influence (on profits) which intensifies throughout 1997,"" he said.
""You'll see fairly cautious statements being made at the briefing.""
The median forecast in BZW's BARCEPs analyst survey is for a net profit before abnormals for the year to September 30, 1996 of A$1.12 billion, up about 10 percent from A$1.02 billion in 1994/95.

"Australia's largest retailer, Coles Myer Ltd, forecast a rejuvenation in its profit outlook at its annual meeting on Tuesday but failed to stop shareholders launching into a six-hour tirade aimed at Coles' directors.
The prime target was former executive chairman Solomon Lew, who was re-elected as a director with the help of proxy votes after the floor of the meeting overwhelmingly rejected his re-election. Coles Chairman Nobby Clark, who was jeered when he tried to cut short debate on Lew's re-election, said Coles was seeing something of a rejuvenation in its businesses.  
""We're on the edge of something pretty good,"" Clark told the annual meeting. ""We do have an upside and I'm confident we can do better for you,"" he said.

"Rupert Murdoch predicted in a newspaper interview on Friday that his global media group News Corp Ltd was on track to boost profits 20 percent this year and would win its legal battle with Ted Turner and Time Warner.
Murdoch, visiting Australia for News' annual meeting next Tuesday, also told News' Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane that he did not want to buy out Australia's other major newspaper publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
News, which publishes the major tabloid newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne as well as the Courier Mail and The Australian, also owns about five percent of Fairfax.
Rejoining his recent feud with CNN owner Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch said he was confident News would win its law suit launched last week against Turner and Time Warner over their proposed merger.
""We've got a good stoush (fight) there,"" Murdoch said.
""We'll win through there. How or where I don't know but we'll just keep the pressure on,"" he said.
Turner said on Thursday that Murdoch's lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc and Time Warner was a ""frivolous piece of junk.""
Murdoch and Turner have fought a pitched business battle in recent months over Turner's plans to merge his Cable News Network (CNN) with Time Warner, creating the world's largest media group.
At issue is whether Time Warner, the United States' second largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch's soon-to-be launched competitor to CNN.
News Corp is claiming US$1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News' 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition.
""They promised me very firmly we'd have nine million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren't there,"" Murdoch said of the Time Warner decision.
Turner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic.
Murdoch also reaffirmed News' bullish outlook for profits.
""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly (the 20 percent rise is attainable),"" he told the Courier Mail.
""But it is still early days to be saying that,"" the newspaper quoted Murdoch as saying.
News said after its 1995/96 results in late August that a 20-percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was very attainable. News posted a A$1.02 billion (US$790 million) net profit in 1995/96.
But it did not repeat the 20-percent forecast in its annual report last month, creating some doubt about the outlook.
Murdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes the major broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News' major competitor in newspapers.
But he said Australian-based rival mogul Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon if current goverment restrictions were lifted.
""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he said.
""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price.""
Murdoch also criticised the conservative government of Australian prime minister John Howard for not implementing radical economic reforms immediately.",0
"Dairy and fruit juice group National Foods Ltd said on Tuesday its reforms announced in July were now almost fully completed and the group was poised for above-budget profit growth in the next six to nine months.
""It's almost fully implemented,"" outgoing National Foods managing director Graham Reaney told Reuters in an interview.
""The real benefits start to emerge as people become more familiar with the new structures and clearly there'll be gains over the next six to nine months,"" Reaney said.  
Earlier on Tuesday National Foods posted a 17.3 percent higher operating profit before tax of A$37.6 million for the year to June 30.
Its net profit rose to A$15.05 million from A$10.77 million after an abnormal loss of A$7.89 million.
Net profit before abnormals rose to A$22.7 million from A$19.2 million, against analysts' expectations of about A$23 million.
National Foods said in announcing its results, earnings for July and August were ahead of budget and comfortably ahead of last year.  
Reaney repeated that this meant that 1996/97 profits were likely to be higher than in 1995/96, but he would not say how much higher. ""But its clearly going in the right direction.""
The reforms had created a more efficient distribution system for chilled foods, increasing sales coverage for National Foods' products, Reaney said.
""It's a combination of cost reduction and enhanced distribution, and looking at our beverage division, our flavoured milks are performing particularly strongly,"" he said.
""There are a number of areas that starting to perform a lot better for us.""  
Reaney said the sale of non-core assets had also been completed and the company was now focused on extracting profit growth from existing assets.
""We would consider all businesses that we have today as core businesses,"" he said, adding, however, that he could not rule out future acquisitions.
""But the first objective to make those assets that we currently own work better, produce more profit, more cash flow.""
Singapore's Camerlin Pte Ltd has about eight percent of National Foods and Hong Kong's Mingly Corp has about 10.4 percent of the company.  
Reaney said he would not comment on shareholders' intentions or actions or whether either of the Asian-based investors planned any takeover or had brought on any board room reshuffle.
He said he had resigned the managing director's position having worked for the company for five years. ""Five to seven years is a normal period for a chief executive and quite genuinely I do have other things to do,"" he said.
""I'm quite relaxed and if it wasn't an amicable arrangement I wouldn't be staying on as a non-executive director,"" he said on his last day in the job.  
Reaney's replacement, Max Ould, was chief executive of Peters Foods until April and presided over the transfer of operations from Pacific Dunlop Ltd to Nestle Australia.

"Australia-based transport equipment hire and logistics firm, Brambles Industries Ltd, reported a 15.8 percent profit lift for the 1995/96 year on Friday despite flat Australian and European economies.
Surging profits from Brambles' U.S. and European CHEP pallet hire joint venture with Britain's GKN Plc compensated for otherwise slow growth from Australia, the company said.  
""The continuing improvement in our performance reflects, in part, the successful retionalisation of our wholly owned businesses and strong growth from our CHEP joint ventures,"" Brambles Chief Executive John Fletcher said.
""CHEP USA, in particular, continues to justify our confidence in its long term growth prospects in the region,"" he said in Bramble's profit statements.
Brambles' net profit rose to A$215.1 million (US$169.9 million) for the year to June 30, 1997 from A$97.7 million in 1994/95, but the previous year's result was undermined by a large abnormal loss.  
Pre-abnormal profits for 1995/96 rose 15.8 percent to A$214.8 million, at the top end of analysts' expectations.
Pre-tax profits rose 13 percent and 30 percent from Europe and the United States respectively, while Australian profits rose eight percent.
""Overseas profits grew at twice the rate in Australia and the trend is likely to continue,"" Fletcher said.
""In particular we expect further contributions from CHEP in Europe and North America,"" he said.  
Fletcher later told Reuters this strong peformance from Bramble's non-Australian operations had encouraged it to actively look at further acquisitions outside Australia.
""You should anticipate some acquisition work in the Northern Hemisphere, but in businesses we already operate in here,"" he said, referring to areas like transport equipment rentals and records managements.
Looking ahead, he said strong contributions from the United States and Europe should continue to offset soft Australian conditions and help produce profit growth.  
""We haven't got an expectation that we will get too much help from this economy ... for at least another six months,"" he said. ""But all in all we've got enough things going to see another (profit) increase for this year,"" he added.
The result generally pleased analysts, who also pointed to the strong U.S. pallet operations as the main bullish note.
""CHEP USA is the outstanding area,"" said Macquarie Equities analyst Ian Myles.
""As long as they're saying positive things about CHEP in the USA then they'll be alright and there's a reasonable amount of momentum there,"" another Sydney transport analyst said.

"Appliance and building products manufacturer Email Ltd reported a lower half year net profit and dividend on Monday but forecast that recent restructuring and a seasonal lift would boost profits in the second half.

""Nevertheless, the significant improvements in the company's pre-tax operating profits flowing from restructuring across the past 12 months, are expected to continue in the second half,"" the company said in a statement accompanying half year results.
""As well there should be the normal seasonal lift in sales and margins, leading to a second half profit well ahead of the first half,"" it said.
Earlier Email reported a pre-abnormal net profit of A$27.26 million for the first half to September 30, up from A$24.83 million the previous corresponding half a year earlier.  
Net profit however fell to A$23.85 million from A$26.61 million the previous year, due largely to abnormal losses of A$3.41 million incurred in restructuring and reducing overheads. Email also cut its interim dividend to eight cents from 11.5 a year earlier, saying it had realigned dividends to reflect the stronger second half year in the light of continuing uncertainty about the economy.
Email Managing Director John Hanna later told Reuters Email expected pre-tax profits for the second half of the 1996/97 year would also be above those in the second half of 1995/96.  
""We are expecting in the second half that we would have pre-tax operating profits higher than last year,"" Hanna said.
""We should also have the second half seasonal lift.""
He said Email was pleased that it achieved profit growth in its building products and major appliances divisions despite lower sales.
Analysts said the result was within expectations and was largely unsurprising, even with the dividend cut.
""It's still a high payout ratio,"" said one Sydney analyst said of the dividend, noting that the final dividend was likely to be maintained.  
Email's share price was unchanged at A$3.55 at 1.10 p.m. (0210 GMT) on light volumes.
Hanna said there could begin to be an upturn in the housing industry at the beginning of 1997, but that this would take some time to flow through to Email's business because its products were installed late in the building process.
""If it (the upturn) was early 1997, then it (the resulting flow-on) would be in mid-1997,"" he said.
But this flow-on effect would then have an immediate effect on Email's bottom line because of the recent restructuring which had reduced overheads.  
""As there's an upturn, we should get that immediately and a lot of that will go to the bottom line immediately,"" Hanna said.
He also said Email may increase its 20 percent stake in British electricity meter maker Ampy Automation Digilog Ltd.
""There may be an opportunity to lift that stake in the future,"" Hanna said. He said Email remained on the lookout for further acquisitions.
""They (any further acquisitions) would have to be in existing core areas ... but I don't think we have anything directly in line at the moment,"" he said.",0
"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is likely to benefit from the planned US$20 billion merger of MCI Communications Corp and British Telecommunications Plc , Australian media analysts said on Monday.
They said News, which already has a wide-ranging partnership with MCI, would strengthen its global media interests on the coat-tails of the creation of the world's second largest telecommunications group.
""It means they'll be in bed with a bigger more powerful global telephony group,"" one senior Sydney media analyst said.  
Analysts also said the BT-MCI merger would stabilise New Corp's partnership with MCI, which had seemed increasingly strained in recent months. ""It seems that MCI and News haven't been getting on lately, whereas News and BT have been getting on a lot better,"" said the senior Sydney analyst.
The prospect of MCI selling its nine percent stake in News Corp over the next year had suppressed News Corp's shares in the last month. ""There was a view that MCI wasn't real happy with it (the partership) and may sell out, but now nothing's going to happen for 12 months at least,"" said another Sydney analyst.  
""The implications for News are quite positive,"" the analyst said.
A Melbourne analyst said some in the market were a bit worried that MCI was preparing to  to sell down their stake over the next 12 months. ""The fact that BT may combine with MCI reduces that risk for now at least,"" the analyst said.
MCI and News Corp announced a broad alliance in May 1995, under which MCI bought a nine percent stake in News for US$1.35 billion and acquired an option to increase that stake up to 13.5 percent. They agreed, amoug other things, to jointly set up an American satelite television operation -- ASkyB.  
But progress with ASkyB has been slow and other smaller joint ventures have failed to fire.
However, the Australian analysts said they would remain somewhat cautious given bearish comments on Sunday by MCI.
MCI announced that it would cut its stake in ASkyB to 20 percent from 50 percent.
Analysts said this was not surprising as News Corp and MCI had said recently they wanted new partners in the venture.  
But MCI Chief Executive Bert Roberts also told Reuters on Sunday that no major new launches were expected from the venture with News Corp and that MCI would sell to News a US$700 million satellite license if it could.
He also said MCI was unlikely to take up its option to increase its stake in News, a comment seen by analysts as symptomatic of Roberts' increasing unhappiness with the deal.
Analysts also said there was the potential for a regulatory block to links between News, its 40 percent owned BSkyB Plc and BT.  
""There's an outside risk that British regulatory bodies could try and block the News-BSkyB-BT side of it,"" said another BT analyst.
Other analysts said the dilution involved, with BT owning nine percent of a 40 percent stake in BSkyB, would assuage regulatory concerns. The likely election of a British Labour government also reduced that risk.
""They're banking on (Labour leader) Tony Blair winning government and deregulating cross media rules in the United Kingdom,"" said another Sydney analyst.  
However another analyst pointed to the recent banning by British regulator Oftel of a joint marketing campaign between BT and BSkyB as a sign of the rocky road ahead for News and BT.",0
"Rupert Murdoch on Tuesday reported that News Corp. Ltd. had performed below expectations in the first quarter, but he said the global media group was still on track for a 20 percent profit rise this year.
Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corp., also unveiled a more conservative approach to financing new acquisitions.
""I am on record as saying that we expect a 20 percent increase in profit for the year,"" Murdoch told a packed News Corp. annual meeting in Adelaide.
""We still expect that and are still aiming for that during the coming year. However, I should say that the first quarter may not be quite up to those expectatations, but we will certainly be striving to make up any shortfall,"" Murdoch said.
Analysts viewed the comments as disappointing and said they were now more sceptical about the 20 percent profit pledge.
""If they can't meet expectations in the first quarter, when they have those strong revenues from 'Independence Day,"" then what hope do they have of getting 20 percent in the full year?"" asked one Sydney-based media analyst referring to a hit Hollywood movie made by News Corp's Fox studio.
Traders on the Australian share market did not like the first quarter comment either, selling the shares 14 cents or almost two percent lower to close at A$7.20 ($5.69), while the broader Australian stock market closed at a record high.
In the 1995/96 year ended June 30, News Corp's net profit slipped to A$1.02 billion ($806 million) from A$1.37 billion in 1994/95 ($1.08 billion).
Murdoch said revenues at the Fox U.S. television business had begun 1996/97 slowly because of of the Atlanta Olympic Games, the rights to which were held by a rival network.
Australian newspaper revenues would be flat in 1996/97, said Murdoch.
But he remained buoyant about News' British operations, saying the advertising market there was booming and the partly-owned BSkyB pay television operation was growing strongly.
Murdoch then unveiled a more cautious strategy for financing future expansion.
""As far as possible, we will finance them (News' expansion plans) out of current cash flow to maintain liquidity so that we will be ready to take new opportunities as they arise,"" he said.
News has often funded its aggressive growth in pay television and other media through either hefty debt or equity issues, which have sometimes met shareholder resistance. It almost collapsed under a debt mountain in the early 1990s.",0
"Rupert Murdoch predicted he would win his legal battle with Ted Turner and Time Warner Inc. and said his global media company, News Corp. Ltd., was on track to boost profits 20 percent this year.
In remarks published in News Corp.'s Courier Mail newspaper in Brisbane, Murdoch also was quoted as saying that he did not want to buy out Australia's other major newspaper publisher, John Fairfax Holdings Ltd.
News Corp. publishes major tabloid newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne, the Courier Mail and The Australian, also owns about 5 percent of Fairfax.
Discussing his recent feud with CNN founder Ted Turner and Time Warner, Murdoch said he was confident News Corp. would win its lawsuit against the $6.7 billion merger of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and New York-based Time Warner, which was completed on Thursday after shareholders of both companies approved the deal.
""We've got a good stoush (fight) there,"" Murdoch said. ""We'll win through there. How or where I don't know but we'll just keep the pressure on,"" he said.
Turner said on Thursday that Murdoch's lawsuit to block the merger of Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner, which creates the world's biggest media company, was a ""frivolous piece of junk.""
Murdoch and Turner have fought a pitched battle in recent months over the merger. At issue is whether Time Warner, the United States' second-largest cable operator, will carry Murdoch's new all-news channel that will compete with CNN.
News Corp. is seeking $1 billion in damages from Time Warner and Turner, saying their decision not to carry News Corp.'s 24-hour Fox News Service showed they were stifling competition.
""They promised me very firmly we'd have 9 million subscribers and when the day came to sign the document, they weren't there,"" Murdoch said in the interview, referring to Time Warner's decision not to carry the new channel.
Turner was forced to apologise last week for comparing Murdoch to Adolf Hitler, while Murdoch has described CNN as liberal and his executives have said Turner was monopolistic.
Murdoch also confirmed his bullish outlook for News Corp.'s profits.
""If the American economy holds where it is and the British one does, yes certainly,"" a 20 percent rise in profits is attainable, he told the Courier Mail. ""But it is still early days to be saying that.""
News Corp. said after releasing its results in late August that a 20 percent profit rise in the year to June 30, 1997 was attainable. News earned A$1.02 billion ($790 million) net profit in fiscal 1996.
Murdoch also said he had no plans to buy out John Fairfax Holdings, which publishes broadsheet newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and is News Corp.'s major competitor in newspaper market.
He said Australian-based rival media owner Kerry Packer was also unlikely to bid for Fairfax any time soon.
""I don't want to buy Fairfax. I don't believe Mr. (Kerry) Packer wants to buy Fairfax,"" he was quoted as saying.
""To my knowledge he (Packer) has three times tried to sell his shares within the last 12 months. He'd like to influence and have the power of Fairfax but he's too shrewd to be paying for Fairfax at today's price.""
Canada's Conrad Black, whose Hollinger International Inc. owns 25 percent of Fairfax and who has expressed a desire to take control of the group, expressed surprise at Murdoch's comments.
""(Murdoch's statement) is fairly humorous. It's a bit rich given the fact that he never stops telling me how much he would like to own Fairfax,"" Black said by telephone Friday.
""I cannot obviously comment on what the others are doing or what Rupert's motives are. The fact is that he regularly expresses to me considerable hypothetical interest in Fairfax,"" he said.
Hollinger International owns the Chicago Sun-Times, daily and weekly publications in the United States and the Jerusalem Post.",0
"Almost 300 students and workers from the islands of Kiribati were adrift in the central Pacific on Wednesday aboard a crowded charter ship crippled by a fire, officials said.
The 1,000-tonne MV Maasmond appealed for help on Tuesday night after losing power through the fire in the engine room.
It was found by a Royal New Zealand Airforce Orion rescue plane drifting about 800 kms (500 miles) east of the Kiribati island of Tarawa with 290 passengers on board.
""The Orion located it this afternoon and was told via radio that it's in no immediate distress and has enough food and water for five days,"" Airforce Squadron Leader Ron Irons told Reuters from the RNZAF's base in Nandi, Fiji.
""It has partially restored its electric power, but it has no wasy to start its engine,"" Irons said.
An electrical fire in a switchboard in the engine room shut down the ship's electrical systems late on Tuesday, leaving the converted freighter without power and still two days sailing from the nearest land.
The ship's charterer, Kiribati businessman Waysang Kumkee, said the MV Maasmond's insurers would pay for another ship to tow it back to Tarawa.
The 64.5-metre (210 foot) Maasmond was chartered to carry 290 passengers, mostly Kiribati students and workers, and 400 tonnes of cargo to Christmas Island from Tarawa, Kumkee said.
A tugboat was likely to take two days to reach the stricken ship and another two days to tow it back to Tarawa, he said, adding the passengers had plenty of food and water to last the four days.
""It's not a problem. If they run out they can easily borrow some of the cargo,"" Kumkee told Reuters by telephone from Tarawa, one of a group of coral atolls about 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) north-east of Sydney.
The cargo included rice and tinned food.
None of the passengers or crew had been injured in the fire and the only problem on board was likely to be boredom given the ship's video players were out of action. ""With no videos, they'll be a bit bored,"" Kumkee said.
Most of the passengers were sitting or sleeping under canvas on blankets on the deck, he said.
They would be reduced to playing cards and their guitars until their rescue, he added.
The MV Maasmond is registered in Kingstown in St Vincent and Grenadines, according to the Lloyds List, and has had engine trouble in the past.
In 1992, it underwent engine repairs for ten weeks after encountering cyclones on a cruise through the Pacific.",0
"An inquiry into Australia's financial system has left open the option of mergers among Australia's big banks and takeovers of local banks by foreign banks in an interim discussion paper released on Wednesday.
The inquiry, established by the government and headed by prominent businessman Stan Wallis, outlined various options for reform and was careful not to state its own preferences.
But it said the key aim of any reforms should be increasing the efficiency of Australia's banks to compete globally and that new technology would transform the sector. Big banks such as the National Australia Bank Ltd have used the same reasoning lobbying for relaxed merger rules.
The banks have said big bank mergers are necessary to compete globally and new technology such as the Internet and global competition meant such mergers would not cut competition.
Policy set by the former Labor government has stopped mergers or foreign takeovers of Australia's four largest banks and its two largest insurance and superannuation groups.
The current conservative coalition government has said this so-called ""six pillars"" policy will remain in place until it has considered the Wallis inquiry's recommendations, due to be delivered by the end of March 1997.
""The Inquiry sees as its key goal the identification of means to increase the efficiency of the Australian financial system, without compromising its safety and peformance,"" the paper said. Increased efficiency was needed to complete globally, to obtain the benefits of new technology and to increase investment returns, the paper said. It asked if competition and innovation could be stimulated by widening access to traditional banking activities through:
* ""Allowing direct non-bank access to the payments settlement system""
* Better accomodating financial conglomerates
* Allowing an increased range of institutions to provide a wider array of financial services, or
* relaxing some of the ownership restrictions on financial institutuions ?""
The inquiry said it was also wanted any reforms to increase competition and asked in that context ""whether there are any public policy grounds for restrictions on foreign acquisitions in the banking or insurance industries?""
In discussing the details of how bank mergers might be approved, the inquiry said there was widespread consensus that banks should be subject to the same competition rules as other industries. Currently any bank merger must be approved by the government through the Treasurer and by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). This dual approval process does not apply in other industries.  
""In undertaking its assessment, the Inquiry notes its preference...for all sectors of the economy to be subject to a uniform set of competitionpolicy laws unless there is something sepcial which justifies different treatment,"" the paper said.
The Inquiry said it would consider the following options for merger approvals, including;
* keeping the current system of dual approval
* having the Treasurer accept the ACCC's decision, or * narrowing powers over mergers in banking and insurance law It said there would be no need for a 'six pillars' policy if the Treasurers powers were removed or if he agreed not to excercise them. ""There was almost unanimous support that the 'six pillars' policy should be abolished,"" the paper said.",0

"Australian-based metals recycler Simsmetal Ltd on Friday painted a bleak picture for world scrap metal prices over the year ahead and said this meant the group's net profit for 1996/97 would be lower than in 1995/96.
But it said it remained confident it could take advantage of a recovery in world markets when it came and was currently in talks to buy a large British scrap metal business.
Simsmetal managing director John Crabb told the annual meeting that scrap prices had softened dramatically to their lowest levels in almost four years over the last two months.  
""Until there is an improvement in the major economies of Europe and Asia and the resulting increase in demand for metals, we expect trading conditions to remain very difficult with volumes, margins and earnings below our expectations,"" Crabb said.
He later told reporters profits for the year to June 30, 1997 would be below the A$46.7 million posted in 1995/96 -- a result that was itself 23 percent down on a year ago.
""It will be lower for the full year,"" Crabb said.  
Simsmetal had previously only said it saw difficult conditions prevalent in the first quarter of 1996/97 continuing into the second quarter, with second quarter profits falling.
In mid-October, Simsmetal announced its net profit for the first quarter of 1996/97 fell 34 percent to A$8.28 million.
Crabb said the world construction markets which used the long steel produced by electric furnaces supplied by Simsmetal remained weak and had no immediate prospect of improvement.
""Our view is that we should start to see some improvement (in ferrous metals prices) towards the end of calendar 1997, we may see it in the middle (of calendar 1997),"" he said.  
""We can't see too much on the horizon at this time,"" he said.
Crabb also said Simsmetal was in talks to buy a large British business in the same area as Simsmetal, but he said he could not give any more details as he was bound by confidentiality agreements.
""It's in the U.K. For us it will be quite large,"" he said.
""We still need to balance our portfolio there, so that we've got a good broad coverage,"" he said.
""We'll use either some cash or our unusued borrowing lines. We've got no problems funding it.""  
He said Simsmetal had ended the first quarter with about A$62 million cash on hand.
""I guess we'd only be using 55-60 percent of our borrowing capacity at the moment.""
Simsmetal had total non-current borrowings of A$54.11 million as at June 30, 1996, giving a total warchest for possible acquisitions of about A$115 million.
Earlier in the annual meeting, Crabb said that any closure of the Broken Hill Pty Co Pty Ltd's Newcastle steel plant would not affect Simsmetals operations.  
Crabb said Simsmetal supplies most of its products to BHP's Sydney mini-mill and its Port Kembla plant, south of Sydney.
""Maybe it will make life easier for us because we will be able to buy more scrap,"" Crabb said, responding to a shareholders question.

"The Brunei Investment Agency (BIA) on Tuesday bought a 13.4 percent stake in Macquarie Bank Ltd, removing the links between one of Australia's top four investment banks and its British founder.
Macquarie said in a stock exchange statement just after the start of morning trading that the Brunei government-owned agency paid Lloyds TSB Plc A$151.7 million (US$122.8 million) for the stake.
The purchase by the agency's Brunei Investment and Commercial Bank (BICB) from Lloyds' Hill Samuel & Co unit makes it the largest individual shareholder in Macquarie.
Macquarie Bank managing director Allan Moss said the bank had developed a good relationship with BIA and its senior management over the months it had taken to arrange the deal.
""We are delighted that they have become associated with the bank as a major shareholder, and we are confident that BICB will prove to be a constructive and long term investor in Macquarie,"" Moss said.
The purchase ends Hill Samuel's 27-year direct involvement in the Australian investment banking sector.
Hill Samuel set up what is now known as Macquarie Bank in 1969 before selling down its stake to 30 percent in 1985 and then down to 15 percent in 1993.
Since then Macquarie, which now has 1,800 staff, has listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and is now one of Australia's top 100 companies.
It has offices throughout Australasia and in China, Singapore, Malaysia, London, Munich, New York, Hong Kong, Indonesia and South Africa. Its asset base stood at A$5.17 billion on March 31, the end of its financial year.
Macquarie also has more than A$20 billion in assets under management and has operations in corporate finance, sharebroking and in commodities, debt and foreign exchange trading.
It posted net profits of A$93.2 million in 1995/96.
Macquarie Equities ranks amoung the top four brokers in terms of turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange and had the biggest inflow of retail funds for management in the year to June 30, 1996.
Macquarie chairman David Clarke told a news conference he was confident that BICB was a stable shareholder.
""By and large you only read announcements of them buying things and investing in things you don't read about them selling out of things,"" Clarke said.
The sale of the Hill Samuel stake appears to remove from the market a convenient bridgehead for a takeover bid from another Australian bank.
Australia's conservative government is currently reconsidering financial regulations governing bank takeovers.

"Transport and logistics group TNT Ltd said on Wednesday it was well placed for quite strong profit growth in the current 1996/97 year, but would continue to look at selling its currently unprofitable non-core assets.
""We haven't got any numbers, but it should be quite strong relative to the position we're starting from,"" TNT Managing Director David Mortimer said of prospective profit growth, in an interview with Reuters.  
Mortimer said the non-core activities that slowed down TNT's earnings in 1995/96 were its general freight business in Australia and its Brazilian operations.
""We've dealt with the LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed and we've sold Brazil,"" he said.
""What's the saying...when in doubt shoot it or fix it.""
TNT would also look to sell other unprofitable non-core businesses, Mortimer said.
""We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform then they will be vulnerable to sale,"" he said.  
One of those non core activities is TNT's 50 percent interest in airliner leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide. News Corp Ltd owns the other half.
Mortimer said he had consistently said that Ansett Worldwide's capital base needed to be restructured to give it cheaper access to capital so it could compete properly.
""In its present structure, it's difficult for it to be optimised for News and TNT ownership because it needs access to capital at an effective rate,"" he said.

He said profits from these core activities of domestic and international time-sensitive freight and logistics had grown 48.7 percent to A$165.3 million in 1995/96.
TNT had moved to excise these loss-making units and focus on profitable core activities, he said.
""We've dealt with the (Australian) LCL (Less Than Container Load) business -- that's been closed, and we've sold Brazil,"" he said.
""What's the saying ... when in doubt shoot it or fix it.""
TNT would also look to sell other unprofitable, non-core businesses, Mortimer said. ""We've got other non-core activities and to the extent that they don't perform, then they will be vulnerable to sale
""The inconsistency in our results has come from these fringe activities...it's that volatility around the earnings base that says we have to concentrate on core activities and get out of the non-core 'riff-raff,' if you like,"" he said.
Earlier this week TNT announced the finalisation of plans to sell its stake in Ansett to Air New Zealand Ltd for cash receipts of A$325 million. The other 50 percent of Ansett is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.
TNT's remaining non-core activities include an airline leasing company jointly owned with News Corp, some shipping operations between New Zealand and Australia, a mono-rail in Sydney and some information technology assets.
Mortimer would not single out any of these as potential immediate sale prospects, but said they were vulnerable while they were not making profits.
He said the airline leasing firm, Ansett Worldwide, needed to have its capital base restructured before it could be sold.
Shareholders, however, took the profit slump in their stride, having actually forecast a slight loss rather than a slight profit.
Net profit before abnormals, but after preference dividends, fell to A$0.6 million from A$38.48 million in 1994/95.
Analysts had expected a pre-abnormal, post preferences loss of between A$4 million and A$22 million.

"Gold miner Niugini Mining Ltd, which owns 17.15 percent of the shares in Papua New Guinea's Lihir Gold Ltd, said on Monday it was looking at ways of giving those Lihir shares back to its shareholders.
""We're looking at the possibility of returning the Lihir shareholding to shareholders and when that can be done,"" Nuigini Mining chief executive Ian Goudie told Reuters.
Goudie said a straight forward return of the shares to shareholders could not approved until late 1998 given the Lihir mine's current debt arrangements.  
But Nuigini was also looking at other structures through which the shares could be returned before then, he said.
He said the Lihir share return was just one of several possible ways of unlocking the true value of the Lihir stake, which was not reflected in Niugini's current share price.
""The whole purpose is to unlock this mismatch,"" he said.
Niugini's assets could viewed in two parts -- the Lihir stake and other smaller mining assets, he said.
""If the two parts were to be separated they would appear to have more value to shareholders.""",0
"Misys, Britain's fast-growing, 950 million pound ($1.5 billion) software supplier, posted record half-year results on Wednesday and said it was eyeing up to five international acquisition targets worth up to $30 million each.
Chairman Kevin Lomax told Reuters that Misys, which has snapped up software trading firms in South East Asia, Ireland, the U.S. and Europe, was keen on businesses that operated within a strong international financial services market.
""They (possible acquisition targets) are worth mainly between $2.0 million and $30 million...,"" Lomax said.
Misys, whose banking division alone now supplies software to 12,000 banks with 4,000 separate installations, has become one of the world's largest application software companies as consolidation in the industry gathers pace.
And with 18.7 million pounds of cash and undisclosed, but low debt levels, Lomax said the company had plently of headroom in its cash flow and borrowing facilities to enable it to embark again on the acquisition trail.
Only last month, Misys announced the planned $60 million acquistion of Summit Systems, a New York computer company specialising in financial derivatives trading software.
Supplying software to banks and insurers has brought rich rewards to Misys. The group raised pretax profits in the half year by 23 percent to 23.7 million pounds on revenues of 129.5 million pounds -- 10 percent higher than in the last half year.
Lomax said he saw the possibility of ""creating quite a bit of shareholder value"" by buying regional software companies, particularly in the banking industry.
The group has bought software businesses in risk management, private banking, corporate electronic banking, derivatives trading, capital markets trading --- areas where banks and securities firms want to expand and control their activities.
In the last 12 months, Misys's shares have more than doubled to 1140 pence from 567 pence as the group systematically targets international financial institutions that need new software at lower costs but with a greater security of transactions.
Lomax insists that he is unworried by the share price, which at about 20 times prospective earnings, no longer looks cheap. Competitors' price/earnings ratios are comparable, he says.
But the stock has slipped recently, and was trading 2.5 pence weaker at 1115p by 1115 GMT -- despite the strong results.
In terms of international banking, Misys is three to five times bigger than its competitors. Large rivals such as Reuters Holdings Plc and America's SunGard Data Systems impinge only on parts of its market, Lomax noted.
""Nobody of any serious calibre or size competes across the board with us.""
The group lifted its half year dividend 15 percent to 4.57p.",0
"Cable & Wireless (C&W) on Friday brushed aside speculation that its landmark merger with three companies had run into hurdles and said it had got the man it wanted to run what will be Britain's biggest cable firm.
In a long-awaited statememt, C&W said it would appoint Graham Wallace as chief executive of Cable and Wireless Communications, formed by merging C&W's Mercury unit, Nynex Corp's NYNEX CableComms Group, Bell Cablemedia Plc, and Videotron Holdings Plc.
""Graham Wallace is the one we wanted,"" C&W chief executive Richard Brown told Reuters in an interview.
""He is the first choice and we're delighted to get him.""
Wallace, who will join C&W on February 1, is currently a director at leisure and media company Granada Group. But he brings with him useful experience in television from a stint on the board of satellite broadcaster BSkyB.
C&W, is mainly a telecommunications business and has little previous experience in television.
But one analyst gave the appointment a lukewarm reception.
""It's not an obvious choice,"" said the analyst. ""He strikes me as very competent, but does he know anything about the cable business? I'm not quite sure why they didn't go for one of the insiders. There were some strong people, I thought.""
Although C&W's shares were languishing 2.5 pence lower at 485.5 pence in late afternoon trade, NYNEX CableComms saw its shares rise 5.5 pence to 108.5 pence.
With C&W, Britain's second biggest telecoms company, planning to finalise the cable merger in spring, the lack of a chief executive at the new company had fuelled some speculation that a clash of cultures was hindering talks.
Although Brown conceded that the merger was complicated, he insisted: ""That is not true...There's a great deal of activity and we really are right on track.
""There is an exciting spirit of cooperation to bring this to reality,"" he said.
Brown, who will take the chair of the company, tipped to be worth 5.0 billion pounds ($8.36 billion), said a finance director would be the next announcement.
The proposed cable merger was announced last October -- and most such deals spell job cuts.
Although Brown said he was not legally allowed to comment ahead of Cable and Wireless Communications's planned listing in London and New York, he warned that the new group would ""clearly"" reap efficiencies.
""I cannot quantify what that is going to be, but we are working on that and we will achieve that,"" he said.
Cable and Wireless Communications, which will be well-placed to compete against dominant telecoms company British Telecommunications, will provide local, national and international data and mobile telecommunications with multi-channel television and Internet services.",0
"Orange Plc said on Monday its customers will be able to use their mobile phones to chat, transfer data and send faxes in Germany, France, Switzerland, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore by the end of 1997.
Announcing a roaming agreement with Swiss state-owned telecoms monopoly Swiss PTT, Orange Group technical and operations director Colin Tucker said he hoped customers would also soon be able to ""roam"" freely in Hong Kong and Scandinavia.
""I suppose the thing to say is, Watch this space,"" he told a news conference in Geneva.  
The introduction of digital equipment has helped fuel the battle to add value to the basic mobile telephone by allowing free roaming from country to country and far more reliable and secure connections.
Orange's 573,000 subscribers will be able to sign up for these enhanced services if they pass stringent credit checks and pay a 250 stg deposit to help curtail the fraud that has dogged similar previous agreements.
Orange already has a full roaming agreement in Germany and a partial one in France, centred on Paris. Talks are under way to add a number of European and Asian nations to the list.  
As with all roaming agreements, the financial details of the Swiss deal remain a trade secret. Initially, only subscribers in Geneva will be able to use Swiss PTT's Natel City network but Orange aims to boost coverage to Basel and Zurich by early 1997.
Orange says its offer of roaming services between the UK and other countries is part of its aim to provide customers with the best value for money. It notes that a significant proportion of users regularly use its established German services.
""Adding Geneva as another roaming service demonstrates our commitment to providing an international continuity of service,"" Tucker said.  
The system that Orange uses is much like that of market leaders Vodafone Group and British Telecom's 60 percent-owned Cellnet, in that they are based on the GSM (global system for mobile communications) sister technology called DCS-1800, which operates at 1800 MHz as opposed to 900 MHz.
Most of Cellnet's and Vodafone's subscribers are on the increasingly crowded analogue networks while Orange, along with rival Cable and Wireless- and U S West -owned Mercury One 2 One, is wholly digital.  
As mobile phone companies vie to lift the market out of its yuppie ghetto and into the mass market, the challenge for newcomers like Orange -- with its monthly rental packages that include free minutes and per-second charges -- is to attract customers who still have no mobile phone.
It also has to catch those as they move from the older analogue networks to the new digital technology. Orange, which last month reported gaping first-half pretax losses of 125.2 million stg, has seen its shares fall well short of the 205 pence level of its March flotation that valued the company at about 2.5 billion stg.
But the company, partly owned by Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchison Wam Poa and British Aerospace, says its expects to turn in a profit or pay shareholders a dividend by 1998.",0
"Intel Corp launched its new Pentium chip with multimedia extension (MMX) technology on Wednesday, promising TV-quality video, stereo surround sound and three-dimensional graphics for personal computers.
The world's largest computer chip maker, Intel has collaborated with more than 100 software developers, some of which have created programs such as UbiSoft's dizzying new car race game called Pod' especially for Intel's Pentium processors that have the new MMX technology.
""This means life-like colour, full screen video and graphics, CD (compact disk) quality stereo sound, real-time animation and a better Internet experience,"" Intel said.
Long-awaited in the computer market, the MMX has helped drive Intel shares to record levels over recent weeks and is expected by industry watchers to boost computer sales.
Intel shares rose a further four dollars on Tuesday to $143-3/8 but were down slightly in active early Wednesday trade.
Trumpeting MMX as a ""giant leap forward"" for PC users, European technology director Ian Wilson told Reuters that new multimedia software written to take advantage of MMX technology ran up to 60 percent faster than on Intel's previous Pentium processors. Existing software runs up to 10-20 percent faster.
Intel says the new technology will boost computer sales and soon become an industry standard.
""The new features we have introduced with MMX technology allow a much better, richer multi-media experience...and we'll see a home and consumer demand for PCs growing even more,"" Wilson said.
Intel said that for the first time in its history, a wide range of consumer software was available right at launch to exploit the powers of the new chip.
The MMX chip will initially be offered with the 166 and 200 MHz Pentium processors, improving the performance of personal computer-based multimedia and high-speed communications with faster ""modems"" for speeding access to the Internet.
A host of computer manufacturers are offering the Pentium MMX processor, including America's International Business Machines Corp, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Italy's Olivetti and Japan's Toshiba.
British electrical retail chain Dixons said new Pentium processors with MMX technology would be available in some of its stores from Wednesday.
Wilson said he expected systems incorporating the new MMX technology to retail at between $1,500 and $2,000.
Analysts have estimated that Intel could sell 30 million to 45 million MMX chips this year -- about half of the microprocessor units it will sell this year.
But Wilson declined to comment on shipments, saying only: ""By end of year, a significant percentage of our microprocessors being shipped will be incorporating MMX technology.""
The MMX chip, which is available on desktop PCs as well as on low-power portable computers, contains 4.5 million transistors and adds 57 processor instructions to speed up software instructions.
The added performance of the technology frees up more of the Pentium processor to work on several tasks at once, including low-cost PC videoconferencing over standard telephone lines.
Intel said it planned to build technology to upgrade some of its older Pentium processors later this year.
The company does not expect a re-run of its experiences in 1992, when it was forced to recall hardware because of problems with its processor chips.
""I think we have learnt a lot from that experience,"" Wilson said. ""We're very confident of the quality and reliability of the product we are shipping.""",0
"British telecommunications company Energis said on Friday that its parent, the National Grid electricity transmission network, might sell a majority stake in the company to one or more strategic investors this summer.
The group, which supplies telecoms services to about 14,000 business customers via the Grid's high voltage electricity pylons, also said it was poised to announce a continental deal in a move that will slash the cost of European telephone calls.
Chief executive Mike Grabiner, who moved from the country's dominant phone company British Telecommunications a year ago, said Energis had talked to all global carriers, with the exception of BT, in its search for international partners.
And since the birth of a new cable giant -- Cable and Wireless Communications -- the company is also looking to gain access to key metropolitan areas.
""I think both Energis and the Grid initially see the Grid selling a minority stake in the business,"" Grabiner told Reuters in an interview. But he added: ""For the right mix of partners, I think they could go below 50 percent -- but still maintain a very large strategic and influential interest in the company.""
Energis has been burning a 100 million pound ($168 million) per-year hole in the pocket of the Grid, which was demerged from the 12 regional electricity companies and floated in 1995.
Some analysts say that a significant equity partner in loss-making Energis, that has been valued at more than 600 million pounds, could help inspire the Grid's lacklustre shares.
However, Grabiner said talks with U.S. telecoms giant AT&T were ""not very active"". Some analysts tip the Global One alliance between America's Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom as a potential partner.
Global One has little British access and Energis has already signed a ""correspondent agreement"" with Sprint, America's third international carrier, to end each other's transatlantic calls.
But Energis is keeping its options open. It has also talked to ""selected international strategic investors"". ""(A partner) hasn't got to be a global carrier. It has to be a partner who can support us and add value to the business,"" Grabiner stated.
Energis was set up in 1993 and operates one of the country's most advanced networks by wrapping 4,500 kms of fibre optic cables -- capable of transmitting images and data as well as voice -- around the earthwires between overhead power pylons.
But Energis still has to rely on local operators to originate and end calls.
A five billion pound merger between Cable and Wireless's Mercury unit, NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia and Videotron to create the country's biggest cable group has increased the pressure on Energis to get local access.
To be competitive with BT and Cable and Wireless Communications, Energis is considering linking up with other cable players, local operators or building its own network.
In the meantime, with an international licence safely under its belt, Energis is looking to spark an aggressive price war on European busines telephone routes with an ""imminent"" new correspondent agreement with a major telecom player.
The government broke the BT/Mercury duopoly on owning international calls networks last month, awarding 44 new international licences. Rivals, which used to be forced to lease line capacity from BT and Mercury at high prices, can now buy permament line capacity from others -- and save a lot of money.
""We have a very small market share, a dramatically reduced cost base and every incentive to be aggressive on price to grow our market share. And we will do that,"" Grabiner said.
Last October, Energis offered to undercut BT by about 50 percent with a 10 pence-per-minute charge for selected business customers on direct dialled calls to America. ""European prices have further to go than North American prices,"" Grabiner noted.",0
"The UK telecoms market is one of the world's most competitive and any attempt to block a planned $20 billion merger between British Telecom and U.S. firm MCI on grounds of restricted trade will fail, analysts said on Monday.
The merger partly hinges on how open the UK market is deemed to be because U.S. rules bar foreign groups from buying more than 25 percent of a U.S. firm unless their home market is deemed to be as competitive as that of the United States.
If it is approved, the merger between BT and America's MCI announced on Sunday to create Concert Plc will represent the largest cross-border takeover in history and the world's second biggest international telephone group.
U.S. telecommunications market leader AT&T, which stands to lose most from such a new heavyweight rival, has urged regulatory authorities to give the planned deal with MCI, the number two U.S. carrier, the ""scrutiny it deserves.""
But analysts said it was unrealistic for AT&T, British Telecom's arch-rival in international markets, to say that the British market was not competitive enough.
One industry analyst, asked whether he thought the proposed deal would be cleared, said: ""Ultimately, I think it will be approved. But some tinkering may be required.""
""I don't think it's realistic for AT&T to argue that the market in the UK isn't open -- or that the market in the U.S. is any better,"" said one analyst who declined to be named.
Britain's market is more open than those of its European neighbours, most of which will only abolish state monopolies over telecoms services by January 1, 1998.
The European Commission cleared the BT's acquisition of its initial 20 percent stake in MCI three years ago.
The merger between BT and MCI to form Concert Plc will have to be approved by the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.
Although BT still controls more than 90 percent of all local UK telephone connections, analysts said there were few barriers to foreign companies wanting to compete here.
AT&T is already planning to establish a foothold in the UK market since the international partnership between BT and Cable and Wireless unit Mercury ended earlier this year.
AT&T has also been tipped as likely to forge alliances with UK cable companies in the local market as well as with mobile networks and new operators such as Cambridge-based Ionica.
A spokeswoman for UK telecoms regulator Oftel said it was too early to say which obstacles stood in the way of BT and MCI completing the proposed deal by the end of next year.",0
"Shareholders in Anglo-American conglomerate Hanson Plc Friday overwhelmingly approved the final part of the group's ambitious four-way split-up.
The approval clears the way for its Energy Group division to be spun off on Monday. About 98 percent of shareholders voted for the plan.
The vote ended an era that saw Hanson, under takeover king Lord Hanson and his late partner Lord White, become a star performer in the 1980s as it grew into one of Britain's largest conglomerates.
But with a stock market that showed its mistrust of conglomerates by sharply marking down their shares, Hanson last January announced that it would tear itself up into separate tobacco, chemicals, energy and building companies.
Energy has two main parts, U.S.-Australian Peabody Coal, the world's largest private coal producer, and Eastern, Britain's fourth-largest electricity generator and distribution business.
Analysts said the company has good growth prospects but is difficult to value because of its diversity.
""I genuinely think if there is a chance of growth this is it, but valuing Energy is difficult because it is a very different animal from other utility stocks,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
David Campbell, an analyst at Craig Middleton, said he forecasts earnings growth of around 12 percent annually over the next two years.
Analysts said the potential for using electricity expertise to help Peabody Coal expand in this area in the United States could help Energy's growth.
""Peabody could be the most interesting. It's a clear chance to expand into electricity in the U.S.,"" one said.
Energy has already said it is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and North America and has started talks with a U.S. power marketing company.
The company will join a British electricity sector that has been whittled down by take-overs over the last two years as regional electric companies were bought, leaving just two out of an original twelve created at privatissation in 1990.
There has been some speculation Peabody Coal could be spun off from the British electricity interests, but on Friday, Hanson chairman Lord Hanson ruled this out.
""No, I have had enough of demergers (split-ups) and I think (the two) fit very well together,"" he replied to a shareholder question.
The group, which is expected to start with market value of around 2.8 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) and is being sold with 1.4 billion pounds of debt ($2.3 billion), will be large enough to rank among Britain's biggest blue-chip companies and America's Fortune 500. Shares of the company will be listed in London and New York.
The split-up will give shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held. Every eight shares in the remaining Hanson group will be consolidated into one new share at the same time.
Hanson's first two split-ups, of Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group Plc and U.S.-listed Millennium Chemicals Inc., took place last October.",0
"British Telecommunications (BT) on Friday played down top level talks with Japanese telecoms giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp but analysts refused to rule out that the companies were hatching a deal.
Since the talks were announced on Thursday, speculation has swept the market that BT, which along with its American partner MCI Communications has been openly courting NTT, might be on the brink of a link-up.
But a BT spokesman told Reuters: ""That meeting was of no particular significance. We have regular contacts at that level and will continue to do so with NTT and others.""
While BT is playing its cards close to its chest, some analysts speculated that the company, keen to get a foothold in the lucrative Asian telecoms markets via the world's biggest telecoms player, might hammer out a deal with NTT quite soon.
""I think that they are quite close to it,"" said John Tysoe, telecoms analyst at brokers SocGen Strauss Turnbull. But he added: ""That is just instinct.""
One analyst even said he had made a bet with a colleague that a deal would be signed or announced before the end of February. But others were split.
""You would expect in the next 12-18 months something to happen,"" said Chris McFadden, analyst at Merrill Lynch, adding: ""If it happened tomorrow, we'd be all pleasantly surprised.""
Another said he thought an imminent ""memorandum of understanding"" between the two companies was quite possible. But he added: ""But in terms of any tangible, real tie-up, I would put it later in the year.""
But analysts agree on two things. They dismiss as a ""courtship ritual"" NTT's statement that it might prefer to branch out into the global international market on its own.
They also believe that NTT will want to be calling the shots on any deal.
NTT may even stop short of a straight deal with BT and MCI's Concert alliance, preferring to link up with more than one global alliance. ""On a selected basis, they may link up with as many as possible,"" said one analyst.
At present, there are three main alliances.
Apart from Concert, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and America's Sprint have formed Global One. The third consortium is WorldPartners, a loosely-knit organisation created by U.S. telecoms gaint AT&T.
Members include Unisource, a venture of PTT Telecom of the Netherlands, a Swedish firm, the Swiss service provider, Spain's Telefonica and a stack of Asia-Pacific members such as Hongkong Telecom, Australia's Telstra and Korea Telecom.
BT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield is also travelling to Japan at the end of this month, part of a regular trip where he is likely to meet NTT executives, BT says.
BT has had an office in Japan for 10 years and already has a minor link with one of NTT's units, NTT Data, which distributes its Concert Internet Plus services.
It sent its first regional director to Tokyo this year in a move to highlight the growing importance of the area.",0
"Analysts said on Monday they were expecting UK electronic business information company M.A.I.D Plc to launch new screen-based products that would rival services offered by real-time financial news services.
M.A.I.D declined to comment on a newspaper report that it was working on new online products that would undercut the prices of international news and information group Reuters Holdings Plc and financial news group Bloomberg LP.
The company's executives are on a roadshow in the U.S. for about a week. But a company spokesman said: ""We never comment on market speculation regarding product development.""
The Sunday Times said M.A.I.D was poised to unveil a screen-based real time news service at sharply lower prices than services from Reuters or Bloomberg. Other products could include transmitting financial data to hand-held devices using mobile-telephone technology, the newspaper added.
Analysts had heard a deal was on the cards between MAID and Finnish group Nokia to start a mobile share price service and expected a similar deal with Psion Plc.
Experts said they had also been waiting for Reuters and MAID to launch more similar, rival services.
""I'm totally unsurprised at the article,"" said Keith Woolcock, analyst at Merrill Lynch. ""MAID and Reuters are going to be competing more in the future. Their products are going to become more similar, I think,""
Reuters Business Briefing, the Reuters service against which MAID is expected to compete, offers mainly online business news and share price data at the moment, whereas about 70 percent of MAID's data is market research information.
But analysts expect soon to be able to set up a customised service on MAID systems so that they are alerted to pre-selected requested headlines as stories appear on MAID's news services.
""I know they have been working on that,"" noted one analyst who declined to be named. ""The big deal is having the alerts built in. The key thing about this is what they are going to charge for it in America...
""If they offer this new alert service for free then it's very hot and will make it very hard for anyone to compete."" Analysts expect MAID to tie up a deal with the Financial Times, adding it to French news agency Agence France Presse and U.S. services as well as direct links to other newspapers.
Reuters Business Briefing, meanwhile, is branching out into market research.
Market research group Datamonitor said it has signed a deal with Reuters since ending a similar contract with MAID.

But after reporting robust third quarter profits, helped by ""healthy"" demand for its products and services, BT's chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told reporters, ""We are open minded that these things (mergers) have their pitfalls on culture.""
Commentators have dubbed BT ""staid"" and MCI ""spunky"". But Bonfield said MCI staff he had met so far had been ""amazingly enthusiastic"" about the two companies' planned $20 billion merger, which BT expects European and American regulators to clear by this autumn.
After a 39 million pound ($64 million) charge for redundancies, BT's third quarter pretax profits rose to 909 million pounds ($1.45 billion) from 829 million pounds last time -- towards the upper end of analysts expectations.
BT announced last October that it planned to buy the 80 percent of MCI that it did not already own. The new group, called Concert Plc, aims to service multinational companies end-to-end and be represented in all the world's key nations.
BT also hopes to become the second telecoms operator in continental Europe as key markets are eased open to competition in 1998 and is itching to get into lucrative Asian markets.
BT has one of the most comprehensive network partnerships across Europe, having set up joint ventures in about eight continental European markets worth more than $140 billion.
In a move to boost its German venture, BT announced that Norwegian telecoms operator Telenor had agreed in principle to take a 10 percent stake in VIAG InterKom, the alliance BT has set up with German engineering conglomerate VIAG AG.
Telenor brings with it vital expertise from operating in one of the world's most saturated markets for mobile telephones. Having won a mobile and fixed-line licence in Germany, BT said VIAG InterKom would be the first major telecoms copany to exploit the convergence between the two services.
In December, BT beat arch-rivals Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom by clinching a deal with TeleDanmark in Switzerland's second telecom network Newtelco.
While global telecoms groups jockey for position in a race to secure lucrative services to multinational companies, Japan is seen as the last major frontier.
BT has been wooing Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's biggest telecoms titan, for years.
While NTT takes its time to decide how best to enter the international market, BT's finance director Robert Brace told Reuters that the group did not expect an MCI-type deal in the Asian telecoms markets ""in the next few years"".
""I think we will continue to develop on a global basis as and when the opportunities arrive,"" he said.
Bonfield, who was in Japan last week, said NTT was too big a company to risk linking up with a single company.
""But it may come up with a preferred partner -- and we would like to be that partner,"" he said. BT, which already has a technology agreement with NTT, is keen to use the $150 billion group's lines to sell its Concert services to business clients.
BT's share price, which has surged to new year highs of 450p in the run-up to results, seesawed despite what SocGen's analyst John Tysoe called ""a good, cheerful presentation"".
Tysoe has edged up his full year forecast to a pretax profit of 3.2 billion pounds, largely because of a 50 million pound reduction in the level of expected redundancy charges.
BT saw net cash inflow swell to 4.4 billion pounds in the first nine months and has now got a hefty 211 million pounds of funds on its balance sheet.",0
"Britain on Thursday opened its doors to 44 new international telephone operators, saying it would create a fully open long-distance telecommunications market 12 months ahead of the rest of Europe.
U.S. telecoms giant AT&T, Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel and the Global One alliance between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Sprint are now among those free to compete against dominant players British Telecommunications (BT) and Mercury.
While the rest of Europe is only aiming for telecom liberalisation in 1998, a rash of new rivals -- mainly from the United States -- will be able to offer a full range of telecoms services between Britain and the rest of the world from January 1, 1997.
""The UK has proved to the world that liberalisation pushes down prices and improves services,"" Science and Technology Minister Ian Taylor said in a statement.
""Phone prices are down 40 percent overall since 1984, and I expect these new licensees to put further downward pressure on international rates,"" added Taylor, who is keen for a more open telecommunications market to attract inward investment.
In the largest single move towards opening up the international telecom market, which BT values at just under 2.0 billion pounds ($3.33 billion), 46 companies applied for licences in July, 44 of which have now been granted.
Until now, international rivals to BT and Mercury -- which is owned by Britain's second largest telecoms operator Cable and Wireless -- have only been able to operate by paying to lease lines from two British companies.
But own-facilities services are cheaper to provide.
The move may also help dampen opposition by AT&T, America's largest long-distance carrier, to BT's proposed $20 billion merger with America's MCI Communications Corp.
Regulatory clearance hinges on how open the authorities deem Britain's telecom market is. With BT keen to take on the U.S., the world's largest telecoms market -- worth about $200 billion -- regulators are keen to ensure that the same competitive benefits are available to U.S. companies.
BT welcomed its new rivals, adding that it was hopeful of winning approval for its U.S. mega-merger. ""This (move) indicates how open the UK market is,"" a spokesman said.
Analysts say that expectations of growing competition and the inevitable falling margins at home have already been discounted in telecom companies' share prices.
""This has been very well flagged,"" noted one.
Mobile telephone operator Vodafone Group, having clinched its licence, jumped 6.5 pence to 246.5p.
BT's shares rose four pence to 397p and Cable and Wireless' stock added 1/2p 474.5 pence by early afternoon.
Analysts have found it hard to predict how hard revenues will be hit by BT and Mercury's loss of market share as telecoms companies turn their attention overseas to help boost earnings.
But Cable and Wireless' Mercury is expected to suffer more than BT because international traffic makes up a much higher proportion of traffic -- and thus contributes a higher proportion of profits.",0
"British Telecom unveiled the largest merger in Britain's corporate history on Sunday, linking up with MCI Communications, the number two U.S. long-distance phone company, to create a $54 billion group.
Six months after alliance talks failed with BT's British rival Cable and Wireless, BT announced that its deal with MCI, to be called Concert Plc, would create one of the world's largest telecoms groups with 43 million business and residential customers in 70 countries.
BT already owned 20 percent of MCI with which it has created the Concert joint venture, providing a whole range of communications services to customers in more than 50 nations.
""The merger combines the substantial financial resources and global position of BT with the growth momentum and market expertise of MCI, known for its success in the competitive U.S. long distance market,"" BT said in a statement.
Under the deal, which has yet to be agreed by regulatory authorities on either side of the Atlantic, shareholders in MCI would receive up to $3.8 billion in cash as well as 0.54 new Concert American Depositary Shares for every MCI share held.
Under the proposed deal, BT is paying its shareholders a special dividend bonanza of 35 pence a per share, worth an estimated two billion pounds.
BT did not immediately give figures for the total value of the proposed deal, details of which started leaking into the markets late on Friday.
Analysts expect the deal to be worth about $22 billion.
The new telecoms giant, incorporated in Britain, would have headquarters in London and Washington and operate under the BT and MCI brand names.
BT has been looking for a major acquisition since its proposed merger with British rival Cable and Wireless failed in May. BT had been keen to forge that deal because it would have given it access to the lucrative Asian telecoms market -- the world's fastest growing market.
Analysts now expect BT and MCI to start making overtures to major Asian players such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp, the world's largest telecoms group. The company said in a statement that the proposed deal would create a world leading communications power house with annual cash flow of about 7.5 billion pounds.
BT expects the merger would yield savings from combining overlapping services of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) over the first five years and 500 million pounds per year before tax after that.
BT also forecast dividends of 19.85 pence per share for the year to March 31, 1997 -- a rise of six percent over last year -- excluding the 35p per share special dividend.
BT, which will release full year results on November 14, has declared a half year dividend of 7.90 pence payable in November, six percent more than in the same period last year.
The deal is believed to be the second largest ever involving a U.S. company -- topped only by the 1989 buyout of RJR Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co.
Analysts said a combined company would be a good fit in the ultra-competitive U.S. long-distance phone industry, where MCI's major competitors are AT&T Corp and Sprint.
Current market leader AT&T, which would be the hardest hit by a fiancially muscular new enlarged rival, said on Friday it was confident any MCI/BT deal would receive proper scrutiny by the U.S. government.",0
"Institutional investors in British utility Northern Electric said on Friday they were likely to sell up if told to do so by the company, despite their objections to the price offered in U.S. group CE Electric's winning bid.
Northern Electric, which operates in northeast England, was poised to announce whether it would officially concede defeat and recommend the 782 million pound ($1.3 billion), or 650p- per-share, hostile offer by the U.S.-controlled energy group.
""There will be a statement from us in the next 72 hours or so,"" a company spokesman told Reuters.
Institutions said they were awaiting Northern's response after CE Electric on Tuesday declared its bid unconditional having secured a slim 50.3 percent majority of acceptances.
""We thought that the price offered was too low and I think now it is a question of getting Northern's judgement on it and making up our minds,"" said a fund manager at one institution who declined to be named. ""But we would have to give a lot of thought to being a minority shareholder,"" he added.
Another institutional investor also said it was unlikely to keep its stake. ""I doubt if we would be standing aside. (Selling) would be our normal procedure,"" said a spokesman.
In normal circumstances, a firm recommends even a hostile offer after the bid has been declared unconditional.
But there has been little about CE Electric's fight for Northern that has been normal -- and at least one institution admitted to harbouring a slim hope Northern could still pull something out of the hat.
Northern Electric, which last year became the only one of the 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) to fight off a hostile bid, lost the battle after an unprecendented extension to the bid tipped the votes in CE Electric's favour.
The Prudential Corp, one of Northern's biggest shareholders, then attempted to defeat the takeover in the eleventh hour by trying to persuade investors who had accepted the offer to sell their Northern shares to the insurer instead for the same price.
CE Electric is keen to win at least 90 percent of the shares -- the amount needed under British takeover rules before it can carry out a compulsory purchase of the remaining ones -- and its message to any institutions thinking about hanging on to minority stakes was terse.
""If these reports about some shareholders deciding that they will not accept the offer are true, it raises a number of questions about their investment policy. But obviously it is up to them to decide what they want to do,"" a CalEnergy spokesman.
While Northern's core business is heavily regulated, most institutions invest in utilities for their robust dividends -- which is a matter for the board, not the industry regulator.
Some institutions said they remained baffled that Northern's bid for independence had failed because of a technicality.
The Takeover Panel last Friday extended the bid, after CE Electric narrowly failed to win control, because Northern's broker BZW had belatedly reported it had charged Northern an extra 250,000 pounds in a performance-related fee.
One institution said on Friday it remained convined that Northern was worth 700-720 pence a share, saying that if CE's bid had failed, the U.S. group may have come back to discuss a higher price -- or a fresh bidder could have been attracted.
Failing that, the value of the company would have been reflected in its share price in the long term, it said.
Only two of 12 regional electricity companies now remain independent -- Southern Electric and Yorkshire Electricity. Six have been bid for by American companies.",0
"British Telecommications beat even the most optimistic analyst forecasts on Thursday with robust second quarter and first half profits and insisted it was growing despite ever stiffer competition.
BT, which plans to merge with America's MCI to create Concert, one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, said profits before tax, redundancy and restructuring charges rose 7.4 percent in the quarter and 5.2 percent in the first half.
But after a hefty 235 million pound ($388.2 million) of redundancy costs and a 60 million pound charge for the repurchase of government-held bonds, half year pretax profits came in at 1.6 billion pounds and 730 million pounds in the second quarter -- slightly below the corresponding 1995 figures.
BT, whose shares were 8.5 pence higher at 369p in heavy trade after a high on the day of 371, managed to hang onto its 20.5 million residential customer lines despite predictions that competition from cable companies would dent its market share.
""We're growing, we're not going backwards,"" finance director Robert Brace told Reuters in an interview, noting that turnover in the six months rose 4.5 percent to 7.37 billion pounds.
""I think telecoms is one of the most exciting growth industries in the world,"" he said. ""When we open (the markets) up, drop the prices, raise the quality of service, and really market hard, the growth levels are double digit.""
The group also said its biggest business, inland calls, grew one percent to over seven percent in the quarter on a 12 month moving average basis after price cuts and marketing initiatives.
But chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield told a news conference BT was probably losing one to two percentage points of a growing British telecoms market, and that this trend was likely to continue, forcing BT to turn abroad for profit growth.
""BT will lose profits in the short term,"" said James Ross, telecoms analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, who expects BT to post a full year pretax profit of 2.1 billion pounds. But he said BT was well placed to fight competition at home and abroad.
""They are the group that has done the best (abroad) so far and in the UK, they have protected their position,"" he said.
Brace said BT planned to ""get very aggressive"" in the next two years as European telecoms markets are opened around 1998.
BT expects to win more than 30 percent of revenues from its six continental European joint ventures after liberalisation. Those ventures, worth about $135 billion, could start contributing profits after five to seven years, Bonfield said.
The group plans to take a substantial market share of the lucrative big business, data and mobile services markets.
Bonfield said BT, which expects 1996/97 capital expenditure to be around 2.7-2.8 billion pounds, still saw a link-up with a partner such as Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone a high, long-term priority for a ticket into booming Asia.
""I'd really hate to be knocked out by another competitor just because we weren't treading the boards,"" he said.
While Japan was mulling the future structure of NTT, BT would make sure it was ""parading outside the door"", he said.
BT operates in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. Another 3,200 staff left in the first half of this year with about 3,000 more voluntary redundancies expected this year.
Asked whether BT planned similar deals to its $20 billion MCI merger, Brace said: ""I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with,"" he said.",0
"Virginia-based Dominion Resources executives Tuesday began merger talks with British utility East Midlands Electricity in an effort to agree on a takeover price.
Dominion's chairman, chief finance officer and attorneys began meeting in London with East Midlands Chairman Nigel Rudd, Chief Executive Norman Askew and their advisers -- the merchant bank Schroders -- a source close to the British regional electric company said.
No further details were immediately available.
Richmond, Va.-based Dominion Resources owns Virginia Power.
Dominion and East Midlands agreed to talk despite East Midlands' insistence it would reject any offer from Dominion Resources pitched at around 6.08 pounds sterling per share ($10.05), which would value the British company at 1.2 billion pounds ($2 billion).
In the fifth potential U.S. bid for one of Britain's 12 cash-rich regional electricity companies, Dominion said last week that it was considering an offer ""at a price not much in excess of 608 pence per share.""
But East Midlands, the first of its wealthy peers to launch a stock buy-back in an attempt to redistribute cash to shareholders, scorned the price as undervaluing the Nottingham-based utility's prospects.
East Midlands, the target of consistent bid speculation as seven of 12 regional electricity companies have fallen to predators and an eighth, Northern Electric, is facing its second hostile bid, saw its stock end 8.5 pence (14 cents) higher at 6.12 pounds ($10.12).
Dominion's stock closed up 12.5 cents at $39.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Some traders and analysts said the London market remained unconvinced the American utility would launch a bid.
Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at the Yamaichi brokerage, said Dominion would need to start merger talks at 650 pence ($10.74) per share, but added East Midlands was unlikely to recommend a bid much below 7 pounds, or 700 pence ($11.57).
""I do not believe East Midlands would recommend a bid siginficantly below 700p per share,"" he said. ""I am not saying they would refuse it at the 690p ($11.40) level.""
Traders also emphasised that Dominion could still walk away from the talks amid regulatory and political uncertainties.
A Dominion Resources spokesman has said the U.S. company was well aware of the uncertainties that surround the purchase of a British electrical utility.
A lull in a wave of bids for electric companies came to an abrupt halt last month when CE Electric -- jointly owned by CalEnergy Co. and Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. -- launched a hostile 650 million-pound ($1.07 billion) bid for Northern Electric.
The Nebraska-based utility has built up a stake of around 29.5 percent in a series of market raids on Northern Electric, which became the first regional electric company to be faced with a takevoer attempt in December 1994.
A costly shareholder package in defence against the unwanted attentions of conglomerate Trafalgar House left Northern Electric with high debts.",0
"LONDON - Shares in British Telecommunications (BT) surged on both sides of the Atlantic on Monday as traders furiously dealt the stock higher in the wake of a $20 billion mega-merger with America's second biggest carrier, MCI Communications.
Analysts said the deal with MCI, which turns the BT/MCI combine into the world's second largest international telephone group with annual revenues of over 25 billion pounds ($41 billion), was mainly welcomed because it would force BT to become more capital efficient by increasing its borrowing.
Weekend news of the biggest transatlantic deal in history, linking Britain's dominant telecoms company with a major American player, also prompted some analysts to reassess BT's growth prospects.
Just under 82.5 million BT shares exchanged hands in London on Monday and the stock ended a sharp 22.5 pence higher at 373.5 pence, having touched 392 pence during trade.
Some analysts recommended buying BT shares up to 400 pence on the back of the tremendous growth prosepects in the telecoms market, one of the world's most rapidly changing industries.
The deal, which creates the world's fourth largest telecoms group in terms of sales after Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT), America's AT&T and Germany's Deutsche Telekom also allows BT to limit its dependence on the heavily regulated British telecoms market.
""This deal will force people to look at BT in a new light; look at the international operations, look at the international alliances in Europe, look at what they could be doing with the Internet because MCI is a big player there,"" said one analyst who asked not to be named.
""All these much higher growth and much more exciting elements of BT in which the company has been quietly building value will come much more to the fore,"" he added, noting that he was pitching the stock's value at nearer 430 pence.
The merger, which was sweetened with a 2.2 billion pound special dividend for BT shareholders, helps lift the company's debt-to-equity ratio, or gearing, to 65 percent from under five percent.
Analysts have been valuing BT, which had a market value of about 22.6 billion pounds before the MCI deal was announced on Sunday, as a British utility that had about 60 percent of its revenues governed by a regulatory price cap.
But having lined up six European joint-ventures, BT's share of the population in Europe alone for which it may win a licence could rise to 90 million. Armed with MCI, it also hopes to be better placed to win market share in Asia -- possibly with NTT.
""In one year's time, only 15 percent of BT's revenues will be covered by a price cap. And, with their European operations getting off the ground, they will have a very substantial business in international markets,"" said one analyst.
BT and MCI's alliance, dubbed Concert Plc, still needs to win regulatory clearance in both America and Britain.
Britain's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said that it was still unclear whether the merger, which BT believes will be cleared in about 12 months, would fall under its remit for clearance or under that of the European Commission.
One of the issues that determines which regulatory authority rules on the merger will be the turnover of the new company. However, any EC decision would be made in conjunction with advice from Oftel, the British telecoms regulator, and the DTI.
Most analysts believe that while there are hurdles to the deal, the merger is likely to be shown the green light.",0
"Scotland-based hotels and casinos group Stakis on Thursday said it will buy Lonrho Plc's five Metropole hotels, funding the 327 million pound ($530 million) deal with a huge cash call on shareholders.
Stakis, which operates 46 British hotels and 22 casinos -- and whose current market value is only about 472 million pounds -- said it wanted to raise 222 million pounds via a heavyweight four-for-seven rights issue, set at 82 pence per share.
""We've found a reasonable and sensible price for a very good, perhaps unique, product,"" Stakis chief executive David Michels told a news conference.
Lonrho, which is in the throes of a demerger, said in a separate statement that the disposal would generate net proceeds of 316 million pounds as well as payments of 63 million pounds in dividends and tax relief that it will receive from the chain.
""The proposed sale of Metropole Hotels represents an important step in the separation of Lonrho's mining and non-mining assets...,"" said Lonrho chairman John Leahy, adding that the firm was continuing to make progress with its demerger.
Last month, Lonrho shelved plans for a 700 million pound flotation of its Metropole and its North American-based Princess luxury resort hotels because of the level of interest it had received from potential buyers.
Saudi billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal has been tipped as the most likely buyer of the 10 five-star Princess hotels. Lonrho expects to announce the sale in about three weeks.
The sale of the hotels, which will be followed by the divestment of the group's African trading operations, is part of Lonrho's plans to turn itself into a focused mining company and ends 30 years of empire building by founder Tiny Rowland.
Stakis had been the front-runner to buy the conglomerate's Metropole chain -- four-star hotels with extensive conference facilities -- since rival Millennium & Copthorne Hotels pulled out of the bidding race earlier this month.
The hotels group said it expected the acquisition to boost earnings from the first year and forecast 1996 group profit before tax and exceptionals would be over 30.6 million pounds.
Stakis also forecast a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share, giving a total payout of 2.15 pence for the full year -- 23 percent more than last year.
The company, which had been in acquisition talks with Lonrho for about 15 months, plans to cut costs at the hotels and boost profits by boosting occupancy -- currently at about 68 percent.
Analysts welcomed the deal. ""The numbers stack up. I have no problem with their strategy,"" said Matthew Nayler, leisure analyst at brokers Williams de Broe.
Analysts estimate that Stakis will have to boost profits at the hotels -- in the cities of London and Birmingham and the seaside resorts of Brighton and Blackpool -- by at least 12 percent for the purchase to be profitable.
In an innovative move by investment bank Schroders that will save Stakis some money on commissions, the bank is arranging a partial tender for sub-underwriting of the rights issue by investment institutions in which sub-underwriters will be allowed to tender at lower commissions for additional sub- underwriting above their initial allocations.
Schroders will then cut the primary underwriting commission charged to Stakis at the same rate as any reduction in total sub-underwriting charges.
""We may lose money but we think change (to commission rates) is inevitable,"" Schroders' Robert Swannell told reporters.
The market is now awaiting news on Lonrho's sale of the Princess hotels, which include resorts in Acapulco, Mexico, the Caribbean and the U.S.
A Lonrho spokesman said news on this was expected in approximately three weeks.
Financial sources in the Gulf said earlier this month that the Saudi prince had exclusive rights to negotiate a deal and that the price was $300 million. The prince's key western investments include stakes in New York's luxury Plaza hotel, the Four Seasons hotel group, banking group Citicorp and the Disneyland Paris theme park.",0
"British Telecommuncations Plc, the telecoms giant, beat even the most optimistic analyst forecasts on Thursday with robust second quarter and first half profits and insisted it was growing despite ever stiffer competition.
BT, which plans to merge with America's MCI to create one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, said profits before tax, redundancy and restructuring charges rose 7.4 percent in the second quarter and 5.2 percent in the first half.
But after a hefty 235 million pound ($388.2 million) redundancy charge and a 60 million pound charge for the repurchase of government-held bonds, half year pretax profits came in at 1.6 billion pounds and 730 million pounds in the second quarter -- slightly below figures for the same periods in 1995.
""The results for the half year show an encouraging position with sustained high growth in demand for our telephony services and significant sales increases in our new markets and advanced products,"" said chairman Sir Iain Vallance.
BT, whose shares jumped 8.5 pence to 369 pence in heavy trade, has managed to hang onto its 20.5 million residential customer lines over the last 12 months despite predictions that competition from cable companies would dent its market share.
The group also said its biggest business, inland calls, grew one percent to over seven percent in the quarter on a 12 month moving average basis after price cuts and marketing initiatives.
""We're growing, we're not going backwards,"" finance director Robert Brace told Reuters in an interview, noting that turnover in the six months rose 4.5 percent to 7.37 billion pounds.
""I think telecoms is one of the most exciting growth industries in the world...When we open (the markets) up, drop the prices, raise the quality of service and really market hard, the growth levels are double digit.""
BT, which has formed six joint ventures worth $135 billion to gain access to the European markets, said it planned to ""get very aggressive"" in the next two years as the continental telecoms markets are opened up to competition, around 1998.
Asked where BT saw the main profit growth, Brace said:
""All prices in France and Germany are very high compared with the UK. If markets open up and we compete, prices will come down. But we will take substantial market share, particularly in the business area where quality of service really matters.""
BT has operations in 30 countries and employs about 130,000 staff worldwide. Since privatisation in 1984, about 110,000 jobs have gone. The firm, which cut another 3,200 staff in the first half of this year, expects about the same number of voluntary redundancies in the second.
As part of its European offensive, BT has won a licence in the Netherlands, plans to win both fixed and mobile licences in Germany and has bought into a mobile licence in France where it also thinks it will win the second fixed licence.
Brace said high-speed digital ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) lines and overseas operations were growing at about 50-100 percent per year and that the company had high hopes for its intranet initiative with software giant Microsoft Corp, where it also sees booming demand.
BT said on Wednesday that it and MCI, whose proposed merger is the biggest transatlantic deal in history, were linking up with Microsoft to offer transnational firms private communications networks based on the internet.
Asked whether BT, which announced its $20 billion merger with MCI on November 3, planned similar deals, Brace said few other large communications groups offered the same prospects.
""I'm not sure that there are similar deals as MCI -- because there aren't many companies that size in the world one would wish to merge with.""
As previously announced, BT is raising its interim dividend by six percent to 7.9 pence. As part of the MCI deal, BT is also paying a special dividend of 35 pence which it expects to pay in September 1997 at the same time as the final dividend.",0
"Britain's largest home loan lender, Halifax Building Society, said on Thursday it was confident of avoiding any takeover attempt when it floats on the stock market and sheds mutuality for bank status next June.
""We think we can stand on our own feet,"" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said.
The society, currently owned by its savers and borrowers, gave details of the timetable for conversion and flotation, which analysts have said could be worth 10 billion pounds ($16 billion).
The building society's nine million members will vote early next year on the conversion, which it is billing as the largest single extension of private share ownership in Britain.
Gilchrist said a decision to transfer its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose five-year protection against takeover but underlined its confidence.
Analysts said the consolidation of Britain's financial services market is likely to continue, which could make the large and successful Halifax a possible target.
The flotation will project the society into the top 25 companies in London's blue chip FTSE 100 stock index and Gilchrist said he was confident that shareholders would be convinced by its past performance to reject any bid attempt.
The concersion method raises the voting threshold needed for the plans to go ahead, but Gilchrist said he believed the necessary 50 percent of investing members entitled to vote would be met.
""We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,"" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.
""It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,"" Gilchrist said.
But members eagerly expecting to find out how big a windfall they are likely to receive when they receive free shares will have to wait until January before getting any indication.
The Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to and indicate their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions.
Gilchrist said members would get a ""broad idea"" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.
He also declined to comment on the cost of the conversion exercise. But it seems likely to provide a boon to Britain's postal service and the printing industry as well as the financial and legal advisors working on the plans.
""The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,"" he said.
Halifax members will be urged to vote ""as quickly as possible"" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.
Gilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.
""We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,"" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.
The society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 pounds in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.",0
"UK investment capital group 3i Group Plc said on Thursday the increase in its first half net asset value (NAV) per share was healthy but had been partly held back by continental Europe and a strong pound.
""Its a pretty healthy increase. Its held back a bit by continental Europe...the markets have not been that good and there has also been the appreciation of sterling,"" Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive told Reuters.
3i's NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence for the same period the previous year.  
Macpherson said a better indication of the group's performance was its UK portfolio which had performed ""extremely well"", reflected in an 18 percent growth in revenue.
He said there were still plenty of opportunities available, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well. There had also been an improvement in general business confidence in the UK, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter according to 3i's latest survey.
""The confidence in the businesses underlying our portfolio has been so positive,"" he said. Of 327.3 million stg invested by 3i during the period, 284.2 million stg was in the UK.  
Macpherson said the prospect of a general election in the UK, which must be held by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their holdings in a firm while there was no doubt about the tax implications.
While the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said, adding that current pricing levels for the small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were ""very attractive"".  
During the first half of the year, 3i said, realisations on investments had continued ""at an encouraging rate"". It realised investments of 122.2 million stg in the UK and 35.9 million stg in continental Europe.
Macpherson said the group had ""significant plans to expand in Europe"" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in Dusseldorf, Germany in January. This regionalisation would involve opening offices in Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart.
And the group was also planning to extend its presence into the south of France, he added.  
The group also announced it would open its first office in South East Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997.
Macpherson said the area was ""an exciting part of the world"" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered.
He said the office would start small, with a staff of three, and would have a maximum of ""half-a-dozen"" people for the first year or so and would look at opportunities in Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia but not in China.",0
"Britain's largest cable television company was born Tuesday in the merger of the British operations of cable and telecommunications giants Cable & Wireless, NYNEX Corp. of the United States and Bell Canada International.
The deal, which took only five weeks to complete, brings together C&W's Mercury, British cable company Videotron, Bell Cablemedia and NYNEX CableComms, eclipsing Telewest as Britain's biggest cable operator.
It was a landmark deal for C&W Chief Executive Richard Brown, appointed five months ago, and follows the collapse of merger talks earlier this year between C&W and its great rival, British Telecommunications Plc.
C&W last month replaced BT in a major German alliance with diversified utility RWE that is seen as the main competitor to the dominant Deutsche Telekom as the German market is being liberalised.
Brown said the merged company, which will provide integrated telecommunications, information and entertainment services, would give C&W's Mercury telephone company access to a total of 18 million business and domestic customers.
Latest statistics show 30 percent of homes that can take cable after an extensive cable-laying drive beneath Britain's streets have opted for one or more cable service.
The development was welcomed by the industry, battling to compete with satellite operators such as BSkyB in television services and British Telecom in telephones.
""This is clear evidence of confidence in the future of the U.K. cable industry,"" said a spokesman for the Cable Communications Association, an industry group.
""The broadband fibre optic network being laid across the U.K. is the most advanced in the world for delivery to individual homes,"" he said, adding that around 6 billion pounds ($7.5 billion) had already been invested in building the network and another six billion of investment was planned.
In a related deal, Videotron is being bought by Bell Cablemedia in a complex transaction involving a $338 million equity investment in Bell Cablemedia by Cable & Wireless. This values Videotron at around $1.09 billion.
Once the merger and the Videotron deal have been completed, Cable & Wireless will own 52.6 percent of the new company -- to be called Cable & Wireless Communications -- with NYNEX owning 18.5 percent and Bell Canada 14.2 percent of the shares.
The remaining 15 percent will floated and the groups intend to list the company in both London and New York. This is likely to take place in about six months.
""Cable & Wireless Communications will be the only company in the U.K. capable of offering a combination of telecoms, broadband, data transmission, video shopping and Internet access,"" Brown said.
Stephen Pettit, executive director of European operations at C&W, told Reuters Financial Television that the deal would not lead to duplication.
""Both Mercury and the cable companies had strategies to dig up the streets and lay cables and they are looking at the same streets. This gives the chance to do it once and keep the costs down as a result,"" he said.",0
"British property company Greycoat is unlikely to crumble under pressure from rebel shareholders who want it broken up or succumb to a merger approach from smaller rival Moorfield Estates, analysts said on Monday.
""I don't think they are on the critical list in any sense or meaning of the word,"" one analyst said.
A proposal to sell-off Greycoat's assets is due to be put to shareholders at a special meeting on Thursday. It has been put forward by the UK Active Value Fund, which is advised by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson's Active Value Advisers.
UK Active Value Fund bought its 11 percent stake in Greycoat three years ago, rescuing it from receivership. But Myerson's relationship with the firm's management has not run smoothly.
The South African financier's challenge to the Greycoat management has also triggered a proposal by Moorfield Estates involving a share exchange offer for the larger Greycoat, which has so far dismissed the approach.
Moorfield said in a statement on Monday that it had ""developed a proposal to add value for all shareholders through a strategy of more active management of the assets of Greycoat"".
It said this had been presented to some of Greycoat's larger shareholders, accounting for close to 40 percent of the shares, and an approach had then been made to Greycoat's chairman.
They include merging the two companies by a share exchange and restructuring the assets of the enlarged group.
This would involve a Central London portfolio made up initially of Greycoat's main assets, Embankment Place and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, which would later be demerged.
Moorfield also intends setting up a portfolio of ""investment and development property earmarked for immediate disposal to a major property company"".
The remainder of the enlarged group would constitute ""an investment, trading and development portfolio"" and there would be a reorganisation of the management structure to reduce costs by ""at least 1.5 million pounds ($2.47 million) per annum"", Moorfield said.
While analysts agreed the Moorfield plan was unlikely to succeed, some said there was an opportunity for Greycoat to take over another company with higher profitability so the combined company could capitalise on Greycoat's favourable tax position.
""But they are not going to be flushed out by Thursday,"" a second property analyst told Reuters, adding that three or four companies had looked ""very seriously"" at the possibility of joining with Greycoat.
Another possibility would be a larger group such as British Land sweeping up Greycoat, although such an outcome seems remote in the short-term, analysts said.
Myerson's proposed sale of Greycoat's London property assets is seen by some as an unwise ""forced sale"" which would not achieve shareholder value in what is an improving market.
""Generally speaking a forced sale of their assets would not gain anything in the short term,"" the first analyst said, adding that with rental growth starting to show through, it made sense to hold onto Greycoat's two largest properties.
""They are vulnerable to any change in market conditions, but it would be a mistake to be forced into a corner and to sell something in a relatively short timescale. It would be totally counterproductive,"" he added.
But others said the time was right to sell off Greycoat's largest assets. ""This is exactly the right time of the cycle (to sell,"" the second analyst said.",0
"British merchant bank Hambros, under fire from a rebel Hong Kong shareholder calling for its breakup, reported a return to first-half profit on Wednesday and said the benefits of restructuring should begin to show through.
""We have great confidence in ourselves and what we are trying to do,"" Sir Chips Keswick, the group's chief executive, said in an interview.
He dismissed efforts by Hong Kong investment manager Regent Pacific Group, which holds three percent of Hambros, to break up the firm in an attempt to realise shareholder value.
""Regent is a three percent shareholder and is perfectly entitled to (its) views. We are perfectly entitled not to share them,"" Keswick said.
Hambros reported pretax profits of 35.0 million pounds ($57.81 million) for the first half, compared with a 7.7 million pound loss for the same period in 1995.
Some analysts had forecast pretax profits of up to 45.0 million pounds based on a strong performance by Hambros' estate agent subsidiary Hambro Countrywide.
They also predicted an interim dividend range of between 2.5 and 3.0 pence. In the event the dividend was unchanged at 2.5 pence.
Hambros is among a dwindling list of British investment banks which are the constant subject of takeover speculation. However, it has been seen as one of the less attractive targets due to recent poor performance and major provisions for bad debts.
Bad debt provisions for the period were 5.9 million pounds compared with 23.5 million in the same period in 1995.
Asked about the possibility of Hambros becomin a takeover target for a larger international player, Keswick said a public company was always in the firing line but he was happy with the group's direction.
While he could not talk for shareholders in the group, Keswick said he had the impression from discussions with them in the wake of the Regent Pacific move that they were supportive of changes the company had implemented.
Keswick said the group was on track to replace ""low margin vanilla business"" with increased return per customer business. It had decided the best strategy was to undergo major upheavals for a year rather than piecemeal changes over a longer period in order to achieve this.
Keswick, who forecast the benefits of the changes could take a year or two to come through, said he was pleased the group had moved back into profit, adding that the Investment Group's result had been particularly good.
But Hambros chairman Lord Hambro warned that profits from this part of the business were not expected to match the first half in the rest of the year.
However, he expected ""considerable improvement"" from Hambros' subsidiaries and, despite a challenging environment for the group as a whole, prospects were good.
Lord Hambro said he would retire from his post in July 1997 and be succeeded by Keswick.",0
"British venture capital firm 3i Group Plc on Thursday reported a rise in first half net asset value (NAV) per share and revenue profits but said it had been held back by continental Europe and a strong pound.
3i's NAV for the period rose to 454 pence per share, from 426 pence in the first half last year, while profit before tax rose to 62.9 million pounds ($106 million) from 54.3 million.
""Its a pretty healthy increase. Its held back a bit by continental Europe...the markets have not been that good and there has also been the appreciation of sterling,"" Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive said in an interview.
Macpherson said a better indication of the group's performance was its British portfolio which had performed ""extremely well"", reflected in an 18 percent growth in revenue.
There were still plenty of opportunities available, he said, with the sort of companies that 3i invested in doing very well.
There had also been an improvement in general business confidence in Britain, which had improved for the fourth consecutive quarter, according to 3i's latest ""Enterprise Barometer"" survey.
Of 327 million pounds invested by 3i during the period, 284 million was in Britain.
Macpherson said the prospect of a general election in Britain by May 1997, had resulted in a number of investment opportunities for 3i as some company founders or management teams decided to sell their corporate holdings while the tax regime remained clear.
While the European performance had an impact on the NAV figure, the investment opportunities for 3i on the continent remained good, Macpherson said. Current pricing levels for small and medium-sized European companies in which the group invests were ""very attractive"".
During the first half of the year, realisation of investments continued at an encouraging rate, with sales worth 122 million pounds in Britain and some 36 million pounds in continental Europe.
Macpherson said the group had ""significant plans to expand in Europe"" and this was reflected in its decision to open an office in the German city of Duesseldorf in January.
This regionalisation would also involve opening offices in three other German cities -- Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart -- and the group also plans to extend its presence into the south of France.
The group said it wanted to open its first office in Southeast Asia, in Singapore, early in 1997.
Macpherson said Asia was ""an exciting part of the world"" for investment capital and Singapore had been chosen as it was a good communication centre from which other parts of the region could be covered.",0
"Britain's Halifax Building Society is confident of avoiding any takeover attempts once it sheds its mutual status and becomes a publicly quoted bank in June next year, a senior official said on Thursday.
""We think we can stand on our own feet,"" David Gilchrist, Halifax's director of corporate affairs said in a telephone interview following the announcement of the timetable for the planned conversion and 10 billion stg flotation.
The building society's nine million members -- its savers and borrowers -- will vote on the conversion early next year.  
Gilchrist said the building society's decision to convert by transferring its business to an existing subsidiary rather than to a company specially formed for conversion meant it would lose a five-year protection against takeover.
It will also increase the voting threshold needed to give the plans the go-ahead. But he was confident that it would achieve a sufficiently high vote in favour, of at least 50 percent of all investing members entitled to vote.
""We have no real concerns as far as the voting is concerned,"" he said, adding that previous building society conversions achieved approvals of over 75 percent.  
""It will be a high-profile exercise, backed up by plenty of marketing,"" Gilchrist said.
Earlier, the Halifax said its members would be given full details of the conversion plans and share distribution scheme in January 1997. This will tell them the number of shares they are entitled to receive and an indication of their likely price range, based on prevailing market conditions at the time.
Gilchrist said members would get a ""broad idea"" at this time, but would not be drawn on what the share hand-out was likely to be worth to the average investor.  
He also declined to comment on what the cost of the conversion exercise would be, saying only that a significant element would be printing and postage costs.
""The major element of cost is printing and mailing. We will be sending 75 million items of mail,"" he said.
Halifax members will be urged to vote ""as quickly as possible"" on the proposals and a special general meeting will be held in Sheffield in February. If members vote in favour, they will be sent details of share allocations in April or May.
Gilchrist said the Halifax had not yet done any market research on how many members would sell or retain shares.  
""We are not trying to persuade people one way or another whether to hold shares or to sell the shares,"" he said, adding the Halifax would sound out members nearer the time.
But it was working on the basis that a ""large number"" would have already planned to spend their windfall and had set up a share dealing system to ensure an orderly market for what will be the largest single extension of private share ownership ever in Britain, Gilchrist added.
Those who decide to sell will be offered a free-of-charge postal service for a limited period while those who keep them can chose between placing them in a nominee company or receiving a share certificate. The Halifax favours the nominee option.
The society will remind its members that they should have at least 100 stg in total in their accounts on December 31 1996.
If eligible for a variable distribution of extra free shares they ""may need to top up their share accounts to the November 25 1994 level by the date of the special general meeting"" to qualify for the maximum number of free shares, the Halifax said.",0
"Singapore's Hotel Properties and property group Canary Wharf on Friday applied for detailed planning consent for a development aimed at injecting life into an office-dominated area of London's former docks.
""Life means people who stay here. We looked at what was lacking (in Canary Wharf) and that was life,"" Thio Gim Hock, executive director of HPL, told Reuters in an interview.
HPL and Canary Wharf, which is owned by an international consortium led by Paul Reichmann and including Prince Al Waleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud of Saudi Arabia, formed an 80-20 joint venture for the residential, hotel and leisure project.
The multi-million pound scheme represents the first phase of development of an 11-acre (4.5 hectare) site adjoining the River Thames. It will be part of the landmark Canary Wharf docklands development to the east of the City financial district, home to Britain's tallest building.
The development will be the first at the massive Canary Wharf site since an agreement last year by banks to sell out to the Reichmann-led consortium. The banks had taken over the ownership when the original development company went into administration.
Despite these problems, 80 percent of the offices have now been occupied and Canary Wharf is vying with the London's traditional financial heartland as a site for large global investment banks to locate their new headquarters.
Office blocks have so far dominated the site, however, and Thio Gim Hock said he expects to start building 330 residential units, a five star hotel and sports club early in 1997. They are due to be completed by the end of 1998 or early 1999.
There is already outline planning permission from the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) to develop the site and Canary Wharf's Robert John, a director of the joint venture, believes detailed permission should be granted.
An initial capitalisation of 50 million pounds ($83.95 million) will come from the partners. Further funding is expected to come from sale of apartments and bank loans, although Thio Gim Hock would not be drawn on the financing.
HPL, which has a stake in Britain's Virgin Cinemas as well as interests in hotels such as Four Seasons and residential developments, said in July the Canary Wharf scheme would cost around 250 million pounds, although the total cost is likely to be higher given the estimates for the first phase.
Designer Philippe Stark is to shape the hotel and leisure component of the new development, which will include a glass-covered ""infinity"" swimming pool which will give the appearance of dropping into the river Thames below.
Thio Gim Hock said Stark will ""give some sex appeal to the development"", which he says will have a country club atmosphere. He wants the hotel to have its own distinctive character which will be ""elegant, understated and aimed at business people"".
The developers also envisage opportunities for top-class restaurants with river views on the site.
He expects many of the apartments to be sold to people in Britain, but also hopes for overseas interest and foresees some buyers seeking an investment rather than a place to live. HPL's track-record in Singapore will, he said, encourage interest from the company's home patch.
""I have no doubt that a lot of them will come and buy here.""
Work on the Canary Wharf project in the former London docks began in 1987 under Olympia and York, owned by the Reichmann family of Canada.",0
"British property company Greycoat Plc, under fire from a group of shareholders calling for it to be broken up, said on Monday it was confident of getting the support of its institutional shareholders in rejecting the plan.
""I would be very surprised if they (Greycoat's institutional shareholders) would come down on the side of a closing down sale,"" Greycoat's chief executive Peter Thornton told Reuters.
Thornton said he believed the liquidation proposal by the UK Active Value Fund, which will be put to shareholders in 10-days time, was ""ill-conceived and fails to secure shareholder value"".  
Earlier Greycoat wrote to its shareholders urging them to reject the resolution, put forward by rebel shareholder Brian Myerson, at an extraordinary general meeting on November 14.
Myerson's Active Value Advisors Ltd (AVA) advises the UK Active Value Fund and is expected to put out its own response to the statement later today.
Last month Myerson said it was time to ""unlock the value of Greycoat"" as the company's shares stood at a 23 percent discount to the forecast net asset value for 1997.
He said there was ""considerable support"" for the proposal to dispose of Greycoat's assets and enhance shareholder value.  
Greycoat, which focuses on central London office developments, earlier announced a rise in interim pre-tax profits to 3.8 million stg and predicted a final dividend of 1.2 pence per share.
Thornton said the results showed the company was having a very good year, adding it was well placed to take advantage of favourable investor sentiment on the central London property market. ""The whole market is moving in our direction,"" he said.
The share discount to net asset value had been worsened by the fact that UKAV held 10 percent of the shares and this was overhanging the market, he added.  
Martin Poole, Greycoat's finance director, said the company had got its long-term debt in place, adding that its lender banks were not in any way ruffled by the current uncertainty.
""The novelty has worn off from the bank's point of view,"" Poole told Reuters. To get rid of the bank debt, which would be required by any liquidation plans, would cost ""roughly 10 million stg"", he added.
Poole said he expected good growth in the dividend in the medium term, in line with the group's policy of progressively increasing it. ""There is no reason why we shouldn't continue at the higher rate of profit,"" he said.  
While Greycoat does not intend to use further resources on development sites, it is likely to use the cash generated by the sale of its Buckingham Palace Road property for investment.
Thornton said discussions were already underway with several parties, but he stressed the company would not pay over the odds, would not compromise on what it wanted and would not buy anything in the market.
Rather than concentrating on a single asset, there would be two or three purchases or ""possibly more"". Greycoat had around 50 million stg to spend and this would be geared up to around 50 million stg cash and the same amount of debt, Thornton added.",0
"Even if British media and leisure group Pearson decides to sell its interest in merchant banking group Lazards, the bank would not be under immediate threat from larger rivals, banking sources said on Monday.
Marjorie Scardino's accession last week as Pearson chief executive has prompted widespread talk that Pearson would sell its 50 percent in Lazard Partners, which owns the three Lazard houses in London, Paris and New York.
But a pre-emption agreement in cross-shareholdings between Lazards and Pearson would ensure the partnership has first refusal on its own shares if Pearson decides to sell its stake, thus preventing the family-run merchant bank from falling into the hands of larger and expanding international rivals.
""This (speculation) is prompted by the fact that Pearson has a new chief executive who will obviously want to review things,"" one senior corporate financier told Reuters, adding that the pre-emption agreement meant Lazards ""either stays with Pearson or comes within the Lazard empire fully"".
Officials at both Pearson and Lazard Brothers in London declined to comment on talk of a possible sale.
Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London's Lazard Brothers and smaller nine percent stakes in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York. Its 50 percent stake in the umbrella group Lazard Partners was negotiated during the 1980s.
Analysts suggest Lazards does not fit into Pearson's main information, education and entertainment divisions and is therefore a target for being spun off. But banking sources point out that Lazards has been a profitable venture and not a drain.
""It (Lazards) has not required any capital or management time (from Pearson),"" the senior financier added.
Pearson, in its 1995 annual report and accounts, points out that its ""close ties to the three Lazard investment banking houses again proved their worth in 1995"".
It highlighted attributable profits of 39.9 million pounds from the group for that year. If Pearson, described by Michel David-Weill -- senior partner of Lazard Freres in Paris -- as a ""great partner"" to Lazards since 1919, decides to sever its ties with the merchant bank, there could also be other complications.
The Lazard group, which has successfully specialised in corporate finance advisory work as well as asset mangagment and trading activities, holds 48 million Pearson shares.
The Financial Times at the weekend quoted David-Weill as saying Lazards might decide to sell this 360 million pound ($600 million) stake to finance a buy-back of Pearson's holding.
The newspaper said David-Weill had said the Lazards holding in Pearson was equivalent in value to Pearson's Lazard stake.
Although Lazards's stake has been seen as obstacle to a takeover attempt against Pearson, it might sell its shares on the market but in discussion with the group and ""not to a party which could be hostile"", David-Weill told the paper.
While Scardino's role at Pearson has been the subject of close scrutiny since her appointment, Lazards have also been in the news, with suggestions of a power-struggle over who will succeed 64-year-old David-Weill.",0
"British fund manager Invesco announced its widely-flagged merger with U.S. mutual fund company AIM Management Group on Monday, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses.
The combined group will be called AMVESCO Plc and have around $150 billion under management. The merger values AIM at approximately $1.6 billion, Invesco said in a statement.
""We are creating a prototype company for the future,"" Bob McCullough, Invesco's chief financial officer, told Reuters.
Invesco's chairman and chief executive Charles Brady, the man who will lead the new group, said it would have ""the scale necessary for success as a financially strong and independent business operating in an increasingly concentrated industry.""
McCullough stressed the deal was a merger of two companies rather than a takeover, as it had been described in some quarters. The two would combine to focus on revenue enhancement but would retain their individual identities, he added.
""Brand awareness will continue. Both will retain their names in the market place,"" he said.
Invesco said it would fund the merger with the issue of 290 million new shares to existing holders of AIM shares. These would be valued at approximately $1.1 billion. AIM shareholders will own around 45 percent of the enlarged group and be subject to restrictions on selling the shares.
McCullough said the merger, which is conditional on approval by both Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals, would be non-dilutive and would not have any cost savings built-in. However, there would be cost savings in the future, he said.
The merger is not expected to be completed before February.
McCullough also said the $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt, with a one-for-five rights offering on the cards. This would involve issuing roughly 50 million new shares, he said.
McCullough said the cost of the merger was not excessive. ""If you look at it on the basis of funds under management, it (the cost) is less than three percent,"" he said.
""There's no question that it is a lot of money, but we view this as a long-term investment for both of us,"" he said. This long-term commitment was underlined by the fact that almost 50 percent of the combined shares would be held by management.
Invesco had been approached by a number of banks offering it loans, with the debt element being placed with them. Both companies were currently ""largely debt free,"" he said.
The merger presented an enormous number of synergies, with the two companies using different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.
There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a ""no-load"" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM making its sales through intermediaries.
Both companies were ""really active managers"" and would stay that way rather than moving to passive management, McCullough said, adding that Invesco's global infrastructure presented a major opportunity.
He denied the heavy exposure to the U.S. would hinder Invesco from making the most of opportunities in other parts of the world. ""We would like nothing better than to find opportunities in Asia and Europe,"" he said.
The merger would enhance the group's strength in the U.S., increasing the amount of its business there from between 85 and 90 percent to around 95 percent.",0
"British property group MEPC said on Thursday it was pleased with a rise in pretax profits for the year but admitted disappointment at a fall in its net asset value (NAV) to 450 pence per share from 457 pence.
""We feel very confident about the whole of the profit statement. The only slight disappointment is on the NAV side,"" James Tuckey, MEPC's chief executive, said in an interview.
Earlier MEPC announced a 14 percent increase in pretax profit for the year to 140 million stg from 122.6 million stg. Earnings per share rose nine percent to 22.9 pence.  
Tuckey said the NAV fall reflected a marginal fall in values both in Britain and elsewhere but said the NAV drop was less than the relevant indices.
""We feel that the performance of our UK portfolio, which accounts for 70 percent of the group, is indeed where we would have expected it to be,"" he added.
He pointed out the valuation date was August 31 and there had been activity and evidence of an improvement in the market since then. ""If we redid the valuation for December 1, we would probably get a different answer,"" he said.  
Tuckey said the other factor which had brought the NAV down was a significant 31 million stg write-down on the valuation of MEPC's Northridge Mall in Los Angeles. This had been equivalent to 7.5 pence per share.
""We are convinced this is a temporary write-down because the centre is still getting back on its feet after the earthquake some three years ago. We are quite confident we will get that value back in the next two to three years as the centre re-establishes itself,"" Tuckey said.
""We felt that we wanted to share as much information as we could with shareholders,"" he added.  
MEPC's decision to give a target NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001 reflected its repositioning of its portfolio.
""We're sticking our necks out...The portfolio is very very different to what it was three years ago and what we're trying to do is give shareholders some feel of where we think the performance is going to be in five years time,"" Tuckey said.
""We believe we need to share with our stakeholders what it is we are trying to achieve.""
Tuckey said the full impact of the change of strategy in MEPC's portfolio would take time but there would be progress towards the firm's targets each year.  
He said there was a much firmer tone to the markets, particularly in the UK over the last few months. Apart from Northridge, the rest of the U.S. portfolio had performed ""extremely well"".
MEPC plans to keep the lion's share of its portfolio in the UK, with the remainder in the U.S. and Australia. It has wound down its European portfolio and has no plans to go back into continental Europe in the immediate future.
Tuckey said the group was keen to make acquisitions, with the proceeds of its European disposals, but that there was a shortage of good stock available, particularly in the UK.  
While MEPC has resolved to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, Tuckey said he could not predict when it would be increased although he pointed out that dividend cover had improved to 1.15 times from 1.05 a year before.
""It depends on the forward look, on how the markets are feeling,"" he said. The market was competitive and good stock was hard to find but Tuckey said he welcomed the prospect of changes to the way the market functioned with more liquidity likely.
""I think there are changes afoot and they are changes for the good because what they will allow is greater liquidity for the sector, possibly through derivatives or the property investment trusts that have been talked about,"" he said, adding that MEPC would be involved in any such developments.",0
"Britain's Invesco Plc Monday agreed to merge with Houston-based mutual fund company AIM Management Group Inc. in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, creating one of the world's largest investment management businesses.

McCullough said another $500 million needed to fund the merger would come in the form of cash and debt.
The merger presented a chance for the two companies to use different distribution channels and approaches. McCullough said he did not forsee any culture clash between the two.
There would be no change in their differing approaches, with Invesco continuing to be a ""no-load"" house, selling products direct to the customer, and AIM selling its nearly three dozen funds through brokers.

McCullough said the merger must be approved by Invesco and AIM shareholders and other approvals were required. The deal should be completed early next year, the company said.",0
"KPMG, one of the world's big six international accounting and consultancy firms, believes investment in infrastructure and technology has put it on track to hasten revenue growth.
""We would like to be growing faster and are committed to growing faster,"" Jon Madonna, chairman of KPMG International told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.
Earlier the group reported an eight percent rise in worldwide revenues for the fiscal year to September 30, 1996 to $8.1 billion, up from $7.5 billion the year before.
Madonna, who earlier this year said revenue growth in excess of 10 percent was a reasonable expectation, said KPMG had invested heavily in infrastructure and technology during the year and this would pay off in terms of further growth.
He said all sides of the business had performed well over the year but stressed that significant growth in revenues was likely to come from the consulting side of the business rather than from the traditional backbone of auditing and tax.
""If you look at where the great opportunity is, its on the consulting side,"" Madonna said.
While KPMG's growth rate for the year was lower than rival firm Andersen Worldwide, which last month reported a 16 percent increase in 1996 revenues to $9.4 billion, Madonna said he was not disappointed with the firm's result.
When looked at on a dollar-adjusted basis, the 1996 revenue growth was the same as for the previous year, Madonna said.
But there was still work to be done.
""I said a year ago we need to be growing faster. I just think we have got to do a lot better than that. It's a big ship and you don't turn it around in just a few days,"" he added.
The investment and strategic moves KPMG had made had ensured it would be in a strong position for the future. ""The road we are on is the right road"".
Madonna said the firm's partners were agreed that the moves it had made over the year were correct and the fact that everybody wanted faster growth confirmed the need for large-scale investments.
""We are making sizeable dollar investments in terms of infrastructure and product development."" This included around $500 million a year on technology and ""well in excess"" of $100 million on products.
For Madonna the key is what the partnership, which employs more than 77,000 people and has more than 6,250 partners, is doing in three years' time.
The strategy which KPMG has embarked on will not be altered to achieve further revenue growth and areas such as developing new products and establishing a framework of common industries and a common infrastructure across the firm's worldwide business will continue.
Madonna, who believes there will be further consolidation among the big accountancy firms, said KPMG will also stick to growing from within rather than through large-scale acquisition.
The number of major accounting firms in the world has dropped from eight in the mid-1980s to six, with a rise in competition from other types of firms.
But Madonna does not see KPMG making any big buys.
""There will be local acquisitions and mergers down the road but I don't think anything big is on the horizon.""",0
"British property group MEPC on Thursday announced a 14 percent increase in pretax profits for the year but said a writedown on a Los Angeles shopping mall had reduced its net asset value (NAV).
MEPC's chief executive said he was pleased with the rise in pretax profits to 140 million pounds ($227.2 million) from 122.6 million pounds the previous year, but admitted disappointment at the fall in NAV to 450 pence per share from 457 pence.
MEPC shares were 11p lower at 441-1/2p by 1218 GMT as traders said the NAV was below market expectations.
""We feel very confident about the whole of the profit statement. The only slight disappointment is on the NAV side,"" Tuckey said in an interview. Earnings per share rose nine percent to 22.9 pence and the total dividend stayed at 20 pence.
Tuckey said the NAV drop reflected a marginal fall in values both in Britain and elsewhere but it was less than the relevant indices. ""We feel that the performance of our UK portfolio, which accounts for 70 percent of the group, is indeed where we would have expected it to be.""
He pointed out the valuation date for the portfolio was August 31 and there had been activity and evidence of an improved market since then. ""If we redid the valuation for December 1, we would probably get a different answer,"" he said.
The other factor which had brought the NAV down was the 31 million pound write-down on the valuation of MEPC's Northridge Mall. This had been equivalent to 7.5 pence per share.
""We are convinced this is a temporary write-down because the centre is still getting back on its feet after the earthquake some three years ago. We are quite confident we will get that value back in the next two to three years as the centre re-establishes itself,"" he said.
And he defended MEPC's decision to give a target NAV of 690 pence per share for 2001.
""We're sticking our necks out...The portfolio is very very different to what it was three years ago and what we're trying to do is give shareholders some feel of where we think the performance is going to be in five years time,"" Tuckey said.
Tuckey said the full impact of the change of strategy in MEPC's portfolio would take time but there would be progress towards the firm's targets each year.
He said there was a much firmer tone to the markets, particularly in Britain over the last few months. Apart from Northridge, the rest of the U.S. portfolio had performed ""extremely well"".
MEPC plans to keep the lion's share of its portfolio in Britain, with the remainder in the United States and Australia. It has wound down its European portfolio and has no plans to go back into continental Europe in the immediate future.
Tuckey said the group was keen to make acquisitions, with the proceeds of its European disposals, but that there was a shortage of good stock available, particularly in Britain.
While MEPC has resolved to increase the dividend paid to shareholders, Tuckey said he could not predict when it would be increased although he pointed out that dividend cover had improved to 1.15 times from 1.05 a year before.
""It depends on the forward look, on how the markets are feeling,"" he said. The market was competitive and good stock was hard to find but Tuckey said he welcomed the prospect of changes to the way the market functioned with more liquidity likely.",0
"Financial services and property group Liberty International Holdings on Thursday unveiled a move into the British pensions market in ventures involving the British Telecom Pension Scheme and pension fund management group Hermes.
Liberty is establishing its own pensions company, Liberty International Pensions, which will target both the needs of money purchase pension schemes and retail pensions.
BT Pension Scheme, which owns Hermes, is to pay five million pounds ($7.8 million) for 10 percent of the equity of Liberty International Pensions, with the rest held by Liberty.
Liberty and Hermes said in a joint statement they were also setting up a new subsidiary called Hermes Liberty International Pensions to offer specialised investment services to the British pensions industry, with Hermes as fund manager.
BT Pension Scheme is giving the Hermes Liberty joint venture ""critical mass from the outset"" with a 1.5 billion pound transfer of assets to the new funds, Liberty's chairman Donald Gordon said.
Gordon said Liberty was ""well positioned to take advantage of the changes affecting the UK pensions industry."" Hermes' expertise in investment management and track record would help it to provide quality and competitively priced pension services.
David Fischel, Liberty's managing director, said Liberty International Pensions still required approval of Britain's Department of Trade and Industry but was otherwise ready for launch.
Hermes called the joint pensions venture a meeting of minds.
""Liberty has the ability and techniques of selling pensions, it also has the systems...and the administration. We on the other hand are good at our particular core areas of investment management...we think that's a very good marriage,"" Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of Hermes, said.
Ross Goobey said Hermes had approached Liberty International only to find the group had been considering an approach to Hermes.
""It really was a meeting of minds on this. Whether it develops further from this we shall see. I think one step at a time is quite enough for us.""
He said the venture would probably not be up and running until the first quarter of next year as regulatory approval first had to be obtained for the new group.
The decision by the giant British Telecom Pension Scheme to transfer assets to the new Hermes Liberty International Pensions funds would give the new venture a boost.
""I would hope it gives some people some feeling of security that BT Pension Scheme, which is after all the biggest in the country, is willing to do this,"" he said.
Liberty plans to sell personal pensions at its regional shopping centres, which are held through a majority-owned subsidiary Capital Shopping Centres. These have more than 150 million customer visits a year, Liberty said.",0
"Top managers in major financial firms need to be razor-sharp if the world's increasingly complex markets are to run smoothly, however sophisticated the regulatory regime, regulators and politicians said on Thursday.
""Management needs to know its business. (It) sets the ethos of the company,"" Alistair Darling, spokesman on treasury affairs for Britain's opposition Labour party told a conference on financial regulation and minimising systemic risk.
Examples of where rules had been broken by so-called ""rogue traders"" were a clear sign of management failure, he said.
Christine Cumming, senior vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also voiced doubts about management's current ability to deal with regulatory problems.
The health of an institution lay in its management and directors, but they were not necessarily properly armed to deal with problems when they arose, she said.
""Do we prepare directors and managers enough?"" Cumming said.
Britain's often criticised regulatory system, which relies heavily on so-called ""self-regulation,"" is also under scrutiny.
Darling said that whichever party won the next general election, due by May 1997, the British regulatory system ""will be reformed."" But this would not mean ""tearing everything up or dramatic change,"" he added.
He said Labour wanted to establish a regulator with sufficient ""clout reputation and stature"" to deal with its international counterparts.
But it would not create a ""Super-SIB,"" an enlarged version of the top regulator the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), as some commentators have suggested. A Labour government would also attempt to limit the number of regulations.
Darling's call for minimising the regulatory burden by making it as cost-effective as possible was echoed by most of the speakers at the conference.
Angela Knight, Britain's economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wants to see a cost-benefit analysis applied to all regulations. If they fail to make sense on this basis then they should not be adopted, she said.
Knight also underlined the dramatic effect on the industry as a whole of the collapse of blue-blooded merchant bank Barings in February 1995 was ""a more salutory lesson than any regulation"" to other banks and financial institutions.
There were calls from both politicians for interchange between industry and the regulators, so that the experiences on either side of the fence could be carried across by individuals.
But while the idea of the regulators being staffed by people with first-hand industry knowledge won support from many of those attending the meeting, the question of how the pay structure could accomodate such movements was seen by some as a serious obstacle to this system spreading.
And while regulators need to keep up with rapid changes in financial instruments and the industry landscape both on a domestic and a global scale, they can never be expected to be one step ahead of the business they are monitoring.
""Regulators should respond to business realities rather than be ahead of business trends,"" Sir Andrew Large, chairman of the SIB told the meeting.
This would mean regulators becoming increasingly sophisticated to cope with the changing business environment and having to co-operate more and more with their counterparts in other countries.
""The next generation of supervisors will have to evaluate far more complex information and make far more complex judgements,"" Large said.",0
"Privately owned British investment bank Robert Fleming on Wednesday announced increased pre-tax profits for the first half of the year which it said underlined its ability to remain independent.
""We are committed to remaining independent. These results, our second best interim results ever, show we can remain independent,"" a Robert Fleming spokesman told Reuters.
Flemings has been widely talked about as a possible takeover target for a larger foreign investment bank, but has resolutely said it would retain its independence.
Flemings said its pretax profit for the first half of the year had increased by 16 percent to 92.2 million pounds ($154 million), from 79.4 million pounds a year earlier but warned it would have to cope with difficult markets in the second half.
Some analysts said the increase was not particularly impressive given market conditions but chief executive John Manser said it was ""a very good start"" and showed new businesses were ""making a valuable contribution to profitability.""
""While the outlook for the year seems promising, flat Asian markets and heightened competitive pressures in other markets are factors that we will continue to have to contend with during the next six months,"" Manser said in a statement.
The Flemings official said the results showed that while Flemings may have been perceived as an Asian-centric bank, it was now a much more international operation and had succeeded in bringing down its cost income ratio.
Flemings has not had an easy year so far. In July it lost investment banking head Bill Harrison who was poached by BZW, the investment banking arm of Britain's Barclays.
And in August Jardine Fleming, a joint venture with Jardine Matheson, revealed a five-month probe by British and Hong Kong regulators into irregular trades by a former senior fund manager at Jardine Fleming Investment Management.
This resulted in hefty fines and voluntary compensation of nearly $20 million to clients. Regulators also withdrew the authorisation of Jardine Fleming's London-based fund company. In September the company's chairman retired and the group created a new supervisory board.
Flemings acknowledged the problems at Jardine Fleming meant the joint venture had recorded a ""marginally lower"" interim result than its net interim profit of $63.9 million in 1995.
This was after taking into account provisions ""arising from the regulatory issues relating to earlier years,"" it said. The Flemings spokesman told Reuters some clients had been lost, but new clients had also been taken on.
He described the events as a ""painful experience."" ""But we believe we have clearly drawn a line in the sand,"" he added.
Any impact these problems may have had on Flemings' overall business was not, however, reflected in the interim dividend which rose to eight pence per share from seven pence.
Flemings said it had seen strong profit growth from its fund management businesses adding that its securities business had reported ""a marked increase in profits aided by a strong performance by UK and continental European broking.""
Its capital markets arm had helped companies raise 13.4 billion pounds of new capital while its corporate finance division had completed 43 deals during the period.
The appointment of Manser, 56, to replace Robin Fleming, 64, who will retire as chairman of Robert Fleming Holdings at the end of March 1997, means Manser would be more involved in business development and winning new business as well as strategy and relationships with major clients and shareholders.
William Garrett, 50, who was hired by Manser as a fund manager in 1970, was named as his replacement as chief executive and chairman of the group executive committee. Garrett will be responsible for the day-to-day running of the group.",0

"Hunting so-called ""fat cats"" - the biggest company boardroom earners - may have become a British media obsession but the pay packets of the country's top players are under even closer scrutiny from institutional shareholders.
The latest row, between electronics giant General Electric Co and some of its major shareholders who objected to a 10 million pound ($15.61 million) five-year package for new managing director George Simpson, resulted in GEC setting tougher performance targets.
But questions remain over how much the individuals charged with running some of Britain's most, and in some cases least, successful companies deserve to be paid and have led to a reappraisal of the fundamentals of corporate governance.
Both last year's Greenbury committee on executive pay and the earlier Cadbury report on corporate governance laid down guidelines on how companies should behave. But not all the rules are compulsory and some firms have opted not to toe the line.
This has led to a more active approach by leading institutional shareholders like Norwich Union and has seen greater involvement from bodies such as the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension funds.
""Institutional shareholders are paying a lot more attention to these issues, not perhaps out of choice but because of circumstances. We do think remuneration issues are important but perhaps get more publicity than they should,"" Anita Skipper, corporate governance manager at Norwich Union told Reuters.
Skipper said the group, which has been looking at corporate governance issues for more than a decade, does not generally give a view on the general package an executive receives, but tries to ensure a company's performance justifies the benefit.
This means close scrutiny of every aspect of the company's performance, including factors such as its return on capital, cashflow, the way it is managed and its prospects.
""It's good to see the big investing institutions flexing their muscles and taking an active interest in this way,"" one industry insider told Reuters.
Last week Tim Melville-Ross, director general of the Institute of Directors, rallied behind Simpson, arguing that very few people were capable of doing the job.
Melville-Ross also sat on the Greenbury panel which urged the remuneration committees - which decide directors' salaries - to take into account the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and industry.
A row over a new executive bonus scheme at British power and water giant United Utilities in July fuelled public outrage at the million-pound packages that executive directors of monopoly utilities have managed to amass since privatisation.
Last year, chairman of Marks and Spencer Sir Richard Greenbury was given the job of attempting to impose curbs following public outrage over the pay of Cedric Brown, formerly the chief executive of British Gas.
""That was a watershed. That was what raised public awareness of the issue (of directors' pay),"" Norwich Union's Skipper said.
The Greenbury committee said a number of privatised water and energy companies ""have developed, perhaps unintentionally, remuneration packages which are richer than required to recruit, retain and motivate quality managers"".
Skipper maintains that revealing directors' pay is a requirement of good corporate governance. ""It should be there for shareholder scrutiny,"" she said.
But her view is not appreciated by all directors. One director of a quoted financial institution, recently told Reuters he was firmly against having his salary and pension details published not least because of the potential personal repurcussions.
His mother-in-law happens to be a shareholder and receives the company's annual report and accounts and he confided that she has since hinted she will re-write her will in favour of her other children.",0
"- The chief financial officer of debt-ridden Rogers Communications Inc., resigned suddenly Monday.
Graham Savage, well-respected by analysts and considered a restraining force on flamboyant president Ted Rogers, had been with the firm for 21 years. He resigned to ""pursue other interests,"" the company said.
""Of all the senior individuals who have left Rogers in recent times, the departure of Savage is the most detrimental to the company, given Savage is the man who has held it all together for the past few years,"" said Lawrence and Co. analyst Andrew McCreath.
Analyst John Drolet at Toronto's Yorkton Securities said, ""This is not good for Rogers at all. I wouldn't be surprised if other people left.""
Rogers, which also owns Rogers Cantel, a wireless communications firm, has shed U.S. and Canadian assets in the past year in an attempt to cut its debts. Rogers piled up most of its debt load when it acquired Maclean Hunter Ltd., along with the Toronto Sun group, for C$3.1 billion ($2.26 billion).
Total long-term debt grew to C$4.88 billion ($3.56 billion) as of June 30 from a year-earlier C$4.07 billion ($2.97 billion).
In 1995, Rogers had revenue of C$2.69 billion ($1.96 billion).
""Graham Savage was a pretty good guy. He was able to keep the wolves away as ... Ted Rogers kept adding on assets. But I guess he finally realized that there's an end to the line,"" Drolet said.
Alan Horn, vice-president of administration, will serve as acting chief financial officer until another is found, the company said.
In a statement, Ted Rogers said: ""We remain committed to the near-term financial priorities of improving our balance sheet and increasing revenues as we invest in new businesses.""

On the broader market, advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones 558 to 398. Another 318 traded unchanged.
""These markets are holding up really well,"" said RBC Dominion Securities private client strategist Dunnery Best. ""The fact that Canada held on to big gains is very powerful.""
The TSE 300 Index gained about 90 points this week.
Trading volume was 96.7 million shares worth C$1.58 billion (US$1.17 billion).
The activity was surprisingly heavy since analysts had expected trading to fall off after the New York Stock Exchange closed early for the U.S. Thanksgiving long weekend.
Best expected further gains for the TSE as the year end approaches and Canadians think about buying mutual funds for their registered retirement savings plans.
Ten of Toronto's 14 sub-indices ended higher, led by conglomerates, media, transport and real estate. But the key index was depressed by soft bank stocks and a weak gold sector which lost nearly one percent.
Among the hot stocks, the bank stocks suffered profit taking after strong gains earlier this week on record year-end earnings. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce fell C$1.10 to close at C$60.70. Toronto-Dominion Bank dropped C$1.00 to C$36.00 on 1.3 million shares.

""Canada very often is just following New York,"" said Montreal-based portfolio consultant Ron Meisels.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index fell 17.31 points to close at 6058.67. Trading was brisk on turnover of 123.1 million shares worth C$1.97 billion ($1.47 billion).
Wall Street was volatile after analysts were disappointed with fourth quarter earnings from computer giant International Business Machines Corp., they said.
Toronto's three-day decline is considered a healthy breather after strong gains earlier this year, Meisels said. ""A pause is perfectly natural.""
Toronto's 14 sub-indices were equally split between gaining and losing ones. The weaker side was led by battered golds, oils, base metals and consumer products. Stronger sectors included media, transports and pipelines.
Declining stocks outnumbered advances 559 to 450 while 271 traded unchanged.
Shares in the nation's largest airline Air Canada rose 0.75 to 8.00 on ten million shares. Investors were comparing Air Canada's favourable outlook with financially troubled competitor Canadian Airlines Corp. as both waded back into a profit-cutting seat sale, one analyst said.

"Toronto stocks posted their 51st record close of 1996 on Monday, powered by a rally in interest-sensitive issues ahead of an expected cut in Canadian interest rates, analysts said.
""(The) market is looking for yet another Bank of Canada cut,"" said MMS International analyst Katherine Beattie.
Canada's central bank has dropped short-term interest rates 19 times since May 1995, slashing the key bank rate by 4.75 percent to stimulate a lackluster economy.
""If there's another Bank of Canada cut, the bank stocks will continue rallying,"" Beattie said.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's key 300 Composite Index gained 17.95 points to close at 5609.26 points, reaching its 51st record close of 1996.
However, the overall market was mixed despite the rally in bank stocks. Declining issues outnumbered advances 478 to 447 with 300 issues unchanged.
A total of 88.7 million shares were traded worth C$1.28 billion (US$958 million) at Canada's largest stock exchange.

"Several large-capitalization Canadian stocks could benefit, while others may be hurt when the Toronto Stock Exchange changes rules governing control blocks in its key 300 Composite Index on Friday.
Stocks such as Barrick Gold Corp, funeral home operator Loewen Group Inc and energy firm Petro-Canada should get snapped up by fund managers when the rules change, analysts said.
""Index funds, which try to match the weighting of the index, are going to have to scramble to buy X percent more Barrick shares...by Friday,"" said an analyst who declined to be identified.
The Toronto Stock Exchange, which handles more than 80 percent of Canada's equity trading, will increase the relative weighting of 30 stocks on Friday by raising the level of control blocks to 20 percent from 15 percent.
The change will take effect at the start of trading on Friday.
Relative weighting describes the impact a stock or sub-group has on the overall TSE 300 Composite Index.
A control block is a group of shares owned by a single entity. Control blocks are not considered part of a stock's weighting because these shares cannot freely trade in the market.
Under the new rules, the federal government's 18.26 percent holding in Petro-Canada Inc will be included in the company's overall float. Petro-Canada's will therefore see its weighting rise to 1.22 percent from about 1.03 percent.
The TSE is changing the definition of a control block to comply with Ontario Securities Commission reporting rules, said Tara O'Donnell, director of derivative markets management.
The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, one of Canada's biggest pension fund managers, will need to make some changes, said Zev Frishman, manager of quantitative products.
Teachers' has almost C$45 billion in assets with a third of its money in Canadian equities.
""I cannot go into specific numbers or anything like that, but in essence we will have to, to some extent, adjust positions,"" Frishman said.
Barrick will likely be one of the stocks snapped up, analysts said.
Barrick, which is 15.7 percent owned by Trizec Hahn Corp, will now be weighted based on 100 percent of its shares from 84.3 percent. As a result, the world's third largest gold producer will see its relative weighting in the TSE 300 increase to 3.28 percent from 2.84 percent.
Loewen's weighting will jump to about 1.74 percent from about 0.64 percent, after a control block held by chief executive Raymond Loewen and his wife is included.
Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Services (OMERS) said it expected the control block changes to have little impact on its funds.
""You have to remember that the actual changes relative to the market overall are quite small,"" said Tom Gunn, senior vice-president of OMERS' investment division.
The list of 30 affected stocks also includes gold producer Franco-Nevada Mining Corp Ltd, Quebecor Printing Inc, publisher Hollinger Inc, energy firm Gulf Canada Resources Ltd and Shaw Industries Ltd.
Others are Astral Communications Inc, BC Sugar Refinery Ltd, CCL Industries Inc and Co-Steel Inc, Corel Corp, Cognos Inc, Cinram Ltd., Edper Group Ltd and First Marathon Inc and Tee-Comm Electronics Inc.",0

Toronto's key 300 Composite Index rose 4.48 points to close at 6145.41 in turnover of 115.4 million shares worth C$1.8 billion ($1.3 billion).
Investors snapped up banks and other financial service stocks in anticipation that the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee will announce it is keeping short-term interest rates unchanged following a two-day meeting which ends on Wednesday, analysts said.
""The most exciting group today was none other than the financial services,"" said RBC Dominion Securities investment advisor Ira Katzin.
""The feeling is that interest rates are not going to rise,"" he said.
Advancing stocks outpaced declines 506 to 464 while another 303 issues were unchanged.

Wall Street rose 53.11 points to close at 6762.29 on stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings from computer chip maker Intel Corp. Earnings per share jumped to $2.13 from a year-earlier $0.98.
Today's rally in Toronto was also aided by the start of the 1996 pension season, when Canadians rush into last-minute investing in tax sheltered funds before the traditional end-February deadline.
""The RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) season is beginning,"" said Midland Walwyn's director of private client investing Dunnery Best.

The heavyweight gold sector also fell along with softer bullion prices in New York. Comex April gold lost US$1.30 to close at US$345.10 an ounce.
The three strong sectors were real estate, transportation and retailing.
Declining stocks edged out advances 545 to 402 while 276 issues were unchanged.
Schachter said he expected the downdraft to continue for the next few sessions, pulling the Canadian market down by another 100 points. However, oil stocks may bounce back if the rest of the North American winter remains cold and demand for energy improves.
Among active stocks, oil producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. fell 1.95 to close at 34.25 on 2.6 million shares.

Falling issues powered ahead of advancing ones 596 to 380. Another 277 traded flat.
However, traders said today's weakness was a temporary blip ahead of more year-end gains. In the past mutual fund managers tended to shuffle portfolios before Christmas to provide a strong finish to their year, which has boosted equities markets, they said.
Among the hot stocks, shares in gold prospector Bre-X Minerals Ltd. were still volatile ahead of a potential partnership deal with Barrick Gold Corp. over Bre-X's huge gold discovery in Busang, Indonesia.

"She once jokingly thought of calling her autobiography ""Fascist Bitch,"" and now Canadian journalists are wondering what epithet to use as she plays an expanding role in the country's largest newspaper empire.
British-born Barbara Amiel, the wife of Hollinger Inc. chairman Conrad Black, is an accomplished journalist who counts many fans in Britain, where she writes a rightwing shoot-from-the-hip column for the Daily Telegraph, the centerpiece of the Hollinger empire.
Although she honed her craft in Canada, she makes many Canadians bristle by standing out from the mass of generally liberal journalists. She says she has never managed to reap the accolades she desires from Canadians, the ones she routinely receives from the British.
A sought-after London party guest, Amiel now is in the Canadian spotlight through her position as vice president of editorial in her husband's newspaper empire. Hollinger added a majority shareholding in Southam Inc., the country's largest daily newspaper chain, to its media stable, substantially boosting its control to more than 40 percent of the industry.
The move left some Canadians worried about Hollinger's influence on their media and many Southam journalists fearful for their jobs as Black's well-known road to profits often involves cutting newspaper staff.
HUSBAND CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF
At a recent conference of journalists in Ottawa, Amiel, a former Toronto Sun editor, was repeatedly asked about Black's intentions. She replied that he could speak for himself. But she added, ""I think the Southam papers ... have not done their best but have terrific potential.""
Amiel, who still writes for Maclean's magazine, hesitated when asked if she was treated differently in Canada than abroad. ""I think Canada's been very good to me. I became editor of a newspaper, (former editor) Peter Newman gave me a column in Maclean's magazine, how many people have got that? You can't complain.""
But then she added, ""I've never, although one always wants it, had the recognition of my peers that I've had in England, but then maybe I didn't deserve it in Canada.""
Television personality Alan Edmonds, an admirer of Amiel who disagrees with her views, said Canadians have refrained from praising Amiel's talents because of her rightwing bias. ""In the years that she was in Canada ... the prevailing mindset in the media was in the opposite direction.""
Edmonds said other journalists were jealous of the openings that came her way. ""She's used her undoubted feminine attraction to ... create opportunities to use her undoubted superior intellect.""
In person and in print, Amiel has a knack for sparking debates. For instance, she once wrote that Quebec's moves toward independence, culminating in a narrow 1995 defeat for the separatists, could be blamed on Canada's liberal elite, which promoted multi-culturalism, thereby strengthening French-Canadian nationalism.
CASTIGATING LEFTWINGERS
Her columns have castigated Ontario's former leftwing government, led by the New Democratic Party, for allegedly being swayed by special interest groups like the disabled. She also wrote that Ontario, which gave homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, had weakened the family.
Canada's most widely read satirical magazine, Frank, noted ""a favorite theme in her columns is the insidiousness of self-pity, that the poor should get on with their lives and quit carping about it."" And columnist Allan Fotheringham once observed, ""Barbara Amiel, otherwise known as Mrs. Conrad Black, can take out any opponent in the world and eat them for breakfast. As she does regularly in print.""
Amiel has even joked about her reputation, saying she thought about calling her surprisingly frank 1980 autobiography ""Fascist Bitch,"" a name suggested by irate readers. Instead the book was titled ""Confessions.""
Now in her mid-50s, the much-married Amiel began her path at the tender age of eight at a ""grotty little newspaper"" in her hometown of Hendon, England. Her parents divorced, her mother remarried and her new Canadian stepfather dragged his new family back home. Amiel, used to fine surroundings, ended up in Hamilton, a gritty steel town in southern Ontario about 40 miles (70 km) from Toronto.
Before her 1991 marriage to Black, she was married to student Gary Smith, philosopher George Jonas and cable magnate David Graham, with whom she returned to England in 1985.
In 1993 well-known Canadian author Margaret Atwood published ""The Robber Bride"" about a scapel-assisted femme fatale named Zenia. The Canadian rumor mill identified Amiel as the model for Zenia, but she denied it.",0
